Theme: Unfortunate Love

0:00:14.000,0:00:37.000
Perturbed by the thoughts on my mind
no matter how hard I try to sever my love.

0:00:37.000,0:00:47.000
I could give away my crown for the beauty by my side,

0:00:48.000,0:00:59.000
but the wheel of fortune turns weals into woes, 
and woes into weals.

0:00:59.000,0:01:11.000
No one is the master of their own destiny,
the vicissitudes throughout their life.

0:01:11.000,0:01:22.000
For all the lovers in the world, 
who can break the spell of romance?

Episode 4

0:02:23.740,0:02:27.000
Your Highness, Fuzi is dead.

0:02:28.500,0:02:30.380
Dead?

0:02:32.500,0:02:34.320
That's news to me!

0:02:34.820,0:02:36.220
When did that happen?

0:02:36.220,0:02:39.400
Her swollen dead body was just pulled out of a well.

0:02:40.500,0:02:42.940
Mind your tongue when speaking to her Highness.

0:02:42.940,0:02:44.380
It's okay.

0:02:44.500,0:02:48.440
She was running out of room crying that morning.

0:02:48.440,0:02:50.480
She must have lost her footing in the dark.

0:02:51.080,0:02:54.500
So it was my fault that she died?

0:02:54.500,0:02:57.600
Of course not. She's a maid with attitude.

0:02:57.600,0:03:00.740
A maid has to be comfortable with criticism.

0:03:00.740,0:03:02.660
Doesn't she, Mr. Jiang?

0:03:02.660,0:03:06.000
I'm not sure.

0:03:06.320,0:03:07.980
You are not sure?

0:03:07.980,0:03:13.280
You can ask anyone in my palace whether they saw Fuzi ran away.

0:03:14.000,0:03:20.020
Are you implying that we pushed her from behind?

0:03:20.520,0:03:21.520
I would't dare.

0:03:21.520,0:03:22.940
But you did!

0:03:22.940,0:03:26.840
I have offered you the chance to interrogate anyone in my palace.

0:03:26.840,0:03:29.460
I did not intend to do that.

0:03:29.460,0:03:31.480
Let me put it this way,

0:03:31.480,0:03:35.640
The Empress sent you to look into Fuzi's death.

0:03:35.640,0:03:39.500
You've asked your questions and I've answered.

0:03:39.500,0:03:46.480
You have my permission to take away my servants 
for interrogation. Don't you dare question me again!

0:03:48.140,0:03:51.640
I shall take my leave.

0:04:05.200,0:04:13.300
You are all reminded that Fuzi ran out
by herself and fell into the well.

0:04:14.900,0:04:16.840
Yes, sir.

0:04:22.420,0:04:24.440
It smells so good.

0:04:28.920,0:04:33.400
My Lady, you didn't eat since you were frightened yesterday morning.

0:04:33.440,0:04:36.620
You should have breakfast today.

0:04:36.620,0:04:43.360
Not just for one day, we will be living in fear every day.

0:04:43.360,0:04:45.200
How's that?

0:04:46.500,0:04:51.160
Attendant Summer was just one of enemies to Margaret and myself.

0:04:55.280,0:05:00.400
The merciless Consort Fleur might be another.

0:05:00.400,0:05:04.580
My life is threatened by the surrounding enemies.

0:05:04.580,0:05:09.220
And My entire family will be in danger if I fall into their trap.

0:05:09.500,0:05:11.180
What should we do?

0:05:12.500,0:05:15.200
I don't know.

0:05:20.000,0:05:23.760
My Lady, would you like desserts made of the osmanthus flowers?

0:05:23.760,0:05:27.920
I can make some right away since it's in season.

0:05:27.920,0:05:30.560
You will like it.

0:05:31.800,0:05:35.540
Thank you, I will eat anything you make.

0:05:37.000,0:05:38.980
I'll ask for help.

0:06:07.000,0:06:09.900
Violet, is everything okay?

0:06:09.900,0:06:12.660
My Lady, I was just looking at the ants.

0:06:17.660,0:06:22.860
They are making a detour, seems like they are avoiding something.

0:06:24.040,0:06:27.860
That's odd. What could they be avoiding?

0:06:29.660,0:06:34.260
Xiao-Yunzi, dig up around here to see what's underneath.

0:06:37.140,0:06:39.580
Oh, there's something buried down here.

0:06:41.500,0:06:43.400
It looks like a jar.

0:06:43.400,0:06:44.380
Take it out.

0:06:46.000,0:06:49.960
What's happening?

0:06:50.920,0:06:52.540
What is it?

0:06:52.540,0:06:53.960
It's none of your business.

0:06:59.360,0:07:03.500
The jar has a strong smell.

0:07:10.160,0:07:15.720
It could be something that belonged to Lady Parfum.

0:07:15.720,0:07:20.540
Like potpourri [dried flowers and spices to put in sachets].

0:07:21.000,0:07:24.380
We might be able to use it for sachets.

0:07:29.080,0:07:31.080
Here, I got this.

0:07:32.000,0:07:34.000
Open it.

0:07:38.140,0:07:39.860
It stinks!

0:07:41.860,0:07:45.420
It's just rotten spices.
Jade, wrap it up.

0:07:46.540,0:07:49.380
You must not say anything about the jar of spices.

0:07:49.380,0:07:51.840
It would churn up gossip.

0:07:51.840,0:07:52.500
Yes.

0:07:52.500,0:07:55.240
Vermilion, let's have the desserts tomorrow.

0:07:56.440,0:07:58.860
Everyone go back to work.

0:08:01.000,0:08:03.000
Jade, let's go inside.

0:08:04.000,0:08:05.200
Take it away.

0:08:12.000,0:08:14.240
My Lady, are you all right?

0:08:14.240,0:08:17.480
I feel sick.

0:08:18.960,0:08:22.580
Can you send for Mr. Wen?

0:08:23.500,0:08:27.080
I need to see him.

0:08:45.500,0:08:47.500
Mr. Wen!

0:08:48.000,0:08:49.600
I'm glad you're on shift.

0:08:49.600,0:08:54.000
Attendant Sourire is not feeling well.
She wishes to see you.

0:08:54.780,0:08:55.900
Is she all right?

0:08:55.900,0:08:58.920
She only told me that she needed to see you.

0:08:58.920,0:09:00.260
Please go quickly.

0:09:14.500,0:09:18.180
You seem intensely scared.

0:09:20.500,0:09:24.480
I saw things I shouldn't have.

0:09:24.480,0:09:27.100
You should try to put them out of your mind.

0:09:29.000,0:09:34.640
Do you keep the promise that you made outside the temple?

0:09:34.640,0:09:39.040
Yes, I will forever put you first.

0:09:42.420,0:09:51.540
Forever is easier said than done.

0:09:51.540,0:09:57.180
My promise will stand the test of time.

0:09:57.180,0:10:01.500
I promise to repay your family for saving my father's life.

0:10:05.500,0:10:08.960
My Lady, I will do anything you say.

0:10:18.300,0:10:20.520
I don't want to sleep with the emperor.

0:10:26.740,0:10:32.220
As Shichu, I don't want that to happen either.

0:10:32.500,0:10:38.840
But as your doctor in the palace,
I hope you can do it as soon as possible.

0:10:38.840,0:10:42.780
But I'm too scared ...

0:10:44.980,0:10:49.080
Mr. Wen, I'd like to show you something.

0:10:59.300,0:11:02.660
How did this come into your possession?

0:11:02.660,0:11:09.380
The apple tree in my palace did not produce flowers this spring.

0:11:09.380,0:11:14.320
I discovered a jar by chance under the tree.

0:11:14.800,0:11:20.560
I suppose this is the cause of Lady Parfum's miscarriage

0:11:22.000,0:11:25.280
and a trace of the bitter rivalries in the palace.

0:11:26.000,0:11:30.500
Lady Parfum might not even know what caused her downfall.

0:11:31.080,0:11:37.100
It was a timely discovery. Otherwise,
all the girls in your palace would be affected.

0:11:37.100,0:11:45.260
Although I'm unable to be the man of your life,
I promise to guarantee you a peaceful life.

0:11:47.820,0:11:50.900
Can you delay my recovery?

0:11:50.900,0:11:56.760
It is basically emotional distress.
You will be fine within two weeks.

0:11:59.500,0:12:06.440
But if you wish to take it slow, I'll make it slow.

0:12:13.500,0:12:23.680
Musk can cause miscarriage or lifelong infertility.
I shall put it to good use at the dispensary.

0:12:26.000,0:12:31.320
I can't stop feeling scared.

0:12:32.840,0:12:34.280
Don't worry.

0:12:36.420,0:12:40.300
Vermilion, please walk Mr. Wen to the door.

0:12:51.500,0:12:54.500
Attendant Sourire is sick?

0:12:54.500,0:12:59.000
She caught a cold from the changing weather,
and was intensely scared lately.

0:12:59.000,0:13:01.160
She shows symptoms of a plague.

0:13:01.160,0:13:03.060
A plague?

0:13:03.060,0:13:06.260
Her health is suffering as result of emotional distress.

0:13:06.260,0:13:09.000
She has a high fever and experiences difficulty in talking. 

0:13:09.000,0:13:14.000
In that case, Attendant Sourire must be quarantined.

0:13:14.540,0:13:24.720
That would be the best.
The disease is highly likely to be infectious.

0:13:24.720,0:13:26.760
I'll have Attendant Chun move out.

0:13:26.760,0:13:34.380
It might take long for Attendant Sourire to recover.
I hope you can take good care of her.

0:13:34.380,0:13:38.500
I will spare no effort.

0:13:38.500,0:13:44.140
The new concubines can serve Your Majesty tonight.
Or do you prefer to visit Consort Fleur?

0:13:45.300,0:13:47.840
You wouldn't like that, would you?

0:13:47.840,0:13:52.740
I dare not influence your decision.
The Attendance Services is ready.

0:14:03.120,0:14:05.720
Your Majesty, please select a concubine.

0:14:11.700,0:14:13.820
I do not see the name tag for Attendant Sourire.

0:14:13.820,0:14:23.900
Your Majesty, the Imperial Infirmary reported that
Attendant Sourire is in quarantine for a plague.

0:14:23.900,0:14:25.660
A plague?

0:14:26.160,0:14:32.080
It was caused by her mental illness. She was shocked when
Consort Fleur punished Attendant Summer with the Scarlet Red.

0:14:32.080,0:14:35.700
Miss Summer is paralyzed.

0:14:35.700,0:14:36.880
Why was she punished?

0:14:36.880,0:14:40.540
She intended to beat a concubine.

0:14:41.000,0:14:43.520
But that's too harsh of a penalty.

0:14:43.520,0:14:47.080
It is, but violence is the penalty for violence in the palace.

0:14:47.500,0:14:54.660
Consort Fleur's maid, Fuzi, died in a well.
And Attendant Sourire saw her dead body.

0:14:54.660,0:14:58.300
What did Consort Fleur say?

0:14:58.300,0:15:03.560
She said Fuzi lost her footing,
but Jiang Fuhai didn't believe her.

0:15:05.860,0:15:12.860
Maids are from the Eight Banners. That's ... (tut)

0:15:12.860,0:15:16.280
Keep investigating.

0:15:17.980,0:15:20.500
Well, Attendant Sourire is sick ...

0:15:20.500,0:15:24.000
But the punishment didn't affect her friends,
Lady Shen and Companion An.

0:15:26.100,0:15:28.780
[Lady Shen]

0:15:30.620,0:15:33.040
Congratulations, Lady Shen.

0:15:35.500,0:15:39.660
His Majesty selected you for tonight.

0:15:39.660,0:15:45.600
You are the first one to serve His Majesty among the new concubines.

0:15:45.600,0:15:48.440
Thank you, sir.
Lunar.

0:15:50.500,0:15:51.840
Thank you.

0:15:51.840,0:15:58.600
No need to thank me.
My Lady, you should go get ready.

0:15:58.800,0:16:01.840
But what should I do?

0:16:02.940,0:16:11.000
This is Madam Liu, she will prepare you for the service.

0:16:11.200,0:16:16.780
You will be taken to the Hall of Mental Cultivation by the Phoenix Carriage.

0:16:16.780,0:16:21.840
Good luck, My Lady.

0:16:21.840,0:16:24.160
I bid you a good night.

0:16:24.160,0:16:26.520
Take care.

0:16:30.940,0:16:33.880
Your Majesty, Lady Shen is here.

0:16:33.880,0:16:36.000
Carry her in.

0:17:09.400,0:17:11.360
Your Majesty.

0:17:16.020,0:17:19.780
It was very kind of His Majesty to send you a garden of chrysanthemums.

0:17:20.840,0:17:24.740
That's the only flower we have in autumn.

0:17:25.920,0:17:28.200
His Majesty is very fond of you, My Lady.

0:17:28.200,0:17:33.880
It's been a month since we moved in.
His Majesty favors you the most among the new concubines.

0:17:33.880,0:17:38.860
You are the most frequently summoned concubine,
with the most generous rewards.

0:17:38.860,0:17:41.660
You shouldn't talk about it in public.

0:17:43.480,0:17:48.540
The white ones are called the spring snow,
and the golden ones are the dragon cloud.

0:17:48.540,0:17:52.100
The two snuggling on one stem resembles you and His Majesty.

0:17:52.100,0:17:54.500
Stop it!

0:17:55.000,0:17:57.120
His Majesty the Emperor.

0:17:58.260,0:17:59.960
Peace to Your Majesty.

0:17:59.960,0:18:03.060
What's so funny? Let me hear it.

0:18:03.060,0:18:05.360
â€”Rise.
â€”Thank you, Your Majesty.

0:18:07.060,0:18:09.820
How do you like the flowers?

0:18:11.020,0:18:15.920
They were in full bloom in the garden,
so I had them sent to your palace.

0:18:15.920,0:18:18.840
Thank you very much. They are very nice.

0:18:18.840,0:18:23.340
Your Majesty, My Lady is deeply grateful for
the chrysanthemums. It's her favorite flower.

0:18:26.000,0:18:32.080
That's why you have them on your dress.
But why do you like chrysanthemums?

0:18:33.000,0:18:37.500
They never surrender to the cold winds.

0:18:37.500,0:18:40.580
It's a flower of integrity.

0:18:40.580,0:18:42.560
You are well read.

0:18:42.560,0:18:45.820
I didn't mean to show off.

0:18:50.220,0:18:54.420
Don't worry. Reading is good for you.

0:18:54.420,0:19:01.920
Chrysanthemum is not only known for its perseverance,
but also for its solitude from the competitive spring flowers.

0:19:01.920,0:19:06.660
I like it for its endurance of loneliness.

0:19:06.660,0:19:08.920
Thank you, I learned a lot.

0:19:10.100,0:19:14.840
I will have more chrysanthemums sent to you.

0:19:14.840,0:19:22.240
I heard that the green chrysanthemums 
are in full bloom. You will have all of them.

0:19:22.240,0:19:24.400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

0:19:33.000,0:19:39.100
The name of your chamber sounds like a classroom.

0:19:40.580,0:19:45.760
I will name it Chamber of Chrysanthemums for you.

0:19:50.500,0:19:54.820
I came today to give you a task.

0:19:56.000,0:19:59.900
I want you to learn about housekeeping for the palace.

0:19:59.900,0:20:04.520
It is not an easy job.

0:20:04.520,0:20:07.900
But I know nothing about housekeeping.

0:20:07.900,0:20:10.060
That's why you should learn.

0:20:10.060,0:20:14.700
You are smart and responsible.
I have faith in you.

0:20:14.700,0:20:22.220
Managing the palace is running a household.

0:20:22.220,0:20:26.180
You will get the hang of it after a while.

0:20:26.180,0:20:28.700
Yes, I will do my best.

0:20:30.100,0:20:34.880
That's the spirit! You can do it if you put your heart into it.

0:20:35.920,0:20:45.800
The Empress is not in good health, and
Consort Fleur is not a considerate person.

0:20:47.000,0:20:52.020
I hope one day you can help me manage the harem.

0:20:54.300,0:20:57.720
My Lady, Autumn comes to see you on behalf of the Empress.

0:21:02.160,0:21:04.740
Peace to you, My Lady.

0:21:05.880,0:21:07.840
Please lie down.

0:21:07.840,0:21:11.140
Madam, what brings you here?

0:21:11.140,0:21:17.500
Her Majesty is worried about you.

0:21:17.500,0:21:20.340
Please thank Her Majesty for me.

0:21:20.340,0:21:23.660
You look gaunt and tired.
What did the doctor say?

0:21:24.000,0:21:26.380
My Lady, it's time for medicine.

0:21:47.280,0:21:48.620
Are you all right?

0:21:50.920,0:21:53.900
She is suffering physically and mentally.

0:21:53.900,0:21:58.600
She's recovering slowly taking the medicine three times a day.

0:22:00.400,0:22:05.940
There's no medicine for a mental illness.
Time is the cure.

0:22:07.000,0:22:13.100
Attendant Summer was paralyzed. She cannot walk any more.

0:22:14.000,0:22:17.800
Consort Fleur sent her to the Cold Palace because she's inconvenient.

0:22:17.800,0:22:24.000
It was her fault, but the pity of it is that you are affected.

0:22:25.360,0:22:28.960
It's all right. I can't blame her.

0:22:28.960,0:22:33.580
Of course not, but you have long been bed-ridden.

0:22:33.580,0:22:38.480
Lady Shen took advantage of that and became His Majesty's new favorite.

0:22:38.480,0:22:42.740
I'm happy for her.

0:22:43.380,0:22:47.760
But it's my guilt to make Her Majesty worried about me.

0:22:48.880,0:22:53.600
Please rest, My Lady.
I will come to see you another time.

0:22:54.960,0:22:58.800
Mr. Kang, please walk her out.

0:22:59.980,0:23:02.020
I bid you goodbye.

0:23:08.000,0:23:15.500
Attendant Sourire is a flower on the outside
but a chicken on the inside.

0:23:15.860,0:23:20.760
How could she be fine after seeing all the bloody violence?

0:23:22.280,0:23:27.180
But Companion An wasn't scared to fall ill.
She looks the most effeminate among them.

0:23:27.500,0:23:30.700
Even you submit to Consort Fleur's aggressive demeanor.

0:23:30.700,0:23:36.920
You have to bow to her even if you are a Consort with a prince.

0:23:38.360,0:23:42.560
Are you saying that I'm a coward, too?

0:23:42.560,0:23:46.020
But his Majesty is not fond of the Third Prince.

0:23:46.020,0:23:50.100
Nor does His Majesty like me for my age.
Nor does His Majesty like me for my age.

0:23:50.100,0:23:55.340
I cannot compare to Consort Fleur's youth and beauty,
or her family's prominence.

0:23:55.340,0:23:59.780
You should think about the long term.
The Third Prince is the eldest son of His Majesty.

0:24:00.800,0:24:06.500
His Majesty lost my First Prince,
and Empress PremiÃ¨re's Second Prince.

0:24:06.500,0:24:11.620
He will value you much more than Consort Fleur for the Third Prince.

0:24:13.280,0:24:18.560
I understand, but the Third Prince isn't His Majesty's favorite son.

0:24:18.560,0:24:21.240
It is your job to make him the favorite prince.

0:24:23.400,0:24:27.820
You cannot lose heart as his mother.

0:24:27.820,0:24:33.600
But His Majesty hasn't been visiting us for months.

0:24:37.320,0:24:44.120
Your Highness, the chrysanthemums in the
Imperial Garden are not as beautiful as what we have.

0:24:44.500,0:24:47.680
Flowers are as beautiful as the owner.

0:24:47.680,0:24:51.560
Our flower puts every other palace to shame.

0:24:52.000,0:24:55.060
Watch your honeyed mouth.

0:24:55.500,0:25:01.280
Shame on my mouth, for making Her Highness frown.

0:25:05.640,0:25:10.280
Your Highness, I've never seen green chrysanthemums before!

0:25:10.280,0:25:12.860
They are special indeed.

0:25:12.860,0:25:17.100
They must be in a rush to deliver His Majesty's gifts to Your Highness.

0:25:18.020,0:25:23.700
In that case, we can take a look right here.

0:25:24.000,0:25:26.940
Come over here!

0:25:31.000,0:25:33.840
Peace to Your Highness.

0:25:38.200,0:25:39.900
Your Highness.

0:25:39.900,0:25:44.820
Are my green chrysanthemums too heavy to carry?

0:25:44.820,0:25:49.360
Just leave them there while I take a walk in the garden.

0:25:52.500,0:25:56.680
Your Highness ... the chrysanthemums ...

0:25:56.680,0:25:57.920
What's that?

0:25:57.920,0:26:00.040
They are for Lady Shen.

0:26:05.500,0:26:07.260
Of course.

0:26:07.260,0:26:09.620
Your Highness, please forgive me.

0:26:11.460,0:26:13.580
I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness.

0:26:13.580,0:26:15.080
Slap yourself.

0:26:15.080,0:26:22.300
It was all my fault!

0:26:22.300,0:26:26.060
[Chamber of Chrysanthemums]

0:26:26.500,0:26:29.120
My Lady, do you like the new plaque?

0:26:30.660,0:26:34.000
His Majesty replaced it in no time.
You hold a special place in his heart.

0:26:34.360,0:26:39.040
Do not talk in public like this.

0:26:53.240,0:26:56.560
Move faster! Take out all the chrysanthemums!

0:26:58.000,0:27:01.160
I don't want to see them again in my palace!

0:27:02.540,0:27:04.460
Here's one!

0:27:11.000,0:27:13.400
It is still early. Take your time, My Lady.

0:27:13.400,0:27:18.220
I could finally use my lower limbs.
I'm tired of sitting in a sedan chair [a status symbol].

0:27:20.680,0:27:22.600
What is wrong with you?

0:27:22.600,0:27:25.420
I am so sorry, My Lady.

0:27:25.420,0:27:28.160
It's okay, but we have to go back to get changed.

0:27:28.160,0:27:30.000
Her Majesty is expecting us.

0:27:36.500,0:27:40.020
Oh, Lady Shen remembered to come?

0:27:43.960,0:27:47.740
Your Majesty, I'm sorry for the delay.

0:27:48.000,0:27:52.940
It's okay, everyone makes a mistake sometimes.

0:27:52.940,0:27:55.000
Thank you, You Majesty.

0:27:55.000,0:27:56.220
Have a seat.

0:27:56.220,0:28:00.460
Your Majesty is very kind.

0:28:00.460,0:28:05.000
But your indulgence will spoil Lady Shen.

0:28:05.220,0:28:14.560
Indeed. From now on, can we be excused from
paying respect to Your Majesty for no reason?

0:28:14.560,0:28:18.400
Your Majesty, My Lady was late for a reason.

0:28:18.400,0:28:22.840
A eunuch spattered water on her dress,
so we went back to change it.

0:28:22.840,0:28:28.120
But she was late after all.
She has to take responsibility for it.

0:28:34.080,0:28:41.700
Your Majesty, Lady Shen has always been well-behaved.
Please forgive her this once.

0:28:42.000,0:28:47.580
You are the head of her palace.
You are accountable for her mistake as well.

0:28:50.220,0:28:52.320
Let's leave it as it is.

0:28:52.320,0:28:55.460
What would you suggest?

0:28:58.200,0:29:03.180
The law requires a thirty-time flogging for disrespect to the Empress.

0:29:07.000,0:29:10.040
The penalty can be reduced for a first offence.

0:29:10.040,0:29:14.780
Lady Shen will forfeit her stipend for the next two months.

0:29:16.000,0:29:19.600
The same penalty for Concubine Estime.

0:29:22.940,0:29:25.420
What do you think?

0:29:28.000,0:29:34.080
It was all my fault. Please spare Concubine Estime.

0:29:34.080,0:29:40.240
I agreed that a lenient penalty is enough.

0:29:40.240,0:29:45.560
It is the New Year in two months.
The forfeit will be one month instead.

0:29:48.600,0:29:52.520
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I promise this will not happen again.

0:29:53.000,0:29:54.260
You may rise.

0:29:54.700,0:29:56.160
Yes, Your Majesty.

0:29:56.160,0:29:58.780
You may leave now.

0:30:01.780,0:30:04.860
I bid Your Majesty goodbye.

0:30:11.940,0:30:14.280
I'm leaving as well.

0:30:14.280,0:30:17.740
Actually, you might have overreacted to her.

0:30:17.740,0:30:20.260
How so?

0:30:20.500,0:30:29.080
I see everyone as family.
I never took offence when you were late.

0:30:30.480,0:30:33.840
So you think I was too harsh to her.

0:30:33.840,0:30:38.440
His Majesty knows that you are lenient by nature.

0:30:38.440,0:30:44.000
That is why he selected me to assist in housekeeping.

0:30:45.540,0:30:50.480
I have to be strict to balance with your permissiveness.

0:30:51.440,0:30:56.280
As His Majesty's housekeeper, you have to
make yourself an example to the other concubines.

0:30:57.160,0:31:00.620
I hope you can take the lead in being punctual.

0:31:03.000,0:31:05.160
Of course.

0:31:05.160,0:31:11.200
But His Majesty always tells me to sleep in for a bit.

0:31:11.200,0:31:16.300
I'm afraid I have to obey his wish.

0:31:17.740,0:31:21.840
Certainly, we should always put His Majesty first.

0:31:23.940,0:31:29.020
Thank you for the clarification.
I shall leave now.

0:31:38.500,0:31:40.480
I wish to update Your Majesty on Fuzi's death.

0:31:40.480,0:31:41.500
Yes.

0:31:42.060,0:31:45.800
As suspected, she was deliberately killed.

0:31:45.800,0:31:46.900
How so?

0:31:46.900,0:31:50.900
Bruises were found on her neck and forehead.

0:31:50.900,0:31:57.400
It was reported that Consort Fleur was very displeased
when His Majesty talked to Fuzi the night before.

0:31:58.900,0:32:02.100
She's unscrupulous.

0:32:02.500,0:32:05.760
Report it truthfully to His Majesty.

0:32:15.000,0:32:17.420
I need to see the archive of the Attendance Services.

0:32:17.420,0:32:19.380
It is ready for Your Highness.

0:32:39.000,0:32:41.500
(sneer) Twice for Lady Shen,

0:32:41.500,0:32:43.760
and twice for Lady Fuca.

0:32:43.760,0:32:46.260
That is a lot.

0:32:46.260,0:32:49.060
Not at all compared to Your Highness.

0:32:49.060,0:32:52.420
His Majesty only visited the harem seven times this month.

0:32:52.420,0:32:55.140
I have to do something before it's too late.

0:32:55.140,0:33:01.340
Before they are out of my control.

0:33:03.000,0:33:05.000
His Majesty wants the Manchu concubines
to live in Harmony with us Han concubines.

0:33:06.200,0:33:12.000
Send for Lady Fuca. She has a lesson to learn.

0:33:20.000,0:33:23.000
(Lady Fuca)

0:33:30.000,0:33:37.000
As a Manchu concubine, you must learn to write Mandarin.

0:33:37.180,0:33:41.640
The first thing to do is to prepare the ink.

0:33:42.820,0:33:47.440
It's not an easy task.

0:33:52.520,0:33:55.140
This is for your own good.

0:33:56.000,0:34:01.740
It takes hours to grind ink sticks into ink.

0:34:10.000,0:34:15.500
Rebellions occurred in Qinghai Province,
threatening the stability in the Northwest.

0:34:15.800,0:34:22.620
Zhang Tingyu, what do you think?

0:34:22.620,0:34:28.420
Your Majesty, there is only one candidate I can think of.

0:34:28.420,0:34:29.860
Nian Gengyao.

0:34:29.860,0:34:31.640
Indeed.

0:34:31.640,0:34:35.520
Prince VIII and Prince IX [his brothers] are still a threat to your throne.

0:34:35.520,0:34:40.940
General Nian is the brother of Consort Fleur, and has long been in charge of the military in the western territories.

0:34:40.940,0:34:44.880
He is the best candidate in my opinion.

0:34:44.880,0:34:54.180
He made distinct contributions to my throne,
but his power has been unrestrained in the North-West.

0:34:54.180,0:34:59.880
Yue Zhongqi is a descendant of the great general Yue Fei.

0:34:59.880,0:35:06.240
He won consecutive wars in the North-West.
He is modest and sagacious.

0:35:06.240,0:35:11.740
Very well. I hereby appoint Nian Gengyao as Pacification General-in-Chief,

0:35:11.740,0:35:17.500
and Yue Zhongqi as the Counselor-in-Chief.

0:35:17.500,0:35:20.580
Yes, Your Majesty.

0:35:28.000,0:35:35.000
Your Majesty, Zhou Ninghai brought you pastries on behalf of Consort Fleur.

0:35:35.720,0:35:37.880
Just leave it there.

0:35:39.680,0:35:45.560
(tut) I remember receiving eastern pearls from the North-East.

0:35:45.560,0:35:49.900
You will send her the pearls in person.

0:35:49.900,0:35:56.080
It's a reward for her excellent housekeeping work.

0:36:02.000,0:36:04.980
My Lady, you should sleep early.

0:36:04.980,0:36:07.420
I'm not tired.

0:36:08.900,0:36:11.240
It's good that you can enjoy peace of mind.

0:36:11.240,0:36:19.000
Other than Lady Shen, Attendant Chun, and Companion An,
not even a wild cat would visit our palace.

0:36:21.500,0:36:29.000
The other servants have been slothful.
Even Xiao-Yinzi talked back to me.

0:36:29.420,0:36:34.540
That's not surprising. We cannot force them to work.

0:36:37.980,0:36:42.080
It sounds like someone's crying.

0:36:47.500,0:36:51.620
It must be Xiao-Yunzi. He is on the night shift.

0:36:52.800,0:36:54.220
Let's go check out.

0:37:01.620,0:37:04.700
What is wrong? Why are you crying?

0:37:04.700,0:37:07.640
Please forgive me for disturbing your night.

0:37:10.500,0:37:15.500
It's all right. Everyone has a hard time sometimes.
I wish to know what happened to you.

0:37:15.900,0:37:22.640
My brother has been seriously ill for a month.
I am very worried about him.

0:37:22.640,0:37:29.720
Don't worry, you can take a leave to look after him.

0:37:30.000,0:37:32.700
Thank you so much!

0:37:33.420,0:37:37.240
My Lady, it's cold out here. Let's go inside.

0:37:37.240,0:37:41.000
It's late. You should go sleep.

0:37:46.600,0:37:48.460
Your Majesty has been busy lately.

0:37:48.460,0:37:53.040
Here's bird's nest soup with lotus seeds.
It's an invigorating treat.

0:38:04.100,0:38:06.580
Thank you, it's palatable.

0:38:06.580,0:38:11.000
Jiang Fuhai has reported the update on Fuzi's death.

0:38:11.000,0:38:18.200
It was the result of jealousy.
I hope Your Majesty can enlighten me as to what to do.

0:38:18.600,0:38:23.700
I know she was being jealous, 
but that is understandable in the harem.

0:38:23.740,0:38:35.100
She did it out of her feelings for me.
I cannot punish that. You should act as a peacemaker.

0:38:38.000,0:38:46.320
Bird's nest soup is a good treat in the winter.
You should have some as well.

0:38:46.320,0:38:50.300
Thank you, Your Majesty.
[He needs to use Consort Fleur to control her brother's power.]

0:38:50.880,0:38:55.940
Is Attendant Sourire feeling better?

0:38:55.940,0:39:04.200
Mr. Wen is taking good care of her,
but it takes time for her to recover.

0:39:04.200,0:39:11.160
Curing a disease is like reeling cocoons into silk.
A full recovery is not a fast one.

0:39:11.160,0:39:15.720
In that case, she should take it slow.

0:39:17.500,0:39:21.860
Enough with your downcast heads.

0:39:21.860,0:39:27.600
Shifu [how apprentices address their master],
Attendant Sourire is hopeless.

0:39:27.600,0:39:31.460
It's a dead-end job to work for her.

0:39:31.460,0:39:34.220
Don't even get me started.

0:39:34.220,0:39:42.200
Xiao-Youzi used to be nothing in the palace,
but now he is my equal since Lady Fuca became important.

0:39:42.200,0:39:47.300
That bastard wasn't even worthy to carry shoes for me! (spit)

0:39:48.540,0:39:53.620
It's all her fault! She's been sick for two months.

0:39:53.620,0:39:58.800
The doctor said the other day that her situation would last long.

0:39:58.800,0:40:00.820
Could it be phthisis [tuberculosis (TB)]? 

0:40:00.820,0:40:01.940
Nonsense!

0:40:03.180,0:40:10.000
It will be too late to win His Majesty's affections even when she recovers. We will have to live in the very bottom of the palace.

This palace is cursed.

0:40:14.440,0:40:19.860
It was the ruin of Lady Parfum, and soon Attendant Sourire.

0:40:19.860,0:40:23.840
No, this mustn't be our tomb.

0:40:25.040,0:40:27.240
Shifu, we will follow your advice.

0:40:27.240,0:40:29.400
My advice is that we work smart.

0:40:29.400,0:40:33.260
Shifu, you are on shift today.

0:40:33.260,0:40:37.700
Huh, she's ill and inactive. Why bother to make the effort?

0:40:39.300,0:40:44.260
But it's time that we consider working for someone else.

0:40:50.620,0:40:53.600
My Lady wanted to have some tea. Why is it taking so long?

0:40:53.600,0:40:58.300
I have to to boil water before making tea.
I'm afraid she has to wait.

0:40:58.720,0:41:05.640
Besides, the Household Department did not allot tea to her for this month. She will only have hot water later.

0:41:05.640,0:41:10.020
I saw you having tea yesterday.
How could there not be any tea for My Lady?

0:41:10.020,0:41:12.580
Did you take her tea for yourself?

0:41:12.580,0:41:17.740
You have to provide evidence when you say something like that.
You are not living at home any more.

0:41:20.000,0:41:26.840
Violet, is that how you should speak to My Lady's dowry maid?

0:41:26.840,0:41:31.300
You should make tea quickly when My Lady requests.
Go get tea from the Household Department later.

0:41:38.720,0:41:42.480
Attendant Sourire is not likely to recover.

0:41:42.480,0:41:46.640
Shifu, please let me follow you to work for Concubine BeautÃ©.

0:41:49.000,0:41:55.660
Mr. Kang, you should inform My Lady if you are leaving,
so we can congratulate you on your new job.

0:41:56.920,0:42:01.960
I will tell her soon or later. Let's go see her now.

0:42:09.000,0:42:11.000
My Lady.

0:42:12.800,0:42:17.320
My Lady, I'm afraid I cannot serve you any more.

0:42:17.320,0:42:20.660


0:42:20.660,0:42:23.000
What's wrong? Calm yourself down.

I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.

0:42:59.000,0:43:19.000
He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.

0:43:19.000,0:43:36.000
Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.

0:43:36.000,0:43:54.000
I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.

0:43:54.000,0:44:02.000
My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.

0:44:02.000,0:44:16.000
My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.

0:44:16.000,0:44:33.000
A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.

0:44:33.000,0:44:43.000
You can hear the flapping of a phoenix
but you will never see it.

0:44:43.000,0:44:49.000
What you see is the falling leaves from the phoenix tree.

0:44:51.000,0:45:04.000
The falling leaves from the phoenix tree.
