00:00:02.320,00:00:03.680,绝大多数的中国人,,,
00:00:03.680,00:00:06.080,当时生活在贫困线,00:00:02.240,00:00:05.940,The vast majority of Chinese was living under the poverty line.
00:00:06.520,00:00:07.840,一辆汽车,,,
00:00:07.840,00:00:10.440,一架飞机都造不出来,00:00:06.780,00:00:10.340,We could not even make one car or one airplane.
00:00:11.680,00:00:14.960,中国今天的力已经覆盖全世界,00:00:11.780,00:00:15.120,"Today, China’s interests encompass the entire world."
00:00:15.600,00:00:17.720,你还不敢站出来捍卫自己的利益,00:00:15.560,00:00:19.700,"If you dare not stand up and defend your own interests, who will stand up for you?"
00:00:17.720,00:00:19.240,谁来捍卫你的,,,
00:00:21.320,00:00:23.320,这就是中国,00:00:21.440,00:00:24.980,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:00:23.440,00:00:25.320,请张维为说,,,
00:00:26.920,00:00:29.000,我随便最左的最右,,,
00:00:29.000,00:00:30.320,我们都可以沟通,00:00:27.220,00:00:30.900,"I'm open to anything. From the left to the right,
we are open to all communication."
00:00:30.920,00:00:32.360,民主自由,,,
00:00:32.440,00:00:33.040,人权,,,
00:00:33.760,00:00:35.320,所谓媒体控制,00:00:31.660,00:00:37.060,"""Democracy"", ""freedom"", ""human rights"",
the so-called ""media control"", ""Internet control"" ..."
00:00:35.840,00:00:37.760,互联网管控都可以,,,
00:00:37.920,00:00:38.600,的,00:00:37.240,00:00:39.660,We can talk about all these. Why not?
00:00:41.600,00:00:42.560,我是学政治学,,,
00:00:42.600,00:00:43.000,的,,,
00:00:43.480,00:00:44.720,我是研究政策,,,
00:00:45.320,00:00:47.840,后来又直接给中国最高领导者,00:00:41.840,00:00:48.120,I studied politics before I became the translator of our national leaders.
00:00:47.840,00:00:48.480,翻译,,,
00:00:48.960,00:00:51.040,我老说谈任何问题,,,
00:00:51.080,00:00:52.000,问题,,,
00:00:52.040,00:00:53.400,研究要经得起,00:00:49.220,00:00:55.300,"I always say, when you talk about any problems,
your research must stand up to being questioned."
00:00:53.920,00:00:54.960,你叫他去,,,
00:00:58.320,00:00:59.520,特别明显的一个感觉,,,
00:01:00.320,00:01:01.400,我们对外的,00:00:58.620,00:01:03.920,"I distinctly feel that our attitude towards
the outside world is much stronger."
00:01:01.440,00:01:04.080,一个态度要强势很多,,,
00:01:04.800,00:01:07.120,他在用很温和的方式,00:01:04.720,00:01:09.480,He expresses his views in a very gentle and rational way.
00:01:07.120,00:01:08.080,理性的方式,,,
00:01:08.120,00:01:09.840,在表达他的观点,,,
00:01:09.960,00:01:11.360,他的人我看也是这样,,,
00:01:11.360,00:01:12.960,我觉得这一点特别棒,00:01:10.080,00:01:13.340,"I think this is also true for him as a person, which makes him awesome."
00:01:14.280,00:01:15.440,那次了吧,,,
00:01:22.600,00:01:23.720,您这个书,,,
00:01:23.800,00:01:25.320,一边走一边写,00:01:22.740,00:01:26.380,Did you write this book and make notes as you travelled?
00:01:25.360,00:01:25.920,一边在,,,
00:01:26.320,00:01:28.440,我是有记日记的习惯的,00:01:26.640,00:01:28.600,I had the habit of keeping a diary.
00:01:28.480,00:01:30.760,后来我做博士论文的时候,00:01:28.760,00:01:31.040,"Later, when I was doing my doctoral dissertation,"
00:01:30.880,00:01:31.960,结果就在回顾,,,
00:01:31.960,00:01:32.960,当时在中国,,,
00:01:32.960,00:01:35.120,我们中国领导人跟外宾谈,00:01:31.040,00:01:35.860,"I reviewed the discussions on ""Reform and Opening""
between Chinese leaders and foreign guests."
00:01:35.120,00:01:36.080,改革开放,,,
00:01:36.080,00:01:39.760,所以就形成对现在叫中国道路上,00:01:36.440,00:01:39.880,"That was when I developed my own thoughts about
what we call ""the China Path"" today,"
00:01:39.760,00:01:42.440,就中国自己仅靠做法的事情,00:01:39.880,00:01:42.960,which is a series of practices of China.
00:01:48.880,00:01:50.560,我看到清凌站在这里,00:01:48.980,00:01:51.500,I see Qinglin has been standing there for a while.
00:01:50.600,00:01:53.680,这个就是我们第1集,,,
00:01:54.120,00:01:56.160,之前我们开的编前会的内容,00:01:51.520,00:01:56.500,This is what we discussed about Episode 1 in the production meeting.
00:01:56.160,00:01:56.880,现在,,,
00:01:57.120,00:01:58.240,是策划组的变迁,,,
00:01:58.360,00:01:59.880,是,00:01:57.300,00:01:59.740,The production meeting of the pre-production team?
00:02:00.040,00:02:00.360,对,00:01:59.740,00:02:00.620,Yes.
00:02:00.640,00:02:01.560,就拍这个片子,,,
00:02:01.560,00:02:02.200,对,00:02:00.620,00:02:03.520,"- Oh, you made it into a video?
- We did."
00:02:03.880,00:02:04.600,红玲,,,
00:02:04.600,00:02:05.800,呵呵,,,
00:02:06.080,00:02:06.960,他们都是您,,,
00:02:07.000,00:02:08.160,的老公学生,00:02:06.080,00:02:09.140,"- Are they all your students?
- They are."
00:02:08.480,00:02:09.960,您都给他们讲过,,,
00:02:10.000,00:02:10.920,课,00:02:09.220,00:02:11.400,"- You gave lectures to all of them?
-  I did."
00:02:11.120,00:02:12.920,只要孟晚舟这个事情出了以后,,,
00:02:13.120,00:02:14.680,就是各种声音分析评论,00:02:11.800,00:02:14.540,I heard all kinds of opinions on Meng Wanzhou's incident.
00:02:14.680,00:02:15.360,都有的时候,,,
00:02:15.400,00:02:16.440,就按照每家法律,00:02:14.720,00:02:17.620,"Some said that she should comply with US law,"
00:02:16.600,00:02:17.880,包括华为自己都说了,,,
00:02:17.880,00:02:20.000,相信每家的法律会给他公正,00:02:17.620,00:02:20.460,"and Huawei also said they believed that US
and Canadian laws would make an impartial judgement."
00:02:20.000,00:02:21.640,但是你要看外交部的发生,00:02:20.460,00:02:21.960,"But if you look at the announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"
00:02:21.640,00:02:23.320,实际上这4个字立即放任,00:02:21.960,00:02:23.380,"it says ""release Ms. Meng Wanzhou immediately""."
00:02:23.360,00:02:24.800,他这个是加拿大本身,,,
00:02:24.800,00:02:26.640,是不是一个主要角色了,00:02:23.400,00:02:26.660,"In this incident, Canada itself is not the major player."
00:02:26.840,00:02:27.960,后面背后谁指使,00:02:26.660,00:02:28.640,We all understand who is behind this.
00:02:28.000,00:02:28.760,其实大家都明白,,,
00:02:28.760,00:02:30.280,是一个5G的问题,00:02:28.640,00:02:30.420,This is about 5G.
00:02:30.320,00:02:33.080,你即便为了打倒5G的巨人,00:02:30.420,00:02:35.020,"Even if they did this to defeat the 5G giant,
they have taken the stupidest approach."
00:02:33.120,00:02:34.600,也是用了一个最蠢的一个,,,
00:02:34.640,00:02:34.840,话,,,
00:02:34.880,00:02:35.600,比如说我自己,,,
00:02:35.600,00:02:36.720,我就特别受不了,00:02:35.100,00:02:38.140,"Personally speaking, I can't stand it when some professors say,"
00:02:37.080,00:02:37.760,有些教授说,,,
00:02:38.520,00:02:42.040,我们现在得先屈服投降,00:02:38.140,00:02:44.340,"""Oh, we must surrender now. Some core technologies
are not necessary for every country to have."""
00:02:42.320,00:02:43.040,有些核心技术,,,
00:02:43.080,00:02:44.480,不是每个国家必须掌握的,,,
00:02:44.520,00:02:45.840,我先把枪交出来,00:02:44.560,00:02:46.180,"It's like ""Oh, lay down our arms."""
00:02:45.880,00:02:47.720,谁告诉你交强不差,00:02:46.180,00:02:48.220,Who told you they won't kill when you lay down your arms?
00:02:47.760,00:02:48.160,要不在,,,
00:02:48.200,00:02:50.040,腰枪嘴干的是误杀,00:02:48.220,00:02:51.300,"Putting down the arms is your own choice, but killing is their decision."
00:02:50.040,00:02:51.240,是对面决定的事,,,
00:02:51.280,00:02:51.840,交枪不杀,,,
00:02:51.880,00:02:52.800,只有八路军做得到,00:02:51.300,00:02:53.580,Only the Eighth Route Army would let the surrenders live.
00:02:52.880,00:02:55.200,对你交枪他该杀,00:02:53.900,00:02:55.860,"Yeah, if they want to kill you, they will kill regardless."
00:02:55.320,00:02:57.080,还是有啥他优待俘虏,00:02:55.860,00:02:57.460,Only we treat the captives kindly.
00:02:57.160,00:02:58.440,他可能这几十年来,,,
00:02:58.800,00:03:00.960,都是相信着仰望着西方,00:02:57.460,00:03:00.920,"For decades, some may have been
faithful to and looking up to the West,"
00:03:01.000,00:03:03.800,或者仰望着彼岸的世界,00:03:00.920,00:03:05.180,"or ""the perfect world on the other shore"",
and been feeling happy about it."
00:03:03.840,00:03:04.280,然后觉得,,,
00:03:04.320,00:03:05.160,非常好,,,
00:03:05.200,00:03:05.400,对,,,
00:03:05.440,00:03:07.720,突然一下发现事实不是这样的,00:03:05.220,00:03:08.740,"Then all of a sudden, they found out that this wasn't the case anymore, which was beyond their acceptance."
00:03:07.720,00:03:09.000,他就逃避回去,,,
00:03:09.000,00:03:09.840,觉得不能接受,,,
00:03:10.040,00:03:11.320,显示觉得你们都是错,00:03:08.740,00:03:11.280,They fled away with the thought that you were all wrong.
00:03:11.360,00:03:13.240,你之所以三番五次能看到这些人,00:03:11.280,00:03:13.555,"When you repeatedly see these professors' articles,"
00:03:13.400,00:03:13.560,教授,,,
00:03:13.600,00:03:14.560,说明我们相当自信,,,
00:03:14.560,00:03:16.800,不怕舆论来迷惑老百姓,00:03:13.560,00:03:16.760,"it shows that we are very confident, not afraid of
them misleading the public opinion."
00:03:16.960,00:03:19.280,中美贸易的摩擦已经一年了,00:03:16.760,00:03:19.375,China-U.S. trade frictions have lasted for a year.
00:03:19.320,00:03:20.640,一开始就心里,,,
00:03:20.640,00:03:22.720,其实是特别不确定的,00:03:19.380,00:03:22.240,"At first, everyone felt very uncertain."
00:03:22.720,00:03:25.400,这次中国老百姓到政府,00:03:22.480,00:03:26.900,"This time, from Chinese people to the government and to Huawei,"
00:03:25.400,00:03:26.880,到华为自己的反应,,,
00:03:26.880,00:03:27.640,觉得,,,
00:03:27.760,00:03:28.840,一方面是提高了,00:03:26.900,00:03:30.660,all their reactions greatly raised national pride.
00:03:28.840,00:03:31.240,很大的一个民族自豪感,,,
00:03:31.280,00:03:34.920,原来华为已经活成了,00:03:31.680,00:03:36.360,"It turns out that Huawei has become the ""fear"" of another country."
00:03:34.920,00:03:36.560,让你害怕的样子了吗,,,
00:03:36.720,00:03:37.480,把这个问题讲清楚,,,
00:03:37.480,00:03:38.120,特别有必要,00:03:36.680,00:03:38.680,It is particularly necessary to make sense of what happened
00:03:38.120,00:03:39.800,因为一直有人在说,,,
00:03:39.800,00:03:41.640,中国其实应该继续隐藏自己的,00:03:38.680,00:03:43.055,"because some people have been saying that
China should continue to ""hide its light""."
00:03:41.640,00:03:42.120,锋芒,,,
00:03:42.160,00:03:44.000,但是我觉得已经到了,,,
00:03:44.000,00:03:46.440,你没有办法去避锋芒,00:03:43.060,00:03:46.400,"But I feel that there is no way we can avoid ""showing the light""."
00:03:46.480,00:03:47.440,你都站在那了,00:03:46.400,00:03:48.440,How can you hide when you are already standing right there?
00:03:47.440,00:03:48.120,我怎么藏,,,
00:03:48.160,00:03:49.240,就像一个房间里的,00:03:48.540,00:03:50.020,"It's like ""an elephant in the room""."
00:03:49.560,00:03:50.240,不要这么激动,,,
00:03:50.280,00:03:50.600,不要这么,00:03:50.020,00:03:51.060,Don't get so excited.
00:03:51.680,00:03:52.240,他不是,,,
00:03:52.240,00:03:53.240,关键是房间里,00:03:51.060,00:03:54.900,"It's not ... The problem is not like ""an elephant in the room""."
00:03:53.240,00:03:54.120,大象的问题,,,
00:03:54.120,00:03:56.120,就是说其实很多的事情,,,
00:03:56.120,00:03:57.640,它有很多种处理方式,00:03:54.980,00:03:57.680,"In fact, a problem can be handled in many different ways."
00:03:57.920,00:03:59.000,我变强以后,,,
00:03:59.000,00:04:01.520,我可以和拉着你一块,00:03:58.080,00:04:02.440,"After I get strong, we can join hands and go together ..."
00:04:01.560,00:04:02.280,咱们一块走,,,
00:04:02.280,00:04:04.240,共同走向更高的富裕,,,
00:04:04.240,00:04:04.760,这个阶段,00:04:02.440,00:04:06.260,"towards a higher stage of affluence.
For example, a win-win alliance, is one way."
00:04:04.760,00:04:05.600,比如说强强联合,,,
00:04:05.600,00:04:06.640,这是一种方式,,,
00:04:06.680,00:04:08.720,而且我们这么一路走过来,00:04:06.620,00:04:09.480,And we have come all the way with our win-win alliances.
00:04:08.760,00:04:10.040,是共赢过来的,,,
00:04:10.040,00:04:11.360,就是张老师说,00:04:09.800,00:04:11.460,"Like Professor Zhang said,"
00:04:11.360,00:04:13.320,我们为什么真的相信,00:04:11.460,00:04:15.300,"the reason why we really believe in ""win-win"", not just preaching it,"
00:04:13.480,00:04:15.520,是不是去宣扬,,,
00:04:15.520,00:04:17.160,是我们真的相信能共赢,00:04:15.300,00:04:17.400,"is that we are able to offer ""win-win"" solutions."
00:04:17.200,00:04:17.720,但是我觉得,,,
00:04:17.720,00:04:19.720,张老师可能还得说清楚,00:04:17.400,00:04:21.520,"But I think Prof. Zhang will have to make it clear
where the solution is to this problem."
00:04:19.720,00:04:21.320,这个问题的解放在,,,
00:04:22.200,00:04:23.200,所以清明最后,,,
00:04:23.200,00:04:24.760,其实还是带着了一个疑问,00:04:22.180,00:04:24.680,"So, Qinglin had a question for you in the end."
,,,00:04:24.680,00:04:25.760,I did.
00:04:25.640,00:04:27.560,是我回答这个问题,00:04:25.760,00:04:27.760,I will answer that. (laughs)

learn about China, understand China, and position China!"
00:05:02.120,00:05:03.200,理解中国,,,
00:05:03.240,00:05:04.560,定位中国,,,
00:05:04.640,00:05:05.680,站在我身边的,,,
00:05:05.720,00:05:07.040,就是我们的主将嘉宾,00:05:04.860,00:05:07.740,"Standing next to me is our keynote speaker,"
00:05:07.080,00:05:08.120,他是复旦大学,,,
00:05:08.160,00:05:09.520,中国学院的院长,00:05:07.740,00:05:10.160,"Professor Zhang Weiwei, Director of the China Institute of Fudan University."
00:05:09.520,00:05:10.320,张维为教授,,,
00:05:10.320,00:05:11.120,欢迎,00:05:10.160,00:05:11.160,Welcome!
00:05:11.120,00:05:12.240,谢谢,00:05:11.160,00:05:12.360,Thank you!
00:05:14.240,00:05:15.080,在改革开放,,,
00:05:15.120,00:05:17.200,望之初张教授是担任过,00:05:14.200,00:05:16.180,"At the beginning of Reform and Opening [1980s],"
00:05:17.200,00:05:19.000,党和国家领导人的翻译,00:05:16.180,00:05:21.460,"Professor Zhang served as a translator for party and
national leaders, including Comrade Deng Xiaoping."
00:05:19.080,00:05:21.600,其中就包括邓小平同志,,,
00:05:21.640,00:05:23.000,他本人也走访过,,,
00:05:23.000,00:05:23.640,世界上的,00:05:21.460,00:05:24.980,"Professor Zhang also visited more than 100
countries and regions in the world."
00:05:23.640,00:05:25.040,100多个国家和地区,,,
00:05:25.040,00:05:26.960,对中国的发展世界的发展,,,
00:05:26.960,00:05:29.120,可以说有着深刻的观察,00:05:25.220,00:05:29.080,"He arguably has a profound observation of
the development of China and the world."
00:05:29.480,00:05:32.320,我真的觉得通过横向的比较,00:05:29.660,00:05:34.960,"I really think that horizontal comparison will help us
understand China and the world."
00:05:32.520,00:05:34.040,有助于我们读懂中国,,,
00:05:34.040,00:05:34.960,读懂世界,,,
00:05:34.960,00:05:35.440,是,00:05:35.220,00:05:36.180,I agree.
00:05:35.480,00:05:37.160,我们现场还有很多年轻人,,,
00:05:37.160,00:05:38.040,我们的年轻朋友,00:05:36.180,00:05:39.640,"There are many young people in the audience today,
and our young friends came with their own questions."
00:05:38.040,00:05:39.720,都是带着问题来的,,,
00:05:39.720,00:05:40.680,我特别期待,,,
00:05:40.680,00:05:42.800,今天这样一个对话的过程,00:05:39.640,00:05:42.740,I particularly look forward to having a dialog with them today.
00:05:42.840,00:05:44.720,之前咱俩已经看了一段视频,,,
00:05:44.840,00:05:46.280,这个视频是策划组,00:05:42.740,00:05:47.720,"Professor Zhang and I have watched a video
reporting the work status of pre-production team."
00:05:46.280,00:05:47.600,他们的一个工作的状况,,,
00:05:47.600,00:05:50.560,他们也是常年从事时政报道的,00:05:47.720,00:05:51.100,"The pre-production team is made up of media
professional who are engaged in reporting current affairs."
00:05:50.560,00:05:51.040,媒体人,,,
00:05:51.080,00:05:51.720,对中国问题,,,
00:05:51.760,00:05:53.720,也有自己的观察和思考,00:05:51.100,00:05:53.960,They have their own observations and reflections on China as well.
00:05:53.960,00:05:55.080,接下来的时间,,,
00:05:55.280,00:05:56.720,我就要把舞台让给,00:05:53.960,00:05:57.195,"Now, I will give the stage to Professor Zhang."
00:05:56.760,00:05:58.400,张教授让我们进入,,,
00:05:58.400,00:06:00.480,这就是中国的第1集的话题,00:05:57.200,00:06:02.120,We will get into the first topic of China Now together!
00:06:00.520,00:06:02.680,一起来定位中国,,,
00:06:02.880,00:06:03.520,行,00:06:02.720,00:06:03.880,Welcome.
00:06:03.960,00:06:04.440,谢谢,00:06:03.880,00:06:05.880,Thank you.
00:06:07.520,00:06:08.920,待会我们到互动的时候,,,
00:06:08.920,00:06:10.800,大家什么问题都可以提,00:06:07.380,00:06:11.220,"When we get to the Q&A segment,
you can ask me any questions."
00:06:11.080,00:06:12.000,英文叫note,,,
00:06:12.000,00:06:14.120,不没有任何进取问题,00:06:11.220,00:06:13.780,"There are no restricted zones, or ""no taboo"" in English."
00:06:14.120,00:06:16.040,越尖锐越好,00:06:13.780,00:06:16.180,The questions can be as pointed as you want.
00:06:17.360,00:06:21.880,刚才我们看到一个视频讨论,00:06:16.760,00:06:24.120,In the video we saw some meaningful questions were raised.
00:06:22.040,00:06:24.360,提出了很有意义的问题,,,
00:06:25.280,00:06:28.800,一个就是我们一直讲合作共赢,00:06:25.480,00:06:28.660,"One question is ""win-win cooperation"", which we always talk about."
00:06:28.800,00:06:29.760,但是这个路,,,
00:06:29.760,00:06:32.120,究竟能不能继续走下去,00:06:28.920,00:06:32.120,Can we continue to go down that road?
00:06:32.680,00:06:35.440,另外就是美国究竟是出于什么,,,
00:06:35.440,00:06:36.160,目的,,,
00:06:36.640,00:06:38.480,要对我们华为公司,00:06:32.500,00:06:41.960,"Another question is, what was the purpose of
America taking a hostage from Huawei?"
00:06:38.720,00:06:41.920,采用这种绑票的手段,,,
00:06:41.920,00:06:43.920,特别是到目前为止,,,
00:06:43.920,00:06:45.720,没有任何证据,00:06:42.680,00:06:45.660,There hasn't been any evidence [against Huawei] so far .
00:06:46.120,00:06:47.360,有时候有坏事情,,,
00:06:48.120,00:06:48.880,某种意义上,00:06:46.420,00:06:50.680,Sometimes a bad thing can turn out to be good in a sense.
00:06:48.880,00:06:50.600,可能变成好事情的,,,
00:06:51.160,00:06:52.480,我们可以回顾一下,,,
00:06:52.480,00:06:53.880,在座大部分年轻人,,,
00:06:54.040,00:06:55.800,可能有些还能记得,,,
00:06:56.320,00:06:57.560,93年的时候,00:06:50.940,00:07:01.540,"Most of the young people here can still recall
Yinhe incident in 1993 while some may not remember it."
00:06:57.560,00:06:59.360,有一个银河号事件,,,
00:06:59.360,00:07:01.000,大家有的不一定记得,,,
00:07:01.640,00:07:03.720,99年一个轰炸南斯拉夫使馆,00:07:01.700,00:07:04.935,"There were the United States bombing
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999,"
00:07:03.720,00:07:04.480,事件,,,
00:07:04.880,00:07:07.480,01年有个南海撞机事件,00:07:04.935,00:07:07.925,"a China-US aircraft collision in the South China Sea in 2001,"
00:07:07.520,00:07:10.360,08年有个奥运火炬传递的事件,00:07:07.925,00:07:11.880,"attacks during Beijing Olympics torch relay in Paris in 2008,"
00:07:10.360,00:07:11.760,在巴黎是吧,,,
00:07:11.880,00:07:15.720,还有今年绑架华为高管的事件,00:07:11.880,00:07:15.680,"and this year, abduction of a Huawei executive."
00:07:15.960,00:07:17.000,我觉得这实际上,,,
00:07:17.000,00:07:20.200,是唤醒了越来越多的中国人,00:07:16.920,00:07:20.200,"I think these incidents are awakening more and more Chinese people,"
00:07:20.600,00:07:21.600,甚至我想说是,,,
00:07:21.600,00:07:24.120,我们整个民族信,00:07:20.420,00:07:26.000,"and I would even say they are a kind of ""coming-of-age
ceremony"" for the overall revival of our entire nation."
00:07:24.120,00:07:26.440,全面崛起一种成人礼,,,
00:07:26.600,00:07:27.600,因为这么多年来,,,
00:07:27.640,00:07:28.880,我们其实有不少人,,,
00:07:28.880,00:07:30.920,特别是我们知识界的一些人,00:07:26.720,00:07:33.380,"Because over the years, many of us, especially some
intellectuals, have acted very naively."
00:07:31.080,00:07:32.560,表现的十分的幼稚,,,
00:07:33.440,00:07:36.640,总觉得有个无比美好的彼岸世界,,,
00:07:36.640,00:07:37.600,也就是西方,00:07:34.320,00:07:39.020,"They always felt there was an extremely beautiful world
on the other side - the West, America in particular."
00:07:37.600,00:07:38.880,特别是美国,,,
00:07:39.280,00:07:40.320,结果突然发现,,,
00:07:40.520,00:07:42.680,彼岸世界是虚构出来的,00:07:39.100,00:07:42.140,"But it turns out that this ""perfect world"" is fictional."
00:07:42.920,00:07:44.360,一个孟晚舟事件,,,
00:07:44.360,00:07:47.600,实际上暴露了美国太多的虚伪,00:07:42.920,00:07:48.740,"In fact, the Meng Wanzhou incident exposed
too much hypocrisy and hegemony of America."
00:07:47.600,00:07:49.160,太多的霸道,,,
00:07:49.400,00:07:50.800,说好的市场经济,,,
00:07:50.800,00:07:51.640,公平竞争,00:07:49.280,00:07:52.740,"What happened to the promised market economy,
fair competition, and free trade?"
00:07:51.640,00:07:52.640,自由贸易,,,
00:07:53.360,00:07:54.760,说好的契约精神,00:07:53.580,00:07:55.140,Where is their spirit of contract?
00:07:55.000,00:07:56.800,说好的民主人权,00:07:55.140,00:07:57.440,What about democracy and human rights?
00:07:57.440,00:07:58.680,统统泡汤了,00:07:57.580,00:07:59.080,All gone.
00:07:59.360,00:08:00.040,我们可以看到,,,
00:08:00.080,00:08:03.160,华为在世界竞争最激烈的五级,00:07:59.480,00:08:03.420,"We can see that in the world's most competitive 5G race,"
00:08:03.160,00:08:03.920,领域,,,
00:08:03.960,00:08:05.520,在核心技术领域,,,
00:08:05.520,00:08:07.640,在确立中国标准方面,00:08:03.760,00:08:07.680,"in terms of the core technologies and the establishment of standards,"
00:08:07.760,00:08:10.400,实际上已经赶上了我们的对手,00:08:07.680,00:08:13.340,"Huawei has actually caught up with their competitors,
and even surpassed their competitors in many aspects."
00:08:10.640,00:08:11.840,甚至在不少方面,,,
00:08:11.840,00:08:13.320,超越了我们的对手,,,
00:08:13.320,00:08:15.120,这使他们感到害怕了,00:08:13.620,00:08:15.520,"This made them afraid,"
00:08:15.720,00:08:16.800,这种恐惧,,,
00:08:16.800,00:08:18.160,使他们采取了,00:08:15.520,00:08:20.680,and in fear they resorted to restricting competition by foul play.
00:08:18.160,00:08:19.400,我叫做下三滥的,,,
00:08:19.400,00:08:21.080,这种绑票的手段,,,
00:08:21.960,00:08:24.280,好在中国已经崛起,00:08:22.220,00:08:24.220,"Fortunately, China has risen."
00:08:25.080,00:08:26.000,我真的认为,,,
00:08:26.000,00:08:26.800,我们的领导人,,,
00:08:26.800,00:08:28.840,都是经历过文革乱世的,00:08:24.780,00:08:30.320,"Our leaders went through the chaos in the
Cultural Revolution; I also experienced part of it."
00:08:28.840,00:08:30.320,我也经历过一部分,,,
00:08:30.480,00:08:32.400,我们知道怎么对付流氓,00:08:30.680,00:08:33.120,We know how to deal with rogues.
00:08:33.680,00:08:36.400,这个事件最终会得到解决,00:08:33.520,00:08:36.640,"I believe that this incident will eventually be resolved
under the strong pressure from the Chinese people."
00:08:36.520,00:08:38.400,中国也会更快的走到,,,
00:08:38.400,00:08:39.560,世界政治,00:08:36.640,00:08:40.960,"China will also move faster to the center of
the world's political and economic arena."
00:08:39.600,00:08:41.520,和经济舞台的中央,,,
00:08:41.760,00:08:44.560,邓小平当年讲韬光养晦的时候,,,
00:08:44.600,00:08:47.960,中国的经济规模比俄罗斯还小,00:08:41.880,00:08:47.920,"When Deng Xiaoping talked about ""hiding our light"",
China's economy was smaller than Russia's."
00:08:48.480,00:08:51.160,但今天俄罗斯的经济规模,00:08:48.240,00:08:53.540,"But today, Russia's economy is about the size of our Guangdong Province."
00:08:51.280,00:08:54.200,大约是我们的一个广东省的规模,,,
00:08:54.720,00:08:55.600,换句话说,,,
00:08:55.600,00:08:58.400,你已经长成了姚明的个子,00:08:54.840,00:09:01.100,"In other words, we have grown into Yao Ming [7' 6""].
Can we still want to hide behind Pan Changjiang [5' 3""]?"
00:08:59.200,00:09:01.360,你还想躲在潘长江后面,,,
00:09:02.440,00:09:04.520,实际上这是很难得,00:09:02.280,00:09:03.620,That is very difficult.
00:09:07.240,00:09:09.280,而且即使在三十年前,,,
00:09:09.280,00:09:11.920,在邓小平讲韬光养晦的时候,00:09:07.320,00:09:11.680,"Even 30 years ago, when Deng Xiaoping
talked about keeping a low profile,"
00:09:12.200,00:09:13.560,他也非常明确,,,
00:09:13.560,00:09:14.440,韬光养晦,,,
00:09:14.440,00:09:16.480,只是手段不是目的,00:09:12.340,00:09:18.780,"he was very clear that keeping a low profile was just
a means to end, and the end is to make a difference."
00:09:16.600,00:09:18.880,目的是有所作为,,,
00:09:19.320,00:09:20.520,因为中国今天的力,,,
00:09:20.520,00:09:22.920,已经覆盖全世界了,00:09:19.360,00:09:23.080,"Because today, China's interests encompass the entire world."
00:09:23.400,00:09:25.560,你还不敢站出来捍卫自己的利益,00:09:23.400,00:09:26.700,"If you dare not stand up and defend your own interests,
who will stand up for you?"
00:09:25.560,00:09:27.440,谁来捍卫你的利益,,,
00:09:28.160,00:09:30.240,至于后边你们还提到一个问题,,,
00:09:30.240,00:09:30.440,是,00:09:28.280,00:09:32.300,Moving on to the question of whether cooperation and win-win is possible.
00:09:30.440,00:09:32.320,究竟能不能合作共赢,,,
00:09:32.920,00:09:34.040,那么我是,,,
00:09:34.080,00:09:34.240,的,,,
00:09:34.640,00:09:36.360,我们中国人才一路走来,00:09:33.100,00:09:38.100,"We, the Chinese people, have come all along with true faith in it."
00:09:36.400,00:09:38.320,中国人真的相信这个东西,,,
00:09:38.600,00:09:41.120,但现在麻烦是有一个主要的国家,00:09:39.020,00:09:42.920,"But now the problem is that there is a
leading country that still doesn't believe it."
00:09:42.040,00:09:42.560,还不信,,,
00:09:42.600,00:09:45.200,他只相信老子天下第一,00:09:42.920,00:09:45.140,It only believes that its own interest comes first in the world
00:09:45.200,00:09:47.000,只相信零和游戏,00:09:45.140,00:09:49.020,"and only believes in zero-sum games,
in which only one part can win."
00:09:47.360,00:09:49.080,我赢输你赢我输,,,
00:09:49.880,00:09:51.920,中国人是下围棋的,,,
00:09:52.080,00:09:53.560,围棋讲究是,00:09:49.540,00:09:56.340,"The Chinese people play Go, a game
to form ""potential"" with strength."
00:09:53.800,00:09:55.880,用这实力来形成,,,
00:09:55.880,00:09:56.840,一种是,,,
00:09:57.240,00:09:58.600,中国现在比方说,,,
00:09:58.640,00:10:00.360,已经是130多个国家的,00:09:56.980,00:10:01.320,China is now the largest trading partner of more than 130 countries.
00:10:00.360,00:10:01.560,最大的贸易伙伴,,,
00:10:01.560,00:10:03.080,这就是实力,,,
00:10:03.080,00:10:03.320,这,00:10:01.800,00:10:04.620,This is our strength and our potential.
00:10:04.520,00:10:06.480,只相信老子天下第一的,00:10:04.620,00:10:07.300,"If a country believes that only itself can take first place in the world,"
00:10:06.800,00:10:08.000,我想这样的国家,,,
00:10:08.000,00:10:09.920,在大势所趋面前,00:10:07.300,00:10:12.220,I think it's necessary for such a country to adapt to the general trend
00:10:09.920,00:10:11.760,他肯定也不得不做调整,,,
00:10:12.000,00:10:14.680,走到合作共赢的大路上,00:10:12.220,00:10:14.680,and come to the road of win-win cooperation.
00:10:14.680,00:10:16.040,我想这是我的一个,,,
00:10:16.040,00:10:19.320,对你们前面一些问题的思考,00:10:14.680,00:10:19.000,These are my thoughts on some of your previous questions.
00:10:20.040,00:10:22.400,另外现在我们回头想一想,00:10:20.280,00:10:23.820,"Now when we look back at the past 70 years,"
00:10:22.400,00:10:23.640,过去这七十年,,,
00:10:23.640,00:10:24.240,四九年,,,
00:10:24.240,00:10:26.120,人民共和国成立到今年,00:10:23.820,00:10:26.460,"from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,"
00:10:26.560,00:10:28.280,真是很不容易的,00:10:26.680,00:10:28.400,it has been very difficult.
00:10:28.280,00:10:29.720,因为我们四九年,,,
00:10:29.720,00:10:30.960,刚刚建国,00:10:28.400,00:10:32.260,"In 1949, our newly founded republic was caught up with the Korean War."
00:10:31.320,00:10:32.440,就赶上了,,,
00:10:32.600,00:10:33.520,朝鲜战争,,,
00:10:33.520,00:10:35.840,美国人是打到了我们的家门口,00:10:32.700,00:10:38.200,"When Americans hit the doorstep of the Chinese people,
we had no choice but to rise up and fight."
00:10:36.200,00:10:38.520,中国人不得不奋起反抗,,,
00:10:38.840,00:10:41.200,那么毛主席说是打得一拳开,00:10:39.080,00:10:42.920,"Chairman Mao said, ""One strong punch
will save a hundred more."""
00:10:41.200,00:10:42.400,免得百拳来,,,
00:10:43.440,00:10:46.000,抗美援朝实际上是一仗定乾坤,00:10:43.480,00:10:46.820,"The Korean War was a battle to establish our international position,"
00:10:46.560,00:10:47.640,换来了之后,,,
00:10:47.640,00:10:50.000,到今天的60多年的和平,00:10:46.820,00:10:49.740,an exchange for the peace of more than 60 years to this day.
00:10:50.160,00:10:52.440,否则不可能有今天这么顺利的,00:10:50.100,00:10:53.200,"Otherwise, there would not have been such a smooth rise for China."
00:10:52.440,00:10:53.360,崛起,,,
00:10:53.840,00:10:55.440,那么我们人民共和国,,,
00:10:55.440,00:10:57.760,成立之初的落后状况,00:10:53.720,00:11:00.500,"The backwardness at the beginning of our republic
is unimaginable for the young people today."
00:10:57.760,00:11:00.840,是大家今天的年轻人难以想象的,,,
00:11:01.280,00:11:02.080,因为我们经历了,,,
00:11:02.080,00:11:05.360,长达百年的动乱战乱,00:11:01.420,00:11:05.320,"After going through over a century of turmoil and wars,"
00:11:05.720,00:11:07.200,中国由原来世界上,,,
00:11:07.240,00:11:08.720,最复苏的一个国家,,,
00:11:08.720,00:11:10.360,或者国家之一,00:11:05.620,00:11:12.440,"China became ""poor and blank"" from
one of the richest countries in the world."
00:11:10.360,00:11:12.720,陷入了一穷二白的境地,,,
00:11:13.240,00:11:16.160,当时毛主席有过这么一段话,00:11:13.240,00:11:17.120,Chairman Mao had a paragraph describing China at that time.
00:11:16.160,00:11:18.280,描述那个时候的中国,,,
00:11:18.280,00:11:20.480,他说现在我们能造什么呢,00:11:17.220,00:11:20.340,"He said, ""What can we make now?"""
00:11:20.600,00:11:22.520,能造桌子椅子,,,
00:11:22.520,00:11:23.720,能造茶碗,,,
00:11:23.720,00:11:24.840,能造茶壶,,,
00:11:24.840,00:11:26.120,还能种粮食,00:11:20.640,00:11:29.560,"""We can make tables, chairs, tea bowls, teapots, grains, flour, and paper."""
00:11:26.120,00:11:27.440,还能磨成面粉,,,
00:11:27.480,00:11:28.600,还能造纸,,,
00:11:28.960,00:11:32.840,但是一辆汽车一架飞机,,,
00:11:33.160,00:11:34.320,一辆坦克,00:11:30.240,00:11:36.500,"""But we cannot even make one car, one airplane, one tank, or one tractor."""
00:11:34.320,00:11:36.360,一辆拖拉机都造不出来,,,
00:11:36.360,00:11:39.000,这就当时中国得真实的状况,00:11:36.800,00:11:39.640,This was the real situation of China at that time.
00:11:40.160,00:11:41.640,那么随后我们开始,,,
00:11:41.680,00:11:42.080,就是,,,
00:11:42.120,00:11:44.440,以工业建设为特征的,00:11:39.980,00:11:45.520,"After that we began a national rejuvenation
characterized by industrial construction,"
00:11:44.440,00:11:45.920,民族复兴,,,
00:11:46.320,00:11:47.600,但这个过程,,,
00:11:47.600,00:11:50.360,确实不是那么的一帆风顺,00:11:46.380,00:11:50.040,but this process was not smooth.
00:11:50.680,00:11:52.480,我们回头看前30年,00:11:50.580,00:11:52.740,"When we look back at the past thirty years,"
00:11:52.480,00:11:55.280,从1949年到1978年,00:11:52.740,00:11:55.160,"from 1949 to Reform and Opening in 1978,"
00:11:55.280,00:11:56.640,到改革开放前,,,
00:11:56.840,00:11:59.280,我们确定了优先发展工业,00:11:55.500,00:12:00.460,"we determined to give priority to industrial development, especially heavy industry."
00:11:59.400,00:12:01.120,特别是发展重工业,,,
00:12:01.160,00:12:02.680,特别经历过朝鲜战争,,,
00:12:02.680,00:12:03.800,你没有钢铁,00:12:01.400,00:12:05.500,We learnt from the Korean War that we would be bullied without steel.
00:12:03.840,00:12:04.960,就被人家欺负,,,
00:12:05.040,00:12:05.640,对不对,,,
00:12:06.400,00:12:07.720,同时我们在社会事业上,,,
00:12:07.720,00:12:09.120,我们也做了很多的事情,00:12:06.500,00:12:09.500,Meanwhile we also did a lot in social undertakings
00:12:09.120,00:12:10.680,包括妇女解放,,,
00:12:10.680,00:12:12.080,土地改革,,,
00:12:12.080,00:12:13.600,教育的普及,00:12:09.500,00:12:15.100,"such as women's liberation, land reform,
universal education, universal medical care and so on."
00:12:13.640,00:12:15.520,基础医疗的普及等等,,,
00:12:15.960,00:12:19.000,我们完成了基本政治制度的建设,00:12:15.880,00:12:18.920,We constructed the basic political system
00:12:19.000,00:12:22.040,我们完成了比较完整的工业体系,00:12:19.000,00:12:24.460,"and formed a relatively complete industrial system,
national defense system and technology system."
00:12:22.240,00:12:24.240,国防体系和科技体系,,,
00:12:24.280,00:12:25.440,先回头看,,,
00:12:25.440,00:12:27.120,这些基础是不得了的,00:12:24.700,00:12:29.920,"Looking back, these laid crucial foundations for China's rise."
00:12:27.800,00:12:30.320,对我们后来的崛起至关重要,,,
00:12:30.520,00:12:32.240,所以在这个基础上,,,
00:12:32.240,00:12:33.680,我们的前三十年,00:12:30.340,00:12:36.240,"""At thirty, I had planted my feet firm upon the ground."" [by Confucius]"
00:12:33.680,00:12:36.440,应该说实现了三十而立,,,
00:12:36.960,00:12:38.560,为后40年,00:12:37.120,00:12:39.920,The achievement we attained in the first 30 years was the basis
00:12:38.680,00:12:40.000,改革开放国家崛起,,,
00:12:40.000,00:12:41.360,奠定了基础,00:12:39.920,00:12:41.860,"of the Reform and Opening and
the rise of our country in the following 40 years."
00:12:41.840,00:12:44.640,但我们确实付出了很沉重的代价,00:12:41.860,00:12:46.960,But we paid a heavy price for the detour we took in political revolution.
00:12:44.760,00:12:45.480,那么政治上,,,
00:12:45.480,00:12:47.280,我们走过一些弯路,,,
00:12:47.480,00:12:49.320,我们民生的欠账,,,
00:12:49.320,00:12:51.360,老百姓生活的欠账太多,00:12:47.520,00:12:53.680,"We owed a lot to people's livelihoods and
their living standards remained very low."
00:12:51.720,00:12:54.360,我们人民的生活水平还相当低,,,
00:12:54.440,00:12:56.280,按照当时的国际标准,00:12:54.300,00:12:57.880,The majority Chinese people were struggling around the poverty threshold
00:12:56.320,00:12:57.680,绝大多数的中国人,,,
00:12:57.680,00:12:59.120,当时七八年时候,,,
00:12:59.120,00:13:01.520,生活在贫困县,00:12:57.980,00:13:01.460,according to the international standard in 1978.
00:13:01.880,00:13:02.600,那么,,,
00:13:02.640,00:13:05.360,如果你用人均GDP比较的话,00:13:01.800,00:13:04.860,"In the measurement of GDP per capita,"
00:13:05.360,00:13:07.320,当时中国的人均GDP,00:13:04.860,00:13:09.760,"China's per capita GDP at that time was
lower than most African countries."
00:13:07.320,00:13:10.000,低于绝大多数的非洲国家,,,
00:13:10.560,00:13:14.000,上海当时是中国最发达的地区之,00:13:10.520,00:13:14.280,"Shanghai was one of China's most prosperous cities,"
00:13:14.000,00:13:14.600,一,,,
00:13:14.840,00:13:16.120,但是多数家庭的,,,
00:13:16.120,00:13:18.200,人均居住面积是4平米,00:13:15.040,00:13:18.860,"but the living area per capita of most
families was under 4 square meters."
00:13:19.200,00:13:20.560,我是1983年,,,
00:13:20.560,00:13:23.440,第1次去泰国首都曼谷的,00:13:19.100,00:13:23.120,"I went to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand
in 1983 for the first time."
00:13:23.800,00:13:25.040,我觉得他领先上海,,,
00:13:25.040,00:13:25.880,至少二十年,00:13:23.640,00:13:26.560,I believe it was at least 20 years ahead of Shanghai.
00:13:25.880,00:13:26.960,当时的感觉,,,
00:13:27.840,00:13:29.280,我甚至八八四年,,,
00:13:29.280,00:13:30.920,八五年去过非洲,,,
00:13:31.080,00:13:32.960,我们去过津巴布韦的首都,00:13:27.940,00:13:34.520,"Even when I went to Africa in 1984 and 1985, to the
capital of Zimbabwe and the capital of Côte d'Ivoire,"
00:13:33.000,00:13:34.640,和科特迪瓦的首都,,,
00:13:34.640,00:13:36.040,我都感觉首都,,,
00:13:36.640,00:13:38.080,比当时的北京要,00:13:34.560,00:13:38.460,I believe these two cities were more developed than Beijing.
00:13:38.120,00:13:39.080,打来,,,
00:13:39.240,00:13:40.960,当时的真实的感觉,00:13:39.000,00:13:41.000,That was how I truly felt.
00:13:40.960,00:13:42.840,改革开放这四十年,,,
00:13:42.840,00:13:45.880,我可以说是四十而不惑,00:13:41.180,00:13:45.500,"Over the forty years of Reform and Opening,
we have found our own way of success,"
00:13:46.040,00:13:48.640,我们找到了自己的成功道路,00:13:45.500,00:13:48.480,"which could be described as ""At forty,
we no longer suffered from perplexities"" [by Confucius]."
00:13:48.680,00:13:51.360,所以我们迎来了,,,
00:13:51.360,00:13:52.640,也就习近平主席说的,,,
00:13:52.680,00:13:55.760,中华民族从站起来到富起来,00:13:49.060,00:13:58.800,"As President Xi said, ""We took a giant leap from
standing up, to getting rich, and to getting strong""."
00:13:55.800,00:13:56.720,到强起来,,,
00:13:56.760,00:13:59.000,这么一个伟大的飞跃,,,
00:13:59.320,00:14:01.400,那么我自己走了100多个国家,00:13:59.400,00:14:01.220,I have been to more than one hundred countries
00:14:01.440,00:14:05.120,我是比较喜欢把中国的崛起,00:14:01.600,00:14:07.120,and I like to compare China's rise with other countries.
00:14:05.120,00:14:07.200,跟世界各国进行比较,,,
00:14:07.280,00:14:09.560,我可以把世界国家分成三大类,00:14:07.500,00:14:09.620,I divided all the countries into three groups –
00:14:09.760,00:14:11.480,第1类是发展中国家,00:14:09.980,00:14:11.280,"developing countries,"
00:14:11.560,00:14:14.160,第2类是转型经济国家,00:14:11.760,00:14:13.960,"countries in economic transition,"
00:14:14.160,00:14:15.800,第3类是西方国家,00:14:14.480,00:14:15.860,and western countries.
00:14:15.800,00:14:17.960,然后做一个比较,,,
00:14:17.960,00:14:19.720,我们可以更理解,,,
00:14:19.720,00:14:20.920,什么叫中国道路,00:14:16.100,00:14:23.460,"This comparison will allow us to better understand the China Path, the China Mode and China's rise."
00:14:20.920,00:14:22.120,什么叫中国模式,,,
00:14:22.120,00:14:23.680,什么叫中国崛起,,,
00:14:23.880,00:14:26.840,首先我们看发展中国家,00:14:23.460,00:14:25.400,I will begin with developing countries.
00:14:26.840,00:14:28.640,毫无疑问的问题是什么,00:14:25.940,00:14:28.820,What's the biggest challenge in developing countries?
00:14:29.000,00:14:30.040,最大的挑战,,,
00:14:30.080,00:14:30.360,都是,,,
00:14:30.360,00:14:32.120,如何解决贫困问题,00:14:29.040,00:14:31.700,"Without a doubt, it is to fight poverty,"
00:14:32.520,00:14:33.920,那么中国这方面做的,00:14:32.060,00:14:35.460,and China is the most successful developing country in this sense.
00:14:33.920,00:14:35.880,是世界上最成功的,,,
00:14:35.920,00:14:37.560,按照我们自己的标准,00:14:35.880,00:14:37.340,"According to our own standard,"
00:14:37.600,00:14:38.760,四十年间,,,
00:14:38.800,00:14:42.360,我们是七亿四千万人口脱贫,00:14:37.640,00:14:42.000,740 million Chinese people were lifted out of poverty in the past forty years.
00:14:42.720,00:14:45.040,如果是用世界银行的标准,00:14:42.720,00:14:47.300,"The number will change to 850 million
by the World Bank's standard."
00:14:45.040,00:14:47.520,是8亿5000万人口脱贫,,,
00:14:47.680,00:14:48.240,也就是说,,,
00:14:48.240,00:14:49.120,世界上,,,
00:14:49.120,00:14:51.200,将近百分之八十的贫困,00:14:47.820,00:14:52.480,It means nearly eighty percent of global poverty was eliminated by China.
00:14:51.240,00:14:52.680,是在中国消除的,,,
00:14:52.960,00:14:53.600,那么有人说,,,
00:14:53.600,00:14:55.360,我们现在贫富差距还很大,00:14:53.020,00:14:55.520,Some may say China now faces a huge wealth gap.
00:14:56.560,00:14:57.640,我也承认,00:14:56.240,00:14:57.260,"I agree,"
00:14:58.320,00:15:00.760,但是我觉得还是要在国际比较中,00:14:57.600,00:15:02.820,but we need to put this into perspective through comparison with other countries.
00:15:00.760,00:15:02.960,把这个问题看清楚,,,
00:15:02.960,00:15:05.080,我经常讲过这么一个观点,00:15:03.400,00:15:04.960,"I have said this a lot,"
00:15:05.120,00:15:08.040,我说你把中国和其他发展中国家,00:15:05.220,00:15:08.460,"when you compare China with other developing countries,"
00:15:08.040,00:15:08.880,比较,,,
00:15:09.000,00:15:10.520,我说你可以从北京,,,
00:15:10.560,00:15:12.680,从上海开车,00:15:08.780,00:15:14.120,"you can drive twenty hours from Beijing or Shanghai,"
00:15:12.840,00:15:14.360,开20个小时,,,
00:15:14.480,00:15:16.680,你可以开到黑龙江漠河,,,
00:15:16.680,00:15:17.640,开到海南岛,00:15:14.360,00:15:19.160,"to Mohe in Heilongjiang, or to Hainan, or Guangzhou, or Chongqing,"
00:15:17.640,00:15:18.440,开到广州,,,
00:15:18.480,00:15:19.720,开到重庆,,,
00:15:19.760,00:15:21.120,只要你不开到海里去,00:15:19.340,00:15:21.340,as long as you don't drive into the sea.
00:15:22.400,00:15:24.120,你把你一路看到的贫困,00:15:22.480,00:15:25.500,"If you record the poverty you see,"
00:15:24.120,00:15:25.400,全都记录下来,,,
00:15:25.440,00:15:27.880,会少于你在印度这样的,,,
00:15:27.880,00:15:29.880,典型的发展中国家,00:15:25.860,00:15:31.780,it would be less than what you see in a two-hour drive in a typical developing country like India.
00:15:29.920,00:15:31.920,两个小时看到的贫困,,,
00:15:32.040,00:15:33.680,这不能比他们贫困,00:15:32.080,00:15:34.500,Their situation is much worse than ours.
00:15:33.680,00:15:34.600,比我们多得多,,,
00:15:34.600,00:15:35.720,而且是持平,00:15:34.500,00:15:35.960,They have people in absolute poverty.
00:15:36.200,00:15:36.640,那么,,,
00:15:36.840,00:15:38.800,我们因为是社会主义国家,00:15:36.320,00:15:38.680,"Because we are a socialist country,"
00:15:38.800,00:15:40.680,我们进行过土地改革,,,
00:15:40.680,00:15:43.280,我们的农民有地有房子,00:15:38.960,00:15:43.260,and our farmers own land and houses after the land reform.
00:15:43.320,00:15:45.280,这就完全不一样了,00:15:43.260,00:15:45.100,Things are completely different here.
00:15:45.520,00:15:47.760,我有一个很好的印度尼西亚朋友,00:15:45.380,00:15:49.580,"I have a good friend from Indonesia
 who studies [community] development."
00:15:47.800,00:15:49.560,做发展问题研究的,,,
00:15:49.560,00:15:51.520,他说中国的东道主要老说,00:15:49.660,00:15:51.660,"His Chinese hosts kept telling him,"
00:15:51.560,00:15:53.400,你不要光看北京上海,00:15:51.660,00:15:53.260,"""You shouldn't only focus on Beijing and Shanghai."
00:15:53.480,00:15:54.840,你要到我们的贫困地区,00:15:53.460,00:15:56.240,"You should go to the poverty-stricken places such as Guizhou Province""."
00:15:54.880,00:15:56.360,到我们贵州去看看,,,
00:15:56.960,00:15:57.640,他自己一个人,,,
00:15:57.680,00:15:58.240,真的去了一次,00:15:56.600,00:15:58.740,"So, he really went to Guizhou himself"
00:15:58.240,00:15:58.960,贵州,,,
00:15:59.240,00:16:01.320,说的还是跟我们的不一样,00:15:58.900,00:16:00.900,and found that the poverty was different from Indonesia-
00:16:01.360,00:16:04.280,说你们贵州也比我们发达很多,00:16:01.500,00:16:04.500,Guizhou was much more developed.
00:16:04.760,00:16:07.320,那么比方说他去了贫困家庭,00:16:04.980,00:16:07.260,"For example, he visited a poor family."
00:16:07.320,00:16:09.840,他说你们贫困户有房子,00:16:07.680,00:16:10.040,"They had a house, farmland,"
00:16:09.840,00:16:10.760,有地,,,
00:16:11.120,00:16:12.400,有饭有菜,00:16:10.180,00:16:13.980,and the families in poverty he visited had three dishes and a soup for a meal.
00:16:12.400,00:16:13.160,三个菜,,,
00:16:13.200,00:16:14.080,一个汤,,,
00:16:14.200,00:16:16.080,他说我们贫困人口是没有地,00:16:14.200,00:16:16.471,He said poor people in Indonesia didn't have a house.
00:16:16.080,00:16:16.720,没有房子,,,
00:16:16.720,00:16:18.440,吃得非常差吃不饱,00:16:16.480,00:16:18.400,Their food was awful and insufficient.
00:16:18.640,00:16:19.760,所以我们是解决了,,,
00:16:19.760,00:16:21.480,温饱问题之后的,00:16:18.680,00:16:22.660,So our poverty excludes the basic living needs.
00:16:21.480,00:16:22.560,这种贫困问题,,,
00:16:22.560,00:16:24.800,我记得当时我人还在欧洲,00:16:22.920,00:16:26.200,"I remember when I was in Europe in 2010,"
00:16:24.840,00:16:26.240,2010年的时候,,,
00:16:26.280,00:16:27.920,在甘肃舟曲,,,
00:16:27.920,00:16:30.960,发生过一个泥石流的灾难,00:16:26.600,00:16:32.200,"a debris flow struck Zhouqu, Gansu Province."
00:16:31.240,00:16:32.360,自然灾害,,,
00:16:32.520,00:16:33.600,我当时我就注意到,,,
00:16:33.600,00:16:35.000,一个很有意思现象,00:16:32.560,00:16:35.020,What drew my attention was that
00:16:35.000,00:16:35.800,就倒下来的,,,
00:16:35.840,00:16:37.440,很多房子里边,00:16:35.240,00:16:38.760,many of the fallen houses were equipped with air conditioners.
00:16:37.440,00:16:38.640,都是有空调的,,,
00:16:39.400,00:16:41.280,因为我走了这么多发展中国家,00:16:39.320,00:16:40.900,"For all the developing countries I visited,"
00:16:41.280,00:16:43.800,我知道空调对发展中国家很奢侈,00:16:41.180,00:16:43.900,air conditioner was a luxury.
00:16:43.800,00:16:46.240,因为首先你的市政电力,00:16:44.220,00:16:46.960,"First of all, the municipal electricity supply must be able to meet the demand,"
00:16:46.240,00:16:48.680,是保证向印度保证不了空调的,00:16:47.100,00:16:49.860,which was impossible in a country like India.
00:16:48.680,00:16:49.400,用电的,,,
00:16:50.240,00:16:51.480,但是中国在甘肃,,,
00:16:51.480,00:16:53.000,在舟曲这样地方,00:16:49.880,00:16:55.640,"But in a city of China like Zhouqu, air conditioner had been popularized in 2010."
00:16:53.160,00:16:54.440,2010年的时候,,,
00:16:54.480,00:16:55.920,空调已经普及了,,,
00:16:56.120,00:16:57.840,所以我是实事求是,,,
00:16:58.120,00:17:01.240,我相信我们可以高标准严要求,00:16:56.020,00:17:02.840,I believe we need higher standards and stricter requirements on our work.
00:17:01.280,00:17:02.840,把我们工作做得更好,,,
00:17:02.840,00:17:03.840,这是对的,,,
00:17:04.120,00:17:05.600,但是不管怎么样,,,
00:17:05.600,00:17:07.160,以我自己走了这么多,00:17:04.220,00:17:09.980,"However, comparing with the countries that I have been to,"
00:17:07.160,00:17:10.120,发展中国家的实事求是比较,,,
00:17:10.200,00:17:10.760,我们实际上,,,
00:17:10.760,00:17:11.440,比他们做的,,,
00:17:11.480,00:17:12.760,已经好了很多了,00:17:10.200,00:17:12.960,we have actually done a much better job.
00:17:13.680,00:17:16.080,我们的贫困人口的生活水平,,,
00:17:16.080,00:17:18.920,比40年前也提高了很多,00:17:13.840,00:17:18.880,The living standard of people in poverty has also improved a lot than forty years ago.
00:17:19.160,00:17:21.560,按照我们现在的贫困标准,00:17:19.200,00:17:21.200,"According to our poverty standard now,"
00:17:21.560,00:17:24.000,到今年还有三千万左右的贫困,00:17:21.560,00:17:24.580,there are about thirty million people in poverty as of this year.
00:17:24.000,00:17:24.800,人口,,,
00:17:24.840,00:17:26.840,我们现在需要在两年之内,,,
00:17:26.840,00:17:28.120,到2020年,00:17:24.840,00:17:30.600,"By the end of 2020, we are going to pull these people out of poverty"
00:17:28.640,00:17:30.840,把这些人口也都全部脱贫,,,
00:17:30.840,00:17:32.280,彻底的消除,00:17:30.740,00:17:33.560,and completely eliminate extreme poverty.
00:17:32.360,00:17:33.680,极端的贫困,,,
00:17:33.880,00:17:38.000,我想中国消除贫困的奇迹,00:17:33.900,00:17:37.800,I think the miracle of eliminating extreme poverty made by China
00:17:38.120,00:17:39.600,应该是会载入,,,
00:17:39.600,00:17:42.040,人类文明发展的史册的,00:17:37.900,00:17:41.820,will be recorded on the history of human civilization.
00:17:46.520,00:17:49.440,那么第二和转型经济国家比较,00:17:46.680,00:17:49.440,"Secondly, we compare China with countries in economic transition."
00:17:49.440,00:17:50.240,实际上这个概念,,,
00:17:50.280,00:17:51.240,我是不太喜欢,00:17:49.500,00:17:51.240,This is a concept I don't prefer.
00:17:51.240,00:17:53.240,他指的是社会主义国家,00:17:51.420,00:17:54.420,It refers to socialist countries and former socialist countries
00:17:53.240,00:17:54.560,前社会主义国家,,,
00:17:54.600,00:17:56.320,从计划经济转向市场经济,00:17:54.460,00:17:57.560,"transitioning from planned economy to market economy, a definition made by the World Bank."
00:17:56.320,00:17:57.760,世界银行的概念,,,
00:17:57.920,00:17:59.280,但一时我还没有找到,,,
00:17:59.320,00:17:59.760,一个,00:17:57.720,00:18:01.400,"But at the moment, I haven't found a better expression of the idea."
00:17:59.760,00:18:01.360,更好的表述方法,,,
00:18:01.400,00:18:03.400,所以姑且用之,00:18:01.460,00:18:03.580,"So, I will go with this definition."
00:18:04.160,00:18:05.840,那么和这些国家比较,,,
00:18:06.400,00:18:08.800,也是令人感概万千,00:18:04.060,00:18:08.520,It makes me sigh comparing with these countries.
00:18:08.960,00:18:11.640,那么我记得当时二十七八年前,00:18:08.780,00:18:14.280,"I remember when the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe collapsed about 27 years ago,"
00:18:11.640,00:18:12.880,苏联崩溃,,,
00:18:12.920,00:18:14.200,东欧崩溃的时候,,,
00:18:14.200,00:18:16.000,西方是一片叫好,00:18:14.280,00:18:15.900,"the west was cheering,"
00:18:16.280,00:18:17.680,伟大的西方民主模式,,,
00:18:17.680,00:18:19.400,降临到了铁木国家,00:18:16.280,00:18:19.180,"""The great western democracy has arrived in the Iron Curtain."""
00:18:20.200,00:18:21.640,当时他们都是觉得,,,
00:18:21.680,00:18:23.720,他们东欧,00:18:20.220,00:18:25.640,They thought Eastern Europe and Soviet Union
00:18:23.760,00:18:24.480,俄罗斯,,,
00:18:25.080,00:18:25.920,前苏联,,,
00:18:26.240,00:18:27.800,他们是迎来一个,,,
00:18:27.840,00:18:29.880,灿烂的辉煌的前途,00:18:26.000,00:18:29.720,was heading towards a bright future.
00:18:29.960,00:18:31.440,但是这么多年过去了,,,
00:18:31.440,00:18:34.000,我们可以比较转型,00:18:30.000,00:18:36.180,"But years later, we can compare China with these countries in economic transition."
00:18:34.000,00:18:37.960,经济国家和中国的表现没法比,00:18:36.180,00:18:38.160,They are incomparable .
00:18:37.960,00:18:38.800,我有时真想说,,,
00:18:38.800,00:18:39.800,一个天一个地,,,
00:18:40.240,00:18:42.120,我们表现远远超过他们,00:18:38.160,00:18:42.040,"Sometimes I say the gap between China and these countries is ""as wide as between heaven and earth"""
00:18:42.440,00:18:44.280,那么在苏联解体时候,00:18:42.260,00:18:44.260,"When the Soviet Union collapsed,"
00:18:44.320,00:18:46.640,俄罗斯经济规模比中国还要大,00:18:44.600,00:18:47.540,Russia's economy was larger than China.
00:18:46.640,00:18:47.880,我刚才提到了,,,
00:18:48.080,00:18:49.280,现在是大有等于,,,
00:18:49.320,00:18:51.320,我们广东省的一个规模,00:18:47.720,00:18:51.120,"But like I mentioned, Russia's economy is about the same size as Guangdong Province today."
00:18:52.000,00:18:54.200,我们国家外汇储备,,,
00:18:54.560,00:18:57.120,现在是3万亿多一些美元,00:18:51.960,00:18:57.560,Our national foreign exchange reserve is now more than US$ 3 trillion.
00:18:57.520,00:19:00.160,外汇储备在我80年代,00:18:57.560,00:18:59.140,The number was very small
00:19:00.160,00:19:01.360,给领导人做翻译的时候,00:18:59.140,00:19:02.860,when I was an interpreter for the national leaders in the 1980s.
00:19:01.400,00:19:02.680,我们是非常小的,,,
00:19:03.280,00:19:04.680,几乎是从无到有,,,
00:19:04.680,00:19:05.520,增长出来的,00:19:03.140,00:19:06.620,It is like an economic sector that has grown out of nothing.
00:19:05.520,00:19:06.800,一个新的板块,,,
00:19:06.840,00:19:08.120,光是我们的外汇储备,,,
00:19:08.120,00:19:10.040,今天就超过了,00:19:07.040,00:19:09.400,Our foreign exchange reserves alone exceed
00:19:10.600,00:19:13.520,俄罗斯和整个东欧,00:19:09.400,00:19:15.460,the combined GDP of Russia and the whole of Eastern and Central Europe today.
00:19:13.520,00:19:15.720,中欧的GDP的总和,,,
00:19:16.840,00:19:18.800,这就是翻天覆地的变化,00:19:15.720,00:19:18.400,This enormous change indicates in a way
00:19:18.840,00:19:20.440,也从一个角度说明,,,
00:19:20.440,00:19:21.400,我们的模式,00:19:18.400,00:19:23.780,that our model is more successful than theirs.
00:19:21.440,00:19:23.920,相对要成功得多,,,
00:19:23.960,00:19:26.200,另外和西方国家比较,00:19:23.800,00:19:25.800,The last comparison is between China and western countries.
00:19:26.440,00:19:27.480,那么我们,,,
00:19:27.520,00:19:28.760,国内确实还有一些人,00:19:26.340,00:19:31.080,There are still some people in China kowtowing to the United States.
00:19:28.880,00:19:31.160,一切是以美国为马首是瞻,,,
00:19:31.160,00:19:34.200,那么我就把中国和美国比较一下,00:19:31.600,00:19:34.300,"So, let's compare China with America."
00:19:35.120,00:19:36.680,比方说人均寿命,00:19:34.400,00:19:36.540,"Taking average life expectancy as an example here,"
00:19:36.680,00:19:38.560,上海比纽约要高4岁,,,
00:19:38.560,00:19:40.240,I纽约是79岁,00:19:36.740,00:19:41.720,"the average life expectancy of Shanghai is 83 years, 4 years longer than New York."
00:19:40.240,00:19:41.720,上海是83岁,,,
00:19:42.120,00:19:44.280,我们的婴儿死亡率比纽约低,00:19:41.940,00:19:44.520,Our Infant mortality rate is lower than New York.
00:19:44.280,00:19:45.400,我们的社会治安,,,
00:19:45.440,00:19:47.400,比纽约好10倍都不止,00:19:44.640,00:19:47.540,Our social security level is more than 10 times higher than New York.
00:19:47.440,00:19:49.720,因为我今年10月份还在纽约,00:19:47.680,00:19:49.940,"When I was in New York in October,"
00:19:49.760,00:19:50.680,当时正好赶上,,,
00:19:50.680,00:19:52.760,他们纽约市的市长宣布,00:19:50.100,00:19:53.720,"the mayor of New York City announced,"
00:19:52.760,00:19:54.480,说是告诉你们个好消息,00:19:53.840,00:19:54.900,“Good news!
00:19:54.480,00:19:56.400,我们25年来,00:19:55.000,00:19:57.440,"In the past 25 years, this is the first time"
00:19:56.680,00:19:57.920,第1次,,,
00:19:58.360,00:20:00.800,整整一个周末三天,00:19:57.440,00:20:03.260,we haven’t had a single shooting for three consecutive days over a weekend.”
00:20:00.920,00:20:02.640,没有一期枪击案,,,
00:20:03.480,00:20:04.760,第4天又有了,00:20:03.260,00:20:04.760,That means a shooting happened on the fourth day.
00:20:04.800,00:20:06.960,你就知道它的治安是个什么水平,00:20:04.920,00:20:07.160,You can imagine their social security level.
00:20:07.960,00:20:09.000,那么,00:20:07.400,00:20:10.200,I have always stressed that
00:20:09.040,00:20:10.640,像我是一直讲这么观点,,,
00:20:10.640,00:20:12.000,我说我们是任,,,
00:20:12.040,00:20:13.040,认真学习,00:20:10.380,00:20:14.580,"we should learn from the strengths of all the other countries,"
00:20:13.080,00:20:14.760,窃国家的长处,,,
00:20:14.760,00:20:16.760,包括美国的长处,00:20:14.860,00:20:16.440,"including America,"
00:20:16.880,00:20:18.520,但我们同时脑子也清晰,,,
00:20:18.560,00:20:19.920,我们也看到,00:20:16.640,00:20:22.120,but we must stay clear-headed about the problems of western countries.
00:20:20.080,00:20:20.960,美国的问题,,,
00:20:20.960,00:20:21.880,西方的问题,,,
00:20:21.920,00:20:24.240,所以我们在眼界上,00:20:22.280,00:20:25.840,We have broader horizons than the western countries.
00:20:24.280,00:20:25.640,超越西方模式,,,
00:20:26.440,00:20:28.600,那么我老说中国实际上已经形成,00:20:26.280,00:20:30.300,I often say that China has its own developed regions.
00:20:28.600,00:20:30.520,自己的一个发达板块,,,
00:20:30.800,00:20:32.000,发达板块的人口,,,
00:20:32.000,00:20:33.960,已经超越超过美国了,00:20:30.480,00:20:35.340,"The population in these regions is over 400 million, more than America's population."
00:20:33.960,00:20:35.320,应该4亿多人,,,
00:20:35.840,00:20:37.240,另外我还经常用一个数字,,,
00:20:37.240,00:20:39.400,就比较老百姓的真实家底,00:20:35.860,00:20:43.160,I often use median household net worth as a measure of household wealth.
00:20:39.920,00:20:41.840,我叫做家庭净资产,,,
00:20:42.160,00:20:43.280,中位水平,,,
00:20:43.520,00:20:44.200,我用的是,,,
00:20:44.600,00:20:46.760,2010年的美联储,00:20:43.640,00:20:47.680,According to the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2010
00:20:46.800,00:20:48.320,处发表的调查报告,,,
00:20:48.320,00:20:49.560,和同一年,,,
00:20:49.720,00:20:51.560,我们西南财经大学,00:20:47.880,00:20:51.750,and a study following the same standards in the same year
00:20:51.960,00:20:53.680,也是用美联储同样的标准,00:20:51.750,00:20:55.280,"by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,"
00:20:53.680,00:20:55.440,在中国做的报告,,,
00:20:55.520,00:20:56.320,所以我们可以看到,,,
00:20:56.320,00:20:58.040,在2011年比较,,,
00:20:58.360,00:21:00.320,当时他们报告就发现,,,
00:21:00.600,00:21:02.400,中国的城镇家庭,,,
00:21:02.400,00:21:05.800,和美国的家庭中位水平相比的话,00:20:58.400,00:21:08.620,"China's median urban household net worth is about US$ 10,000 lower than America."
00:21:05.840,00:21:08.360,实际上是D1万美元左右,,,
00:21:09.040,00:21:11.640,"中国是66,300美元",,,
00:21:11.640,00:21:14.240,"美国是77,300美元",00:21:09.120,00:21:14.640,"This number is $ 66,300 for China and $ 77,300 for America,"
00:21:14.880,00:21:16.000,折成今天的人民币,00:21:14.640,00:21:17.200,about more than 500 thousand yuan.
00:21:16.000,00:21:17.080,也就是五十来万,,,
00:21:17.960,00:21:20.640,实际上拿到中国的发达板块,00:21:17.840,00:21:21.067,"But if you compare America to China's developed regions,"
00:21:20.720,00:21:22.960,特别像上海这样地方,,,
00:21:22.960,00:21:24.520,属于弱势群体了,00:21:21.067,00:21:25.100,"America would be a disadvantaged social class in cities like Shanghai,"
00:21:25.280,00:21:27.280,因为你房产都算进去,00:21:25.320,00:21:27.520,because the net worth includes the worth of people's house properties.
00:21:27.520,00:21:28.480,所以这本身,,,
00:21:28.480,00:21:28.760,我觉得,,,
00:21:28.760,00:21:30.600,就是一个翻天覆地的变化,00:21:27.820,00:21:30.400,This is a dramatic change in my opinion.
00:21:30.640,00:21:32.280,四十年前我们想都不敢想,00:21:30.540,00:21:33.471,"We couldn't imagine to be comparable with America forty years ago,"
00:21:32.280,00:21:33.200,怎么和美国比,,,
00:21:33.200,00:21:35.440,现在是我们可以很自信的比一比,00:21:33.480,00:21:35.540,but now we are confident to be their match.
00:21:35.640,00:21:36.680,那么,,,
00:21:36.800,00:21:38.600,讲你刚才比较说,,,
00:21:38.600,00:21:42.120,只是把中国的城镇人口跟美国比,00:21:35.700,00:21:41.900,Some may say that I only compared China's urban population with America's
00:21:42.320,00:21:44.480,没有把农村人口算进去,00:21:41.980,00:21:44.200,and didn't take our rural population into account.
00:21:44.480,00:21:47.120,实际上我是故意这样做的,00:21:44.200,00:21:46.860,"Yes, I did that on purpose."
00:21:47.280,00:21:48.240,这个报告,,,
00:21:48.400,00:21:50.720,他没有把我们农民兄弟,00:21:47.080,00:21:52.340,This report didn't consider the farmers' land
00:21:50.720,00:21:52.600,事实上拥有的土地,,,
00:21:52.720,00:21:53.480,算进去,,,
00:21:53.520,00:21:54.080,我们土地,,,
00:21:54.080,00:21:55.480,农民兄弟是有使用权的,00:21:52.480,00:21:56.540,and they have the right of use and management of their land.
00:21:55.480,00:21:56.640,还有经营权的,,,
00:21:57.200,00:21:58.240,那么,,,
00:21:58.280,00:21:58.920,由于种种原因,00:21:57.020,00:21:59.880,I don't think it's a fair comparison
00:21:58.920,00:21:59.920,他没有算进去,,,
00:21:59.960,00:22:02.560,那么我觉得比较就不太公平,00:21:59.980,00:22:02.540,if it doesn't include the land ownership for various reasons.
00:22:02.720,00:22:05.640,所以我想以后如果这个数字出来,00:22:02.800,00:22:07.700,I think the report should estimate the value of the land even with a hypothetical price.
00:22:05.640,00:22:07.640,哪怕你做个虚拟的土地价,,,
00:22:07.640,00:22:09.320,现在土地价格是很贵的,00:22:07.840,00:22:09.840,"Now land prices are pretty high, aren't they?"
00:22:09.320,00:22:09.920,对不对,,,
00:22:09.920,00:22:10.800,现在农村户口,,,
00:22:10.800,00:22:11.520,你给他上海户口,,,
00:22:11.560,00:22:12.080,他都不要,00:22:09.980,00:22:13.260,"Farmers prefer rural Hukou [household registration] rather than a Shanghai Hukou,"
00:22:12.080,00:22:13.520,我要农村的户口,,,
00:22:13.520,00:22:14.320,上面有很多的,,,
00:22:14.560,00:22:15.200,各种各样的,,,
00:22:15.200,00:22:17.360,实际上是资产积累在这里的,00:22:13.560,00:22:17.500,because so much property accrues to a rural Hukou
00:22:17.760,00:22:19.920,如果讲这样的指标,,,
00:22:20.560,00:22:22.760,说明的是经济上,00:22:17.900,00:22:25.520,"If we believe such indicators show the progress in economy, wealth, and material,"
00:22:22.800,00:22:23.920,财富上,,,
00:22:23.960,00:22:25.680,物质上的进步,,,
00:22:26.400,00:22:28.200,那么我还可以用一些其他指标,00:22:25.720,00:22:30.540,I can also look at other indicators to verify our progress in other aspects.
00:22:28.240,00:22:30.560,来看其它方面的进步,,,
00:22:30.840,00:22:31.520,我经常,,,
00:22:31.560,00:22:32.480,用的就是,00:22:30.840,00:22:33.940,I often refer to American Pew Research Center
00:22:32.520,00:22:33.760,美国皮尤中心,,,
00:22:33.880,00:22:36.240,欧洲的一套skin,00:22:34.080,00:22:37.860,European Ipsos’s polls on China
00:22:36.640,00:22:38.520,他们都在中国,,,
00:22:38.560,00:22:39.520,连续10,,,
00:22:39.560,00:22:40.480,十年甚至更长时间,,,
00:22:40.520,00:22:41.120,时间,00:22:37.860,00:22:44.600,and other major countries for the past 10 years or more.
00:22:41.840,00:22:44.600,在中国和其他主要国家做民调,,,
00:22:44.760,00:22:45.520,我比方说,,,
00:22:45.560,00:22:48.600,我用一艘C16年的民调,00:22:44.880,00:22:50.820,"For example, there was a simple question in the 2016 Ipsos poll:"
00:22:49.600,00:22:50.840,问题非常简单,,,
00:22:50.840,00:22:52.400,就是你的国家,,,
00:22:52.400,00:22:55.120,是否走在正确的道路上,00:22:51.000,00:22:55.060,do you think your country is on the right path?
00:22:55.880,00:22:57.000,中国认为自己国家,,,
00:22:57.000,00:22:58.520,走在正确道路上,00:22:55.720,00:23:00.380,90% of Chinese gave positive answers
00:22:58.520,00:23:00.480,是90%,,,
00:23:00.680,00:23:02.640,法国是11%,00:23:00.520,00:23:02.520,while only 11% of French did so.
00:23:03.120,00:23:04.320,所以我们就可以理解了,,,
00:23:04.320,00:23:07.240,为什么法国现在有黄马甲抗议,00:23:02.980,00:23:08.260,"Thus, we can understand why the ""yellow vest"" protest happened in France."
00:23:07.240,00:23:08.440,运动,,,
00:23:08.960,00:23:10.880,去年11月,,,
00:23:10.920,00:23:14.720,我和法国一位反华的哲学家,00:23:08.700,00:23:17.920,"In November 2017, I debated Bernard-Henri Lévy, an anti-China philosopher in France,"
00:23:15.440,00:23:16.280,叫one,,,
00:23:16.280,00:23:17.680,Not re里,,,
00:23:18.560,00:23:20.200,他批评中国人群,00:23:17.920,00:23:20.140,who criticized human rights in China.
00:23:20.200,00:23:22.160,实际上这个人是一个,,,
00:23:22.840,00:23:26.520,推动法国和西方国家,00:23:20.420,00:23:29.380,"Actually, he is the person who pushed France and western countries to invade Libya by force,"
00:23:26.520,00:23:27.680,用武力,,,
00:23:27.920,00:23:29.120,侵犯利比亚,,,
00:23:29.120,00:23:30.480,要推翻政权,,,
00:23:30.520,00:23:31.160,支持颜色,,,
00:23:31.200,00:23:32.840,革命阿拉伯之春的国家,00:23:29.380,00:23:33.000,"to overthrow governments, and to support color revolutions like the Arab Spring."
00:23:33.720,00:23:35.480,后来我就引用这个数据,00:23:33.520,00:23:36.920,"And I quoted this poll data. I said, look,"
00:23:35.480,00:23:36.800,我说你看看,,,
00:23:37.440,00:23:38.760,只有11%的人认为,,,
00:23:38.760,00:23:40.640,法国走在正确的道路上,00:23:37.300,00:23:40.440,"only 11% of French think France is on the right path,"
00:23:40.640,00:23:42.480,另外百分之八十几的人,00:23:40.640,00:23:43.600,while the other 80% are not satisfied.
00:23:42.840,00:23:44.080,不满意,,,
00:23:44.720,00:23:45.800,你没有考虑过,,,
00:23:45.800,00:23:48.880,这当中多少是人权问题,00:23:43.800,00:23:48.880,Have you ever considered how much of the dissatisfaction resulted from human rights issues?
00:23:49.120,00:23:50.320,我在法国生活过,,,
00:23:50.320,00:23:51.920,法国有很多人权问题,00:23:49.120,00:23:52.860,"I lived in France and I know France has many human rights issues, doesn’t it?"
00:23:51.920,00:23:52.680,对不对,,,
00:23:53.200,00:23:55.680,所以我说马英9N不是你管好,00:23:53.280,00:23:56.560,"So, I said “Mind your own business”."
00:23:55.680,00:23:56.480,自己的事儿,,,
00:24:02.360,00:24:04.960,后来他提到我们的新疆的人群,00:24:02.240,00:24:04.500,Then he mentioned human rights in Xinjiang.
00:24:05.480,00:24:09.000,我说你们把利比亚搞乱,00:24:05.480,00:24:08.900,"I said that you have already messed up Libya,"
00:24:09.640,00:24:11.120,把叙利亚搞乱,00:24:09.840,00:24:11.100,"Syria,"
00:24:12.040,00:24:13.640,把伊拉克搞乱了,00:24:11.360,00:24:13.360,and Iraq.
00:24:14.080,00:24:16.040,还想把新疆搞乱了,00:24:13.600,00:24:15.880,Now you want to mess up Xinjiang as well?
00:24:16.360,00:24:19.720,挪威呵呵绝对不允许的,00:24:16.540,00:24:19.460,No way! We won’t let it happen!
00:24:20.560,00:24:21.560,顺便讲一句,,,
00:24:21.680,00:24:22.120,现在,,,
00:24:22.600,00:24:24.040,中国和世界,00:24:20.540,00:24:26.200,"By the way, China and the world are now connected through globalization."
00:24:24.240,00:24:26.360,通过全球化连成一片了,,,
00:24:26.640,00:24:27.920,你比方要了解,,,
00:24:28.840,00:24:30.440,黄马甲运动在法国,00:24:26.680,00:24:32.780,"For example, if you want to know whether the ""yellow vest"" movement will continue in France and Europe,"
00:24:30.440,00:24:31.120,或者欧洲,,,
00:24:31.160,00:24:32.840,会不会继续发展下去,,,
00:24:32.880,00:24:34.280,你都不用去法国,00:24:32.780,00:24:34.280,you don’t even need to be in France.
00:24:34.280,00:24:35.360,你问一下,,,
00:24:35.400,00:24:37.600,义乌小商品市场,00:24:34.520,00:24:37.560,Just go to Yiwu Small Commodity Market
00:24:37.640,00:24:40.040,他们的马甲卖的好不好,00:24:37.760,00:24:40.100,and ask the vendors about the sales of vests.
00:24:40.040,00:24:41.000,卖得好就挣,,,
00:24:41.000,00:24:43.200,你还要发展下去,00:24:40.180,00:24:42.820,The sales would indicate whether the movement will continue.
00:24:43.360,00:24:44.880,我估计到2020年,00:24:43.320,00:24:46.200,"I suppose for the 2020 U.S. presidential election,"
00:24:45.080,00:24:46.280,美国总统大选,,,
00:24:46.280,00:24:47.400,你也看着个,,,
00:24:47.440,00:24:47.800,个,,,
00:24:48.440,00:24:49.680,哪个党派,00:24:46.480,00:24:50.431,you'll probably know who will win
00:24:49.720,00:24:50.640,特朗普还是谁的,,,
00:24:51.440,00:24:53.640,这个叫什么竞选的帽子,00:24:50.440,00:24:56.700,by seeing which party's hats sell the best.
00:24:53.800,00:24:55.440,什么卖得更好,,,
00:24:55.440,00:24:56.880,你大概知道谁会赢,,,
00:24:57.400,00:24:59.120,反正是一个新的指数系统,00:24:57.100,00:24:59.220,"Anyway, it is a new index system,"
00:24:59.120,00:25:03.000,中国人可以更幽默的看这个世界,00:24:59.320,00:25:02.660,through which the Chinese people can see the world more humorously.
00:25:03.720,00:25:06.560,世界上实际上总是有一些人,,,
00:25:07.200,00:25:08.880,对中国有各种,00:25:03.680,00:25:10.320,Some people in the world have always been questioning China.
00:25:09.600,00:25:10.520,质疑,,,
00:25:10.680,00:25:12.000,比方说他们有的人说,00:25:10.640,00:25:11.817,"For example, some say that"
00:25:12.000,00:25:13.800,你们光是量的增长,00:25:11.820,00:25:14.940,[the economy of] China has only grown in quantity but not in quality.
00:25:13.800,00:25:15.200,没有质的增长,,,
00:25:15.720,00:25:17.560,实际上中国质的增长,00:25:15.880,00:25:18.960,"In fact, China's qualitative growth is also fast,"
00:25:17.560,00:25:18.880,也是非常快的,,,
00:25:19.200,00:25:21.760,包括我们在科研创新方面,00:25:19.060,00:25:22.680,including our great progress in scientific research and innovations.
00:25:21.760,00:25:23.000,巨大的进步,,,
00:25:23.040,00:25:23.560,坦率讲,,,
00:25:23.560,00:25:25.360,世界上进步最快的国家,00:25:22.840,00:25:25.540,"Frankly speaking, China is the country with the fastest progress in the world."
00:25:26.000,00:25:27.080,那么刚才提到的,,,
00:25:27.400,00:25:28.680,华为公司崛起,00:25:26.000,00:25:29.720,While the rise of Huawei I just mentioned is the epitome.
00:25:28.720,00:25:29.960,就是一个缩影,,,
00:25:30.400,00:25:32.560,我还可以举出许多其他的例子,00:25:30.040,00:25:32.340,"I can give some other examples,"
00:25:32.720,00:25:35.760,由中国以高铁为代表的,00:25:32.560,00:25:33.780,such as China's rail transportation
00:25:35.760,00:25:37.480,轨道交通装备,00:25:33.780,00:25:38.740,"represented by high-speed trains, China’s communication equipment,"
00:25:37.720,00:25:39.000,通信设备,,,
00:25:39.120,00:25:40.600,智能手机,00:25:39.020,00:25:41.680,"smartphones, and power grids."
00:25:40.720,00:25:41.880,电网,,,
00:25:42.200,00:25:43.720,中国有全球最好的,,,
00:25:43.720,00:25:44.720,特高压技术,00:25:42.060,00:25:46.040,"China has the world 's best UHV, smart grid technologies,"
00:25:44.720,00:25:46.160,和智能电网技术,,,
00:25:46.480,00:25:48.240,自主产权的5级技术,00:25:46.040,00:25:47.980,"and 5G technologies with independent property rights,"
00:25:48.240,00:25:49.760,这些美国人很害怕,00:25:47.980,00:25:49.820,which panic America a lot.
00:25:49.760,00:25:52.520,我们或多或少在不少方面走在前,00:25:50.120,00:25:52.700,We are more or less ahead in many aspects:
00:25:52.520,00:25:53.000,列,,,
00:25:53.080,00:25:54.240,中国的水电,,,
00:25:54.240,00:25:55.080,火电,00:25:52.880,00:25:56.340,"China's hydropower, thermal power, and fourth-generation nuclear power."
00:25:55.080,00:25:56.520,第四代核电,,,
00:25:56.520,00:25:58.840,中国最世界上最大的工程项目,00:25:56.520,00:26:00.080,"Almost all the world's largest engineering projects are in China,"
00:25:58.840,00:26:00.240,几乎都在中国,,,
00:26:00.440,00:26:02.560,包括高铁工程,00:26:00.540,00:26:02.260,"including high-speed rails,"
00:26:02.600,00:26:05.240,包括主港珠澳大桥,00:26:02.260,00:26:04.800,"Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge,"
00:26:05.400,00:26:07.280,包括隐形战机,00:26:05.000,00:26:08.180,"stealth fighters, large transport aircraft,"
00:26:07.280,00:26:08.480,大型运输机,,,

00:26:11.160,00:26:12.920,北斗定位系统,,,
00:26:13.000,00:26:15.320,这页岩气开发等等,00:26:11.280,00:26:15.300,"BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, shale gas development, etc."
00:26:15.360,00:26:17.960,应该说中国现在实际上都是领先,00:26:15.480,00:26:18.420,It can be said that China is leading the world in these fields.
00:26:17.960,00:26:18.440,的,,,
00:26:18.520,00:26:20.480,那么我的结论实际上非常简单,00:26:18.440,00:26:20.440,My conclusion is simple.
00:26:20.480,00:26:22.920,就是经过70年的,,,
00:26:23.000,00:26:26.800,经过我们中国人民的奋斗和探索,00:26:20.980,00:26:26.580,"That is, after 70 years of endeavor and exploration,"
00:26:26.960,00:26:30.560,应该说我们找到了自己成功之路,00:26:26.900,00:26:30.320,Chinese people have found their way to success.
00:26:30.800,00:26:33.120,我们把它叫做中国特色社会主义,00:26:30.720,00:26:33.080,We call it “socialism with Chinese characteristics”
00:26:33.360,00:26:35.240,我有时也说就是中国模式,00:26:33.100,00:26:35.100,and I sometimes call it the China Model.
00:26:35.640,00:26:37.480,那么这是可以这样说,00:26:35.580,00:26:37.120,We can say that
00:26:37.520,00:26:40.640,这是整个人类的历史上,00:26:37.480,00:26:41.100,China is the first socialist country in human history
00:26:40.680,00:26:43.440,第1次一个社会主义国家,00:26:41.240,00:26:44.340,that has become the world's largest economy
00:26:44.400,00:26:45.960,根据购买力平价,,,
00:26:46.000,00:26:48.640,已经成为世界最大的经济体,00:26:44.720,00:26:47.520,"according to the purchasing power parity,"
00:26:49.760,00:26:52.200,创造了世界最大的中产阶层,00:26:49.540,00:26:51.980,"created the world's largest middle class,"
00:26:52.200,00:26:54.880,向世界输出最多的游客,00:26:52.360,00:26:54.640,and exported the most tourists to the world.
00:26:55.200,00:26:56.800,具有世界最大的,,,
00:26:56.800,00:26:59.560,也是增长最快的消费市场,00:26:55.300,00:26:59.200,"China also has the largest and fastest-growing consumers’ market,"
00:26:59.880,00:27:02.520,中国有世界最大的外汇储备,00:26:59.920,00:27:02.320,"the world's largest foreign exchange reserves,"
00:27:03.280,00:27:05.840,而且世界最大的货物贸易国,00:27:03.140,00:27:05.640,and is the world's largest trader of goods.
00:27:06.240,00:27:08.520,还基本实现了全民的养老,00:27:06.320,00:27:09.400,China has basically achieved universal pension plan and health care.
00:27:08.560,00:27:09.040,俺和,,,
00:27:09.080,00:27:11.880,医保虽然水平有时候参差不齐,00:27:09.620,00:27:11.740,"Although there are inequalities in these systems,"
00:27:11.960,00:27:13.800,但至少你美国没有做到,00:27:11.740,00:27:13.940,at least the United States has not achieved this.
00:27:14.600,00:27:17.520,所以不管我们今天存在多少问题,00:27:14.640,00:27:17.280,"Therefore, no matter how many problems we still have today,"
00:27:17.560,00:27:20.040,我觉得我们可以先肯定这些成就,,,
00:27:20.040,00:27:22.120,这是来之不易得很不容易的,00:27:18.380,00:27:22.120,we must first affirm our hard-earned achievements
00:27:22.320,00:27:23.440,在这个基础上,,,
00:27:23.480,00:27:25.200,把我们的工作做得更好,00:27:22.320,00:27:25.020,and then enhance our work on this basis.
00:27:25.200,00:27:26.560,虽然这个模式,,,
00:27:26.560,00:27:28.400,还在不断完善之中,00:27:25.480,00:27:28.220,"Although this model is still being improved,"
00:27:28.640,00:27:33.240,但是现在水平也经得起国际比较,00:27:28.520,00:27:30.520,"China can stand up to international comparisons,"
00:27:33.480,00:27:35.360,我相信我们只要沿着,00:27:30.880,00:27:32.880,even with our current status.
00:27:35.360,00:27:38.280,我们自己探索出来的成功之路,00:27:33.280,00:27:39.360,"I believe that as long as we continue to move forward along our explored “road to success”,"
00:27:38.520,00:27:39.360,继续前行,,,
00:27:39.360,00:27:42.760,我们的前景一定会更加的辉煌,00:27:39.860,00:27:42.580,our future will be even brighter!
00:27:42.800,00:27:43.680,今天就说这些,00:27:42.660,00:27:44.660,"That's my speech for today, thank you."

00:27:43.720,00:27:44.440,谢谢大家,,,
00:27:49.800,00:27:50.600,谢谢张老师,,,
00:27:50.600,00:27:53.640,刚才贡献了一段非常精彩的演讲,00:27:50.400,00:27:53.380,"Thank you, Professor Zhang, for your wonderful speech."
00:27:53.640,00:27:55.160,刚才您在演讲当中也说,00:27:53.380,00:27:55.260,"As you mentioned in the speech,"
00:27:55.160,00:27:56.160,其实现在中国人,,,
00:27:56.160,00:27:56.560,已经到了,,,
00:27:56.560,00:27:58.320,要自信起来的时候,00:27:55.420,00:27:58.180,it's now time for the Chinese people to be confident.
00:27:58.320,00:28:00.560,有很多朋友在讲说,00:27:58.180,00:28:00.140,Many people say that
00:28:00.760,00:28:03.080,虽然中国的发展是有长足的进步,00:28:00.960,00:28:04.840,"we should have more confidence in China for China’s great progress,"
00:28:03.120,00:28:04.960,我们也觉得应该有点自信,,,
00:28:05.000,00:28:06.400,但是仿佛又觉得,,,
00:28:06.560,00:28:07.560,这个自信,,,
00:28:07.560,00:28:08.840,是不是应该控制到,00:28:05.040,00:28:10.120,but they also wonder to what extent this confidence is appropriate.
00:28:08.840,00:28:09.720,一个怎么样的度,,,
00:28:09.720,00:28:10.600,才是合适的,,,
00:28:10.600,00:28:11.880,比如说有的朋友也讲,,,
00:28:11.880,00:28:13.600,我们中国比较厉害的,00:28:11.380,00:28:15.340,"For example, some say that China is good at net sports,"
00:28:13.600,00:28:14.440,这种体育项目,,,
00:28:14.440,00:28:16.560,是隔着网的晋升搏击类的,,,
00:28:16.560,00:28:19.320,可能相对就不是那么的擅长未来,00:28:15.560,00:28:18.700,but are somehow disadvantaged in the combat sports.
00:28:19.320,00:28:20.560,我们在竞争的时候,00:28:18.700,00:28:20.420,"In country-to-country competitions,"
00:28:20.560,00:28:22.720,可能免不了会跟一些对象,,,
00:28:22.720,00:28:25.840,会发生近距离的肉搏,00:28:20.780,00:28:25.880,we may have “close combats” with another country.
00:28:25.880,00:28:28.280,对我们能不能hold住,00:28:26.040,00:28:28.120,Can we do well in such competitions?
00:28:29.080,00:28:31.000,这就是中国今天的利益,00:28:29.040,00:28:30.660,China Now
00:28:31.000,00:28:31.760,已经,,,
00:28:31.800,00:28:33.240,覆盖全世界了,00:28:30.660,00:28:33.080,"Today, China’s interests encompass the entire world."
00:28:33.800,00:28:35.960,你还不敢站出来捍卫自己的利益,00:28:33.980,00:28:37.660,"If you dare not stand up and defend your own interests,
who will stand up for you?"
00:28:35.960,00:28:37.600,谁来捍卫你的利益,,,
00:28:39.680,00:28:43.160,实际上中国人不大认同这种逻辑,00:28:39.820,00:28:41.820,"In fact, Chinese people don't agree with this logic."
00:28:43.200,00:28:43.920,舆论当中,,,
00:28:43.960,00:28:44.840,不管是国内,,,
00:28:44.840,00:28:45.560,还是海外,,,
00:28:45.560,00:28:47.720,有这种焦虑质疑,00:28:43.180,00:28:47.960,"In the press both domestic and abroad,
we see anxiety and doubt."
00:28:48.040,00:28:48.920,如果你还是不,,,
00:28:48.960,00:28:49.960,愿意相信,00:28:48.300,00:28:51.500,"But if they still choose not to believe us, so what?"
00:28:50.040,00:28:50.800,是我,,,
00:28:56.680,00:29:00.600,这就是中国听张维为说,00:28:56.860,00:29:00.300,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:29:02.320,00:29:03.440,我们要自信,,,
00:29:03.440,00:29:04.560,但不要自负,00:29:02.080,00:29:05.020,"We must be confident, but not conceited."
00:29:05.360,00:29:07.160,如果你对中国的成绩,,,
00:29:07.200,00:29:08.280,对世界的比较,00:29:05.020,00:29:10.720,"If you have true confidence about China’s achievements in comparison with the world,"
00:29:08.320,00:29:11.080,你发自内心的这种自信的话,,,
00:29:11.200,00:29:12.000,你跟谁讲,,,
00:29:12.040,00:29:12.720,跟老外讲,00:29:11.220,00:29:13.980,the foreigners or whoever you talk with will be impressed.
00:29:12.720,00:29:14.000,他也会被感染的,,,
00:29:14.000,00:29:16.360,所以我就是很自然的一个东西,00:29:14.140,00:29:16.140,This is very natural.
00:29:16.400,00:29:17.520,而且我觉得有时候,,,
00:29:17.560,00:29:18.560,比方你前面举的例子,00:29:16.640,00:29:19.040,I like the example you gave:
00:29:18.560,00:29:19.200,我觉得挺好,,,
00:29:19.200,00:29:22.000,好像中国在没有直接人与人碰撞,00:29:19.380,00:29:23.460,"China is good at sports without person-to-person collisions,"
00:29:22.000,00:29:22.480,的运动中,,,
00:29:22.520,00:29:23.560,做的都很好,,,
00:29:23.560,00:29:25.880,直接碰撞足球什么就不行,00:29:23.660,00:29:25.660,but bad at sports like soccer.
00:29:26.120,00:29:27.200,那么有一种办法,,,
00:29:27.200,00:29:27.440,就是,,,
00:29:27.440,00:29:29.960,我们也去练习,00:29:26.640,00:29:30.380,One solution is to practice collision sports.
00:29:29.960,00:29:31.240,这种直接碰撞的应用,,,
00:29:31.280,00:29:32.040,这是一个办法,,,
00:29:32.080,00:29:32.520,还有办法,,,
00:29:32.560,00:29:34.160,就是把我们自己的,,,
00:29:34.840,00:29:37.200,比方乒乓球这样运动,00:29:32.120,00:29:36.820,Another is to promote the sports we are good at in the international arena
00:29:37.240,00:29:39.320,我们把自己推向国际,00:29:36.820,00:29:40.940,"and make them the mainstream sports, such as table tennis."
00:29:39.320,00:29:40.880,成为国际主流运动,,,
00:29:40.880,00:29:42.040,西方也是这样做的,00:29:40.940,00:29:42.080,This is also what the West has done.
00:29:42.080,00:29:43.560,它的运动本来并不是,,,
00:29:43.680,00:29:45.800,世界多数国家人民都喜欢的,00:29:42.260,00:29:45.600,Western sports were originally not popular in most countries.
00:29:45.840,00:29:48.000,这两天我在朋友圈看到一个段子,00:29:45.940,00:29:48.080,Recently I saw a WeChat meme
00:29:48.000,00:29:50.000,就在传说2018,,,
00:29:50.160,00:29:50.440,为什么,00:29:48.680,00:29:52.140,about how everyone seemed to have “Mercury Retrograde” in 2018?
00:29:50.480,00:29:52.480,每个人好像都在水逆,,,
00:29:52.480,00:29:53.600,国家这个层面,,,
00:29:53.640,00:29:55.120,也是我们今年经历了,00:29:52.500,00:29:56.120,"Even for China, we have experienced Sino-US trade frictions"
00:29:55.160,00:29:56.200,中美贸易摩擦,,,
00:29:56.200,00:29:58.200,包括最近的孟晚舟事件,00:29:56.120,00:29:57.880,and the recent incident of Meng Wanzhou.
00:29:58.600,00:29:59.280,舆论当中,,,
00:29:59.320,00:30:00.120,不管是国内,,,
00:30:00.120,00:30:00.920,还是海外,00:29:58.140,00:30:03.480,"In the press both domestic and abroad,
we see anxiety and doubt."
00:30:00.920,00:30:03.680,有这种焦虑质疑我,,,
00:30:03.720,00:30:05.760,我们是应该怎么去进行一个,,,
00:30:05.760,00:30:07.600,自理的心理建设和评估,00:30:03.840,00:30:08.020,How should we evaluate and respond to these?
00:30:07.720,00:30:07.960,不,,,
00:30:08.000,00:30:08.600,我觉得,,,
00:30:10.200,00:30:11.560,今天我们讨论的问题,,,
00:30:11.560,00:30:13.800,包括甚至可能这一年,00:30:08.260,00:30:18.160,I think what we are discussing here will help us see the bigger picture of China and the world.
00:30:14.160,00:30:17.200,实际上就是对中国和世界的一种,,,
00:30:17.200,00:30:18.520,整体把握,,,
00:30:18.520,00:30:20.640,没有这种整体把握的话,00:30:18.560,00:30:19.940,"Otherwise,"
00:30:20.640,00:30:22.760,你碰到一个事情就没有定力了,00:30:20.180,00:30:22.800,we would lose the strategic focus.
00:30:23.280,00:30:25.240,如果整体把握尼克斯,00:30:23.040,00:30:25.298,"If you can see the bigger picture,"
00:30:25.400,00:30:26.640,非常淡定的,00:30:25.300,00:30:26.560,you will stay calm.
00:30:26.640,00:30:30.200,比方说今年关于民营企业的,00:30:27.180,00:30:32.040,"For example, there are discussions about private enterprises"
00:30:31.240,00:30:32.320,很多议论,,,
00:30:32.320,00:30:34.600,说民营企业怎么样不行了,00:30:32.040,00:30:34.600,being sluggish or performing poorly in the market.
00:30:34.800,00:30:36.880,实际上你只要看中国整个,,,
00:30:36.880,00:30:38.600,宏观经济,00:30:34.900,00:30:40.560,"In fact, when you look at China’s
macroeconomic system —the mixed economy model,"
00:30:38.600,00:30:41.320,中国我们叫混合经济模式,,,
00:30:41.360,00:30:42.640,它就是两个板块,00:30:41.340,00:30:43.040,it includes two functioning sectors:
00:30:42.640,00:30:43.880,一个是政府的作用,,,
00:30:43.920,00:30:44.880,一个市场作用,00:30:43.040,00:30:44.800,the government and the market;
00:30:44.880,00:30:45.880,因为国有经济作用,00:30:44.840,00:30:46.840,the state-owned enterprises and the private enterprises.
00:30:45.880,00:30:47.240,一个民营企业的作用,,,
00:30:47.240,00:30:47.720,这样说,,,
00:30:47.720,00:30:49.480,用在我们这个模式里边,,,
00:30:49.520,00:30:50.880,它是互相补充,00:30:47.480,00:30:51.940,"In this model, the two sectors complement each other,"
00:30:50.880,00:30:52.120,相得益彰的,,,
00:30:52.360,00:30:53.560,但这当中,,,
00:30:53.760,00:30:55.720,它有时候是会有矛盾的,00:30:52.320,00:30:55.380,despite infrequent conflicts.
00:30:55.840,00:30:57.080,那么中央政府,,,
00:30:57.080,00:30:58.320,它的基本的做法,00:30:56.200,00:30:58.220,"When the two sectors are in conflicts,"
00:30:58.800,00:30:59.840,如果有矛盾,,,
00:30:59.840,00:31:03.160,希望两者能够变成互相补充的,00:30:58.220,00:31:03.040,the central government basically hopes to bring them into a complementary relationship.
00:31:03.360,00:31:05.320,你掌握大的格局之后,00:31:03.260,00:31:04.620,"In the bigger picture,"
00:31:05.320,00:31:06.560,他肯定有变化,00:31:04.620,00:31:08.200,"although there are fluctuations [in the performance of these sectors],"
00:31:06.560,00:31:09.000,那个变化最终肯定回到上边来的,,,
00:31:09.040,00:31:10.160,这叫中国模式,00:31:08.340,00:31:10.400,they will get back on track of the China Path.
00:31:10.160,00:31:11.040,中国道路,,,
00:31:11.200,00:31:12.360,所以我特别有定力,00:31:10.400,00:31:12.460,"With a strategic focus, we will stay calm."
00:31:12.720,00:31:13.720,这个信心,,,
00:31:13.760,00:31:15.240,特别重要,00:31:12.620,00:31:15.300,"- Yes, confidence is very important.
- Right."
00:31:15.680,00:31:16.160,张老师,,,
00:31:16.160,00:31:18.120,刚才您在演讲的时候,00:31:15.620,00:31:19.760,"Professor Zhang, you talked about development and changes just now."
00:31:18.160,00:31:19.760,谈到说发展变化,,,
00:31:20.000,00:31:21.320,昨天我一个大学同学,,,
00:31:21.320,00:31:22.240,跟我说了个例子,,,
00:31:22.240,00:31:24.200,他说其实国家的发展变化,00:31:20.400,00:31:25.100,"Yesterday, one of my college classmates who has been living abroad for years"
00:31:24.200,00:31:25.880,在个人的故事中,,,
00:31:25.880,00:31:27.000,可能是一些稀疏,,,
00:31:27.040,00:31:27.840,平常的小事,00:31:25.240,00:31:29.780,told me that China’s progress can be perceived in the small things in our life.
00:31:27.840,00:31:28.320,感觉到,,,
00:31:28.320,00:31:29.960,他是在国外生活了很多年,,,
00:31:30.160,00:31:31.240,有一年他回国的时候,,,
00:31:31.240,00:31:32.240,他跟他爸说说,00:31:29.940,00:31:34.500,"One year, before he returned to China,
he told his dad in China to buy a portable charger."
00:31:32.280,00:31:34.800,你给我手机买一个充电宝,,,
00:31:34.880,00:31:36.520,然后他爸说,,,
00:31:36.800,00:31:38.080,难道你在国外没有买的吗,00:31:35.440,00:31:39.220,His dad was like “Why don’t you just get one abroad?”
00:31:38.120,00:31:39.440,你在自己在那边买一个不就行了,,,
00:31:39.440,00:31:40.680,他说我没有发现,,,
00:31:40.680,00:31:42.000,有卖这种东西的地方,00:31:39.420,00:31:42.200,"My classmate said that he didn’t know where
people would sell portable chargers in his country."
00:31:42.360,00:31:42.560,对,,,
00:31:42.600,00:31:43.840,你那同学在哪,00:31:42.380,00:31:44.380,Which country was he in?
00:31:43.880,00:31:44.920,哪个国家,,,
00:31:44.960,00:31:46.520,没讲在法国,00:31:44.380,00:31:46.100,"No offense, he was in France."
00:31:47.320,00:31:49.080,实际上他的生活的变化,00:31:46.340,00:31:50.780,He said that the small changes he perceived in his life made him believe
00:31:49.080,00:31:50.640,是通过这样的小事来确定,,,
00:31:50.680,00:31:51.600,Or自己的国家,,,
00:31:51.600,00:31:53.320,其实已经早就超过了,00:31:51.080,00:31:54.560,"that China had already outpaced Western countries,"
00:31:53.320,00:31:54.640,至少在一些部分,,,
00:31:54.640,00:31:55.800,早就超过了西方,00:31:54.760,00:31:56.060,at least in some aspects.
00:31:56.000,00:31:57.120,14年的时候,,,
00:31:57.120,00:31:58.680,张老师有个中国人,00:31:56.240,00:31:59.400,"Professor Zhang published “The Chinese, You Need to Be Confident” in 2004."
00:31:58.680,00:31:59.400,你要自信,,,
00:31:59.400,00:31:59.800,对,,,
00:31:59.960,00:32:00.960,到今天,,,
00:32:01.000,00:32:02.800,其实你刚才在演讲里头,,,
00:32:02.800,00:32:05.400,也提到一点知识界有一些,00:32:00.300,00:32:06.940,"As you mentioned before, there was still a lack of
confidence among the intellectual community until today,"
00:32:05.440,00:32:07.480,其实大家还挺不自信的,,,
00:32:07.560,00:32:10.520,那个时候还算小众向,00:32:07.100,00:32:09.340,which only appealed to a small readership.
00:32:10.520,00:32:13.160,我们都会少数在听中国,00:32:09.900,00:32:14.100,Only a minority of us realized we should have been confident.
00:32:13.160,00:32:14.400,我们是该自信了,,,
00:32:14.520,00:32:16.440,可是到今天你发现很不一样了,00:32:14.360,00:32:16.460,But now you'll find something has changed.
00:32:16.480,00:32:19.160,整个群众基础是大了很多,00:32:16.640,00:32:18.860,The confident group has grown a lot.
00:32:19.200,00:32:20.480,实际上我讲中国自信,,,
00:32:20.480,00:32:21.200,不是现在讲,00:32:19.160,00:32:22.240,"I have been calling on for confidence for more than twenty years, not just from now."
00:32:21.200,00:32:22.360,我讲了20多年了,,,
00:32:22.400,00:32:23.080,了,,,
00:32:24.680,00:32:26.880,我们大家都读过书,00:32:24.760,00:32:27.785,"It can be compared with your school life,"
00:32:26.880,00:32:27.640,念过中学,,,
00:32:27.640,00:32:28.200,大学,,,
00:32:28.480,00:32:30.720,你在学生也是一样的,00:32:27.785,00:32:30.220,from middle school to university.
00:32:30.760,00:32:33.120,即使你现在成绩不怎么好,00:32:30.560,00:32:32.560,"even if you don’t get good grades,"
00:32:33.120,00:32:34.640,如果你说我自信,,,
00:32:34.640,00:32:35.880,我相信我通过努力,00:32:33.420,00:32:38.040,you still can catch up if you believe in yourself.
00:32:35.880,00:32:36.920,一定能够赶上去,,,
00:32:36.920,00:32:38.160,你才能赶上去,,,
00:32:38.200,00:32:38.520,对,,,
00:32:38.520,00:32:39.360,国家也是一样,,,
00:32:39.360,00:32:41.880,中华民族她有气质在里边的,00:32:38.040,00:32:41.440,This is also true for our country.
00:32:41.920,00:32:43.640,我们出国留学都这样,00:32:41.920,00:32:43.880,It is the same for Chinese students abroad.
00:32:43.640,00:32:44.880,很多年觉得,,,
00:32:44.880,00:32:45.720,我现在不行,00:32:43.880,00:32:46.800,"They feel that even if they are underperforming now,"
00:32:45.720,00:32:47.000,我一定要学得比人家好,,,
00:32:47.040,00:32:48.320,那有股劲儿在那,00:32:46.800,00:32:49.660,"they have to outperform [the local students]
in the future. They have the spirit."
00:32:48.360,00:32:48.840,对,,,
00:32:50.800,00:32:51.800,我知道在现场,,,
00:32:51.840,00:32:52.640,我们的观众朋友,,,
00:32:52.640,00:32:54.360,都非常的年轻,00:32:51.000,00:32:54.360,"I see that our audience is very young,"
00:32:54.360,00:32:55.960,而且你们也都是带着问题来的,00:32:54.360,00:32:56.120,and you all came with questions.
00:32:55.960,00:32:58.240,在现场我们会开放大家提问,00:32:56.120,00:32:58.040,Now we will start the Q&A segment.
00:32:58.280,00:32:59.240,张老师已经说了,,,
00:32:59.240,00:33:00.640,越尖锐越好,00:32:58.520,00:33:00.520,Professor Zhang welcomes all difficult questions.
00:33:00.640,00:33:02.520,大家尽管放马过来,00:33:01.160,00:33:03.160,Is everyone ready?
00:33:02.560,00:33:03.280,好不好,,,
00:33:03.560,00:33:06.960,我是来自新疆的一名小柯尔克孜,00:33:03.920,00:33:08.520,"- Professor Zhang, I am a Kirgiz student from Xinjiang.
- Welcome."
00:33:06.960,00:33:08.480,族同学生,,,
00:33:09.520,00:33:11.360,随着中国经济的发展,00:33:09.320,00:33:10.600,"As China's economy rises,"
00:33:11.400,00:33:13.120,少数民族传统文化,00:33:10.600,00:33:14.440,the traditional cultures of some ethnic minorities are negatively affected.
00:33:13.120,00:33:14.760,也受到了一些冲击,,,
00:33:15.080,00:33:18.000,那么我们如何在搞好现代化建设,00:33:14.980,00:33:19.960,How can we help ethnic minorities protect their unique cultures
00:33:18.000,00:33:18.840,的同时,,,
00:33:19.360,00:33:20.880,帮助少数民族同胞,,,
00:33:20.880,00:33:22.920,保留好他们的优秀的,00:33:19.960,00:33:24.360,while continuing modernization? Thank you.
00:33:22.960,00:33:24.520,民族特色的文化,,,
00:33:24.680,00:33:25.320,谢谢,,,
00:33:25.840,00:33:26.760,上个月的时候,00:33:25.320,00:33:27.540,"When we were in Germany last month,"
00:33:26.800,00:33:28.360,我们在德国,,,
00:33:28.400,00:33:28.840,一个,,,
00:33:28.880,00:33:30.960,德国人讲新疆的人权问题,00:33:27.660,00:33:30.900,a German talked about human rights issues in Xinjiang.
00:33:31.000,00:33:32.400,我问他去过没有,00:33:31.040,00:33:33.720,I asked him whether he had been to Xinjiang? He said “No”.
00:33:32.800,00:33:34.080,他没有去过,,,
00:33:34.200,00:33:36.520,我说我们在座的中国代表团,00:33:34.160,00:33:37.560,"I said that all of the Chinese delegation here are Han people,"
00:33:36.520,00:33:38.040,全是汉族人,,,
00:33:38.200,00:33:41.200,每个人都会唱维吾尔族歌曲,00:33:38.060,00:33:40.780,but all of us can sing Uyghur songs.
00:33:41.800,00:33:44.520,我们维吾尔族用的都是自己的,00:33:41.840,00:33:45.180,The Uyghur people still use their own script
00:33:44.520,00:33:45.560,文字,,,
00:33:45.880,00:33:48.160,讲的是自己的方言语言,00:33:45.460,00:33:48.240,and speak their own dialect.
00:33:48.160,00:33:51.360,实际上我们在保护少数民族文化,,,
00:33:51.360,00:33:51.760,方面,00:33:48.660,00:33:54.540,We are at the forefront of the world in protecting minority cultures.
00:33:51.800,00:33:54.640,总体上在世界走在前列的,,,
00:33:54.880,00:33:55.880,但我同意你的观点,,,
00:33:55.880,00:33:57.560,我们可以做得更好,00:33:54.700,00:33:57.460,But I agree with you that we can do better.
00:33:57.600,00:33:57.840,好,,,
00:33:57.840,00:33:58.280,谢谢,,,
00:33:58.280,00:34:00.120,我们这位年轻的朋友,00:33:57.880,00:33:59.880,Thank you very much.
00:34:01.480,00:34:03.160,有一些可能是历史性的因素,00:34:00.780,00:34:02.780,"For some historical reasons,"
00:34:03.880,00:34:05.720,我们国家在对于海外的,,,
00:34:05.720,00:34:06.080,那种,,,
00:34:06.120,00:34:07.200,政治影响力来说,00:34:03.460,00:34:10.500,"China's international political influence doesn't match
its economy's size and economic influence."
00:34:07.200,00:34:08.520,是与我们的经济体量,,,
00:34:08.520,00:34:09.640,与我们的经济影响力,,,
00:34:09.640,00:34:11.160,是严重的不匹配的,,,
00:34:11.280,00:34:12.240,那么您认为,,,
00:34:12.280,00:34:13.800,在未来一段时间里面,00:34:11.360,00:34:13.980,"Do you think that in the next few years,"
00:34:13.800,00:34:15.200,我们国家在这方面,,,
00:34:15.200,00:34:17.080,是会继续走以前的道路,,,
00:34:17.120,00:34:19.080,以前那种以经济带动政治的,00:34:14.240,00:34:20.700,"China will take the old way of gaining political influence
in a low profile while developing the economy,"
00:34:19.120,00:34:20.640,这种潜移默化的道路,,,
00:34:21.000,00:34:23.480,还是要更加积极主动的,00:34:20.820,00:34:25.480,"or that China will be more proactively
expanding its political influence?"
00:34:23.520,00:34:25.200,去推动我们的政治影响力,,,
00:34:25.640,00:34:26.560,谢谢,00:34:25.480,00:34:26.480,Thank you.
00:34:26.840,00:34:28.280,实际上你这个问题,,,
00:34:28.280,00:34:30.160,我觉得恐怕更涉及到,00:34:26.880,00:34:32.380,"I think your question is more
related to the rise of China’s hard power;"
00:34:30.480,00:34:32.560,中国的硬实力上来了,,,
00:34:32.720,00:34:35.960,好像软实力在国外影响还不是很,00:34:32.900,00:34:38.142,while China's soft power seems insignificant abroad
00:34:35.960,00:34:36.680,大,,,
00:34:36.880,00:34:38.120,那么这个问题,,,
00:34:38.120,00:34:39.520,它是有一个,00:34:38.142,00:34:40.740,for some historical reasons.
00:34:40.080,00:34:41.080,历史原因的,,,
00:34:41.280,00:34:42.480,你刚才讲了一部分,00:34:40.740,00:34:43.100,"Some of the reasons, as you mentioned,"
00:34:42.480,00:34:44.320,我们比方说埋头发展经济,00:34:43.100,00:34:45.500,are that China has been immersed in developing its economy
00:34:44.600,00:34:46.640,闷声发大财等等,,,
00:34:46.720,00:34:49.960,所以可能忽视了软实力的提高,00:34:45.620,00:34:49.440,and creating wealth but ignoring the growth of its soft power.
00:34:50.280,00:34:51.160,但是,,,
00:34:51.800,00:34:53.560,中国实际上软实力,00:34:50.300,00:34:56.360,China's soft power can grow a little faster.
00:34:55.120,00:34:56.880,可以上升的更快一点,,,
00:34:57.000,00:34:58.760,那么现在习近平主席,,,
00:34:58.760,00:35:00.600,已经把讲好中国故事,00:34:57.020,00:35:03.420,"President Xi Jinping has set
""telling the stories of China"" as a strategic task."
00:35:00.600,00:35:03.720,看作是一个战略任务在做,,,
00:35:03.880,00:35:07.920,那么的关键还是你软实力背后,00:35:04.060,00:35:09.040,The key is to have the power to tell stories.
00:35:07.960,00:35:09.360,你真的是要有实力,,,
00:35:09.360,00:35:12.720,它不能只是你有钱到国外哪里去,00:35:09.520,00:35:15.000,"It is not only about spending on TV stations or websites abroad,"
00:35:12.720,00:35:13.920,办个电视台,,,
00:35:13.960,00:35:15.240,办个什么网站,,,
00:35:15.280,00:35:17.960,而是你话语的穿透力,00:35:15.020,00:35:17.700,but also about the penetrability of our language.
00:35:18.720,00:35:19.440,那么你的话语,,,
00:35:19.480,00:35:21.120,能不能被人家理解,00:35:18.080,00:35:22.340,Can your words be understood and accepted by others?
00:35:21.120,00:35:22.480,被人家接受,,,
00:35:22.560,00:35:23.560,我给你举个例子,00:35:22.340,00:35:23.440,"For example,"
00:35:23.560,00:35:26.120,西方老是用民主还是专制,00:35:23.500,00:35:28.260,"Western countries always divide
political systems into democracy or autocracy."
00:35:26.120,00:35:28.240,来定性世界所有的政治体制,,,
00:35:28.240,00:35:29.280,我说错,00:35:28.260,00:35:29.640,I say this is wrong.
00:35:29.800,00:35:31.400,我说如果你要把世界上的,,,
00:35:31.400,00:35:31.960,政治体制,00:35:29.840,00:35:33.180,"If you want to divide the world's political systems into two categories,"
00:35:31.960,00:35:33.200,分为两类,,,
00:35:33.240,00:35:34.480,只有grace,,,
00:35:34.520,00:35:35.520,bag,00:35:33.400,00:35:37.180,there are only good governance and bad governance.
00:35:35.560,00:35:37.240,良政还是劣制,,,
00:35:37.680,00:35:39.920,梁政可以是西方的民主制度,00:35:37.420,00:35:39.880,Good governance can be a Western democratic system
00:35:39.920,00:35:42.240,可以是非西方的民主制度,00:35:39.880,00:35:41.860,or a non-Western democratic system.
00:35:42.360,00:35:44.960,那么这就是一种比较强势的话语,00:35:42.320,00:35:44.600,This is a relatively more powerful narrative
00:35:44.960,00:35:47.360,现在接受的人开始多起来了,00:35:44.760,00:35:46.760,and more people are beginning to accept it.
00:35:47.400,00:35:50.200,所以我觉得关键是你软实力跟硬,00:35:47.000,00:35:51.280,"Whether soft power or hard power, it is power."
00:35:50.200,00:35:50.400,实,,,
00:35:50.440,00:35:51.600,它是一种实力,,,
00:35:52.040,00:35:53.400,过去人家不想听,00:35:51.560,00:35:54.180,"People used to have no interest in what China said,"
00:35:53.400,00:35:54.360,中国说什么,,,
00:35:54.360,00:35:56.040,现在人家很想听,00:35:54.180,00:35:55.780,but now they are eager to listen.
00:35:56.120,00:35:57.480,你到任何地方,,,
00:35:57.880,00:36:00.320,你要举办一个中国的讲座,00:35:56.140,00:36:00.160,"Wherever you hold a lecture about China,"
00:36:00.320,00:36:01.240,趋之若鹜,00:36:00.180,00:36:02.180,people are flocking to attend.
00:36:01.240,00:36:02.400,真是这样的,,,
00:36:02.400,00:36:03.520,而谢谢,,,
00:36:03.960,00:36:04.640,积极主动,00:36:02.860,00:36:06.200,"Proactiveness doesn't mean that we are aggressive,"
00:36:04.640,00:36:06.240,并不是说我们要咄咄逼人,,,
00:36:06.240,00:36:07.800,而是就像刚才张老师说的,00:36:06.360,00:36:07.460,"but like Prof Zhang said,"
00:36:07.800,00:36:09.680,用他们听得懂的方式,00:36:07.480,00:36:11.820,tell them about China’s peaceful rise in a way they can understand.
00:36:09.680,00:36:10.560,去跟他们讲,,,
00:36:10.560,00:36:12.040,我们是和平崛起,,,
00:36:12.080,00:36:12.240,好,,,
00:36:12.240,00:36:13.720,接下来我再看下一位,00:36:12.340,00:36:14.480,Let's move on to the next quetion.
00:36:13.720,00:36:15.920,提问的朋友再来好这位来,00:36:14.720,00:36:15.940,"Yes, please."
00:36:16.120,00:36:17.520,开头听到您讲了一个,00:36:16.280,00:36:17.720,When I heard you saying that
00:36:17.560,00:36:19.520,我们要对自己有一个定位,00:36:17.720,00:36:19.440,"we should know our global position,"
00:36:19.560,00:36:21.520,然后我就想起了一个说法,00:36:19.480,00:36:21.360,it reminded me that
00:36:21.520,00:36:24.480,就是说全球的霸主一百年一换,00:36:21.360,00:36:24.360,the global hegemon is said to be changing every one hundred years.
00:36:24.520,00:36:26.240,就像曾经的荷兰,,,
00:36:26.880,00:36:28.040,作为海上马车夫,00:36:24.520,00:36:29.180,"For example, the Netherlands ruled for more than one hundred years as the ""sea coachman"","
00:36:28.080,00:36:29.360,统治了100多年,,,
00:36:29.400,00:36:31.840,美国靠它的制造业,,,
00:36:31.840,00:36:33.000,以及发战争财,00:36:29.280,00:36:34.860,"and the United States has been dominant for almost
 100 years owing to its manufacture industry and war profiteering."
00:36:33.000,00:36:34.600,也是差不多一百年了,,,
00:36:34.600,00:36:35.720,那么我们中国,,,
00:36:35.720,00:36:38.080,是否会在接下来这一百年,00:36:34.960,00:36:39.680,"So, will China take dominance in the next century,"
00:36:38.400,00:36:39.920,达到霸主的地位,,,
00:36:39.920,00:36:42.040,以及我们是否会去承认,00:36:39.740,00:36:42.520,and will we admit this new position?
00:36:43.040,00:36:46.480,实际上中国人不大认同这种逻辑,00:36:43.080,00:36:46.380,"In fact, Chinese people don't agree with this logic."
00:36:46.680,00:36:50.520,因为中国是个五千年文明古国,00:36:46.500,00:36:50.844,China has been ahead of the West in most periods
00:36:50.520,00:36:52.520,在历史上多数的时间内,,,
00:36:52.560,00:36:54.640,中国是领先西方的,00:36:50.844,00:36:54.360,of its five-thousand-year history.
00:36:54.640,00:36:56.240,郑和下西洋的时候,,,
00:36:56.240,00:36:58.600,明朝十五世纪上半叶,00:36:54.600,00:36:58.260,"In the first half of the 15th century, the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He reached the waters of Indian Ocean"
00:36:58.800,00:37:01.840,他主力舰的排水量是哥伦布,00:36:58.340,00:37:02.740,eighty years before Columbus discovered the new continent.
00:37:01.840,00:37:03.120,发现美洲大陆,,,
00:37:03.280,00:37:04.840,还更晚80多年,00:37:02.740,00:37:06.500,"The main ship's drainage was a hundred times bigger
than the main ship of Columbus."
00:37:05.600,00:37:06.400,一百倍,,,
00:37:06.440,00:37:08.440,那么在那个时候,00:37:07.020,00:37:09.360,"Different from western countries,"
00:37:08.440,00:37:10.680,我们也没有像西方那样,,,
00:37:10.680,00:37:11.840,搞殖民,00:37:09.360,00:37:12.660,we didn't colonize or invade other countries.
00:37:11.880,00:37:13.040,搞侵略,,,
00:37:13.040,00:37:14.960,所以中国的文化基因是不一样的,00:37:13.160,00:37:15.160,You can see that China has different cultural genes.
00:37:14.960,00:37:17.800,中国人真是一种崇尚和平的文化,00:37:15.300,00:37:17.800,Chinese culture truly advocates peace.
00:37:17.800,00:37:18.720,你这个问题,,,
00:37:18.720,00:37:19.920,有点美国人的逻辑,00:37:17.980,00:37:20.520,"You have asked that question in America’s logic, that is,"
00:37:20.000,00:37:21.320,就你赢我输,,,
00:37:21.320,00:37:22.920,或者我赢你输,00:37:20.520,00:37:23.100,there will always be a winner and a loser.
00:37:23.480,00:37:25.160,那么中国觉得这完全可以,,,
00:37:26.280,00:37:26.840,盍,00:37:23.520,00:37:30.000,"China’s logic is that two countries can play a win-win or all-win game,"
00:37:26.880,00:37:27.720,合作共赢,,,
00:37:27.760,00:37:29.640,或者叫引双赢,,,
00:37:29.640,00:37:30.920,多赢的这种游戏,,,
00:37:30.920,00:37:32.680,但他们有种不接受,00:37:30.060,00:37:32.400,but America doesn't accept this.
00:37:32.760,00:37:34.040,但我老讲这个观点,,,
00:37:34.040,00:37:36.280,就是形势比人强,00:37:32.680,00:37:36.020,I often say that they will accept it
00:37:36.520,00:37:38.640,因为中国的发展势头,00:37:36.160,00:37:39.620,because China's development momentum can't be reversed.
00:37:38.640,00:37:39.600,没法扭转的,,,
00:37:40.320,00:37:41.880,我们自己的预判,00:37:40.360,00:37:43.180,"Our prediction is that 30 years later,"
00:37:41.880,00:37:43.280,就是30年之后,,,
00:37:43.280,00:37:45.040,到你们90后,,,
00:37:45.040,00:37:46.080,00后,,,
00:37:46.600,00:37:49.440,成为社会绝对的中坚力量的时候,00:37:43.280,00:37:49.280,"when our young people born in the 90s and 00s
become the backbone of the society,"
00:37:49.440,00:37:50.800,我在做一个预测,,,
00:37:51.240,00:37:53.400,就中国的经济规模,00:37:49.340,00:37:55.120,China's economic size measured by purchasing power parity
00:37:53.440,00:37:55.680,根据购买力平价,,,
00:37:56.120,00:37:58.960,应该是美国,00:37:56.100,00:38:01.720,"will be the sum of the United States and the European Union,"
00:37:59.000,00:38:01.960,加欧盟之和,,,
00:38:03.800,00:38:05.440,如果欧盟还存在的话,00:38:03.660,00:38:06.780,if the EU still exists.
00:38:06.760,00:38:07.440,对,,,
00:38:08.480,00:38:09.400,所以到那个时候,,,
00:38:09.400,00:38:10.000,有些问题,,,
00:38:10.000,00:38:12.040,根本就是英文叫一热问题,00:38:08.140,00:38:15.140,"At that time, it will be irrelevant to talk about
who is said to be Number One."
00:38:12.040,00:38:13.560,我根本不在乎,,,
00:38:13.560,00:38:14.280,随便你说,,,
00:38:14.280,00:38:15.040,你是南部,,,
00:38:15.040,00:38:15.800,我是南北退,,,
00:38:15.800,00:38:17.200,或者什么东西,,,
00:38:17.320,00:38:19.520,美国说我要退出全球化,00:38:15.640,00:38:19.320,"If the United States claims to withdraw from globalization,"
00:38:19.600,00:38:20.440,坦率说,,,
00:38:20.480,00:38:21.840,这不是我们中国政府的声音,00:38:19.320,00:38:23.100,"frankly speaking for myself as a scholar rather than our government,"
00:38:21.840,00:38:23.280,我作为一个学者的观点,,,
00:38:23.280,00:38:24.400,我说so what,00:38:23.440,00:38:25.180,"I would say ""So what?"""
00:38:24.440,00:38:25.120,对不对,,,
00:38:25.120,00:38:26.560,130多国家,,,
00:38:26.800,00:38:28.440,还是我的最大的贸易伙伴,00:38:25.440,00:38:29.060,China is still the biggest trading partner of more than 130 countries;
00:38:28.480,00:38:28.800,对不对,,,
00:38:28.800,00:38:30.480,我们还继续可以带领这些国家,,,
00:38:30.480,00:38:31.280,往前走,00:38:29.240,00:38:31.740,we can continue to go forward leading these countries.
00:38:31.360,00:38:32.040,对不对,,,
00:38:32.520,00:38:34.920,所以你自己崛起之后,00:38:32.620,00:38:34.800,We don’t need to care about the rankings
00:38:34.960,00:38:37.040,也不要去管他这么排名了,00:38:34.920,00:38:36.680,when China has risen.
00:38:37.040,00:38:38.720,我对这些排名我从来不看,00:38:36.680,00:38:38.660,I never look at them.
00:38:39.520,00:38:40.960,刚才这位朋友这个观点,00:38:39.600,00:38:42.040,This question also made me think about
00:38:40.960,00:38:42.280,其实我也有启发,,,
00:38:42.280,00:38:43.480,之前很多年前,,,
00:38:43.520,00:38:45.040,大家都已经在反思,,,
00:38:45.080,00:38:47.760,说发现好像我们对西方倒是蛮,00:38:42.580,00:38:48.040,"how we know the West quite well,"
00:38:47.760,00:38:48.640,了解的,,,
00:38:48.640,00:38:50.080,因为我们自从改革开放以后,,,
00:38:50.080,00:38:53.320,真的一直是打开国门在看西方,00:38:48.320,00:38:53.120,"especially after Reform and Opening,"
00:38:53.320,00:38:54.040,但是反过来,,,
00:38:54.040,00:38:55.960,好像他们对我们不太了解,00:38:53.460,00:38:55.920,"but in turn, the West seems to be quite unfamiliar with us,"
00:38:55.960,00:38:56.920,对我们的文化,,,
00:38:56.920,00:38:58.800,对我们整个国家政治发展,00:38:55.980,00:38:59.320,"with our culture, and with China’s political developments."
00:38:58.800,00:39:00.040,种种都不了解,,,
00:39:00.040,00:39:01.760,如果他们始终不了解,00:39:00.160,00:39:02.160,"So, what should we do"
00:39:01.800,00:39:02.400,我们,,,
00:39:02.760,00:39:04.120,也不打算聊,,,
00:39:04.280,00:39:05.880,我们怎么办,00:39:02.220,00:39:06.180,"if they always fail to understand China
and don’t intend to understand China?"
00:39:05.920,00:39:06.480,搜狐,,,
00:39:06.520,00:39:07.320,对吧,,,
00:39:07.800,00:39:08.160,对,,,
00:39:08.480,00:39:10.440,我今年10月15号,00:39:07.900,00:39:12.680,I gave a speech at Harvard University on October 15th this year [2018].
00:39:10.440,00:39:12.800,在哈佛大学一个演讲,,,
00:39:13.160,00:39:15.360,那么后来我们互动的时候,00:39:12.940,00:39:16.680,"In the Q&A segment, we also discussed this question."
00:39:15.360,00:39:16.920,也是到这个问题,,,
00:39:17.400,00:39:18.120,我就说了,,,
00:39:18.120,00:39:19.440,我们是苦口婆心,00:39:16.940,00:39:21.240,"I said we had been repeatedly and kindly explaining China,"
00:39:19.600,00:39:19.800,对吧,,,
00:39:19.800,00:39:21.560,跟你一遍遍的解释,,,
00:39:21.600,00:39:23.640,如果你还是不愿意相信,00:39:21.360,00:39:24.460,"but if the West still choose not to believe us, so what?"
00:39:23.640,00:39:24.200,So what,,,
00:39:25.320,00:39:26.000,could leave,,,
00:39:26.040,00:39:26.520,有韵达,,,
00:39:26.520,00:39:27.240,肯定是,,,
00:39:27.240,00:39:28.520,我们可以把你们,00:39:25.120,00:39:29.500,"""We could leave you in darkness."""
00:39:28.520,00:39:29.560,留在黑暗中,,,
00:39:29.560,00:39:30.360,为东开,00:39:29.500,00:39:31.140,"""We don't care."""
00:39:30.360,00:39:31.320,我们不在乎,,,
00:39:31.320,00:39:33.080,也是就德国这一次,,,
00:39:33.280,00:39:34.680,他们对我们的一带一路,00:39:31.560,00:39:37.040,"Germany was frowning upon our ""Belt and Road Initiative""."
00:39:35.560,00:39:37.280,横挑鼻子竖挑眼,,,
00:39:37.720,00:39:39.720,后来我说呵呵,,,
00:39:40.880,00:39:43.960,这是真的大概10来年前,00:39:38.220,00:39:42.940,"I told them about a decade ago,"
00:39:44.560,00:39:46.840,中国真的把欧洲当做战略伙伴,00:39:43.780,00:39:47.180,China sincerely believed Europe was our strategic partner
00:39:46.880,00:39:48.280,我们签了协议的,,,
00:39:49.160,00:39:51.080,让我们一起来共同发展,00:39:47.320,00:39:53.500,"and signed an agreement to develop the Galileo Plan together,"
00:39:51.080,00:39:52.480,叫伽利略计划,,,
00:39:52.480,00:39:53.960,咖喱六排,,,
00:39:54.480,00:39:57.640,欧洲的GPS定位系统,00:39:54.360,00:39:57.340,which was Europe's GPS system.
00:39:57.640,00:39:58.560,中国很认真,,,
00:39:58.560,00:39:59.880,钱都投进去了,00:39:57.500,00:39:59.660,China took it very seriously and invested money in it.
00:40:00.440,00:40:02.600,欧洲人给中国拼命的社开这个,00:40:00.240,00:40:04.900,But the Europeans set all the restrictions they could on China’s participation in the projects.
00:40:02.600,00:40:02.880,项目,,,
00:40:02.880,00:40:03.400,不能参加,,,
00:40:03.400,00:40:04.200,内部项目,,,
00:40:04.200,00:40:04.960,不能参加,,,
00:40:04.960,00:40:06.320,中国说我们自己盖了,00:40:04.900,00:40:06.540,"So, China decided to do it on our own."
00:40:06.720,00:40:09.080,现在我们的北斗远远零下,00:40:06.800,00:40:08.880,Now our BeiDou system is far ahead of the Galileo system.
00:40:09.520,00:40:10.280,那么我说,,,
00:40:10.320,00:40:12.080,你们不要再犯同样的错误,00:40:09.420,00:40:12.260,"I told them, “Don’t make the same mistake again!"""
00:40:12.160,00:40:14.440,我说卫东土委托,00:40:12.720,00:40:14.720,"""We don’t wait for you."""
00:40:15.720,00:40:16.520,我不等你们,00:40:14.900,00:40:16.900,"""We definitely don’t.”"
00:40:16.720,00:40:17.160,真的我,,,
00:40:17.720,00:40:19.480,可就开走了我们高铁,00:40:17.440,00:40:20.220,"We're moving forward, on a high-speed train."
00:40:19.520,00:40:19.920,对,,,
00:40:20.040,00:40:20.520,对,,,
00:40:20.640,00:40:21.280,速度非常,00:40:20.220,00:40:21.300,We go fast.
00:40:21.320,00:40:21.960,我觉得,,,
00:40:22.000,00:40:22.920,其实,,,
00:40:22.960,00:40:24.480,偶对中国的这种不理解,00:40:21.560,00:40:26.780,"I think their continued incomprehension
of China is their loss of soft power."
00:40:24.520,00:40:27.200,其实就是他们软实力的一种丧失,,,
00:40:27.240,00:40:29.320,像最近这半年,,,
00:40:29.320,00:40:31.320,有一些西方国家领导人,00:40:27.160,00:40:31.520,"In the past six months, some Western countries had criticisms on China,"
00:40:31.320,00:40:32.200,对中国的指责,,,
00:40:32.240,00:40:33.680,包括对一带一路的指责,00:40:31.520,00:40:33.840,"including on the Belt and Road Initiative,"
00:40:33.720,00:40:35.600,但是很多非洲国家领导人,,,
00:40:35.680,00:40:36.440,很快,00:40:34.020,00:40:38.380,"but many African and Asian countries, retorted promptly that"
00:40:36.480,00:40:37.160,包括亚洲,,,
00:40:37.200,00:40:38.240,国家很快过来返,,,
00:40:38.320,00:40:39.120,魔说我们,,,
00:40:39.160,00:40:39.960,门有我们自己,,,
00:40:40.000,00:40:40.920,以的理解我们,00:40:38.440,00:40:42.640,"they have their own understanding [of the initiative], and
that they have their own observations and judgments."
00:40:40.960,00:40:42.520,我们自己的判断和眼睛,,,
00:40:42.720,00:40:43.240,应对,00:40:42.640,00:40:43.700,Yes.
00:40:43.480,00:40:43.840,对,,,
00:40:43.880,00:40:45.840,包括最近大家热议的华为事件,00:40:44.040,00:40:45.720,"The heatedly discussed Huawei incident,"
00:40:45.840,00:40:46.880,其实某种程度上,,,
00:40:46.880,00:40:47.880,也是反映出了一种,00:40:45.720,00:40:49.780,"to some extent, reflects the emotional stress among Chinese people."
00:40:47.880,00:40:49.880,情绪上的这种波动,,,
00:40:49.880,00:40:50.800,越到这个时候,,,
00:40:50.800,00:40:52.200,中国越是要淡定,00:40:50.060,00:40:53.500,China must keep calm and stick to its strategic plan.
00:40:52.200,00:40:53.600,要有自己的格局,,,
00:40:53.880,00:40:55.840,我国目前有很多政策,00:40:54.000,00:40:55.640,"Now, the Chinese government has many policies"
00:40:55.840,00:40:58.760,其实是鼓励我国的中小民营企业,00:40:55.640,00:41:01.080,"to invigorate private small and medium-sized
enterprises [SMEs] for greater market participation."
00:40:58.760,00:40:59.720,提高自己的活力,,,
00:40:59.720,00:41:01.040,然后走向市场的,,,
00:41:01.160,00:41:03.040,但是同时又有一些监管政策,00:41:01.200,00:41:03.140,"But at the same time, there are regulatory policies,"
00:41:03.080,00:41:04.360,比如说去杠杆,,,
00:41:04.360,00:41:06.560,还有环保限产政策等等,00:41:03.140,00:41:06.400,"such as deleveraging and environmental restrictions,"
00:41:06.640,00:41:08.160,这些政策在执行的过程中,,,
00:41:08.160,00:41:11.040,可能对似乎对国企影响不大,00:41:06.800,00:41:11.960,which are implemented to affect private SMEs much more negatively
00:41:11.040,00:41:12.920,但是却对这些中小民营企业,,,
00:41:12.960,00:41:15.280,产生了一些造成的伤害,00:41:11.960,00:41:15.300,than state-owned enterprises.
00:41:15.360,00:41:16.760,想请教一下,,,
00:41:16.760,00:41:18.000,您是如何看待,00:41:15.980,00:41:19.820,I'd like to hear your opinion on this contradiction.
00:41:18.000,00:41:20.160,这种政策与导向之间的矛盾,00:41:21.720,00:41:23.260,China Now
00:41:21.720,00:41:25.320,这就是中间可以互相讨论辩论,00:41:23.260,00:41:25.260,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:41:26.000,00:41:28.080,我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:41:26.100,00:41:28.100,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:41:28.520,00:41:30.080,中国人你要自信,00:41:28.680,00:41:30.680,"China, be confident."
00:41:31.680,00:41:33.400,这就是中国,,,
00:41:33.400,00:41:35.280,听张维为说,00:41:31.780,00:41:35.440,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:41:36.560,00:41:37.800,都有一些监管政策,00:41:36.420,00:41:39.040,"But at the same time, there are regulatory policies,"
00:41:37.800,00:41:39.080,比如说去杠杆,,,
00:41:39.120,00:41:41.240,还有环保限产政策等等,00:41:39.040,00:41:41.280,"such as deleveraging and environmental restrictions,"
00:41:41.280,00:41:43.120,似乎对国企影响不大,,,
00:41:43.120,00:41:45.040,但是却对这些中小民营企业,00:41:41.280,00:41:47.540,which are implemented to affect private SMEs much more negatively than state-owned enterprises.
00:41:45.080,00:41:46.400,造成了一些伤害,,,
00:41:46.480,00:41:48.080,想请教一下,,,
00:41:48.080,00:41:49.320,您是如何看待,,,
00:41:49.320,00:41:51.040,这种政策与导向之间的矛盾,00:41:47.760,00:41:51.340,I'd like to hear your opinion on this contradiction.
00:41:51.080,00:41:52.120,问对,,,
00:41:52.160,00:41:54.480,首先我完全理解,00:41:52.000,00:41:55.500,I totally understand your question about this contradiction.
00:41:54.480,00:41:55.800,您讲这个问题,,,
00:41:55.800,00:41:57.320,因为我们最近在,,,
00:41:58.480,00:42:00.920,昆山我们做了一个小小的调研,00:41:56.740,00:42:00.780,"Recently, we did a small study in Kunshan"
00:42:00.920,00:42:02.640,我们就发现这样的问题,00:42:00.780,00:42:03.000,and we saw this contradiction as well.
00:42:03.960,00:42:06.080,这个就是我刚才讲了,,,
00:42:06.080,00:42:08.560,中国经济模式的混合经济模式,00:42:03.580,00:42:08.580,This is the China model—the mixed economy model I talked about.
00:42:08.560,00:42:09.960,从宏观上讲,00:42:08.840,00:42:10.840,"In terms of our macroeconomic strategy,"
00:42:09.960,00:42:10.800,战略上讲,,,
00:42:10.840,00:42:11.800,我们希望,,,
00:42:11.840,00:42:12.920,民营经济,,,
00:42:12.920,00:42:13.600,国有经济,,,
00:42:13.600,00:42:14.720,两个板块,00:42:11.040,00:42:16.640,"we hope that the private economy can complement
the state-owned economy with different functions,"
00:42:14.800,00:42:15.520,高度的,,,
00:42:15.640,00:42:16.080,府,,,
00:42:16.120,00:42:17.800,他们各自有功能的区分,,,
00:42:18.680,00:42:22.160,然后实现一种良性的互动和互补,00:42:17.040,00:42:21.680,and have positive interactions between the two sectors.
00:42:22.160,00:42:25.240,但在实际操作中是有矛盾的,00:42:21.980,00:42:26.340,"But in practice, there are contradictions and troubles from time to time."
00:42:25.240,00:42:26.440,有时候是有问题的,,,
00:42:26.440,00:42:27.680,那么中央现在你看,,,
00:42:27.680,00:42:28.280,习近平主席,,,
00:42:28.280,00:42:30.320,这次民营企业座谈会,00:42:26.500,00:42:32.040,"President Xi Jinping answered this question in the
central government's forum for private enterprises."
00:42:30.600,00:42:32.320,就结余您讲这个问题的,,,
00:42:32.440,00:42:34.440,就在我们去杠杆的过程中,00:42:32.500,00:42:34.500,"In the process of deleveraging,"
00:42:34.440,00:42:37.000,我们很多地方做法一刀切,00:42:34.500,00:42:37.020,many local governments take the one-size-fits-all approach.
00:42:37.760,00:42:39.560,严格讲就不实事求是,00:42:37.200,00:42:40.140,"In technical terms, this is not “seeking truth from facts”."
00:42:39.560,00:42:40.280,知道吗,,,
00:42:40.400,00:42:41.440,有些企业,,,
00:42:42.160,00:42:43.480,他是比方说,00:42:40.640,00:42:45.820,"For example, some enterprises were able to meet the environmental standards,"
00:42:43.520,00:42:44.720,在环保问题上,,,
00:42:44.760,00:42:45.960,它是达标的,,,
00:42:46.000,00:42:46.720,地方政府,,,
00:42:46.720,00:42:47.160,它为了,,,
00:42:47.800,00:42:48.440,事情,,,
00:42:48.480,00:42:49.080,简单,00:42:46.060,00:42:51.300,"but the local government closed the whole
industry to save themselves some trouble."
00:42:49.320,00:42:50.720,他多一事不如少一事,,,
00:42:50.720,00:42:52.040,干就这样做了,,,
00:42:52.160,00:42:54.280,那么这就现在要纠正,00:42:52.320,00:42:54.320,This should be corrected.
00:42:54.520,00:42:55.320,中国模式,,,
00:42:55.320,00:42:56.120,特点是这样的,00:42:54.680,00:42:58.040,The China model is not perfect yet.
00:42:56.880,00:42:58.520,它不是十全十美,,,
00:42:58.560,00:42:59.360,但是,,,
00:42:59.600,00:43:00.440,如果真的,,,
00:43:01.000,00:43:02.000,发生问题的时候,00:42:58.320,00:43:04.700,"But when we find problems, we improve the model."
00:43:02.000,00:43:04.680,他会及时调整,,,
00:43:04.720,00:43:06.400,这是中国模式特点,00:43:04.700,00:43:06.360,This is its characteristic.
00:43:06.720,00:43:08.000,实际上民营企业自己,,,
00:43:08.000,00:43:08.720,也要有一个,,,
00:43:09.240,00:43:10.760,对宏观大局的把握,00:43:06.780,00:43:11.020,Private enterprises should also understand the big picture themselves.
00:43:10.800,00:43:11.080,握,,,
00:43:11.080,00:43:12.760,因为习近平,,,
00:43:12.800,00:43:13.520,主政以来,,,
00:43:13.560,00:43:14.840,他非常重视,00:43:11.240,00:43:16.800,"President Xi has attached great importance to improving
the quality of the economy since his presidency."
00:43:15.440,00:43:17.120,提高经济的质量,,,
00:43:17.600,00:43:19.720,这上也是一种新的机遇,00:43:16.900,00:43:19.640,This is actually a new opportunity for private enterprises.
00:43:20.160,00:43:20.720,就我们,,,
00:43:20.760,00:43:21.840,有一部分民营企业,,,
00:43:21.880,00:43:23.640,他不太想就是进,,,
00:43:23.680,00:43:24.240,一部,00:43:20.900,00:43:27.840,"Some private enterprises refuse to
upgrade themselves further in the value chain."
00:43:24.840,00:43:26.000,我们叫穆阿平的my,,,
00:43:26.000,00:43:28.200,刘庆在价值链上往上走,,,
00:43:28.200,00:43:28.760,所以民营企业,,,
00:43:28.800,00:43:30.320,也有个转型的问题,00:43:27.840,00:43:30.300,This shows challenges in the transformation of private enterprises
00:43:30.320,00:43:32.440,它有一个与时俱进的问题,00:43:30.300,00:43:32.280,and the mindset of “keeping up with the times”.
00:43:32.840,00:43:33.160,好,,,
