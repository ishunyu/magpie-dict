00:00:00.640,00:00:02.000,中国抗议模式,,,
00:00:02.000,00:00:04.680,就是构建人类命运共同体,00:00:01.140,00:00:05.180,"China's approach to fight the coronavirus is practicing
our belief that ""humanity is a community of shared future""."
00:00:04.720,00:00:05.600,实际行动,,,
00:00:05.640,00:00:07.160,我因为您还在前线工作,00:00:05.860,00:00:07.620,You are working on the front line.
00:00:07.160,00:00:09.000,现在您的感受是什么,00:00:07.620,00:00:08.900,How do you feel?
00:00:09.040,00:00:10.200,到了我们前线之后,,,
00:00:10.200,00:00:11.360,我们只有一个角色,00:00:09.140,00:00:12.560,"We only have one role on the front line.
We are the fighters."
00:00:11.360,00:00:12.360,那就是战士,,,
00:00:12.480,00:00:13.440,为什么,,,
00:00:13.560,00:00:15.440,谈德赛站出来为我们说话,00:00:12.560,00:00:15.600,Why would Tedros Adhanom speak out for China?
00:00:16.000,00:00:18.960,是因为他们这些专家,,,
00:00:18.960,00:00:20.280,深深的感觉到,00:00:16.140,00:00:24.460,"Experts like him felt that China has done more than the
general requirement for epidemic prevention."
00:00:20.800,00:00:21.520,中国做得,,,
00:00:21.520,00:00:22.360,实际上已经,,,
00:00:22.480,00:00:24.800,超过了一般的防疫要求,,,
00:00:24.840,00:00:25.440,愁了,,,
00:00:25.480,00:00:28.800,这就是中国请张维为说,00:00:25.660,00:00:30.340,"China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:00:34.120,00:00:35.080,又是中国,,,
00:00:35.480,00:00:37.120,由新冠病毒引发的肺炎,,,
00:00:37.160,00:00:37.560,一起,00:00:35.500,00:00:39.140,"While we are still challenged by the
2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19),"
00:00:37.600,00:00:38.480,现在还在,,,
00:00:38.520,00:00:39.080,持续中,,,
00:00:39.120,00:00:40.200,但是我们看到,,,
00:00:40.200,00:00:42.120,湖北已经进入了,00:00:39.140,00:00:42.880,we see that Hubei Province is coming to the final stage of the battle
00:00:42.160,00:00:43.000,决战的阶段,,,
00:00:43.040,00:00:44.840,而在湖北以外的地区,,,
00:00:44.840,00:00:46.080,确诊的病例数,00:00:43.140,00:00:47.380,"and the number of confirmed cases in
other regions continues to go down."
00:00:46.080,00:00:47.600,也在持续的下降,,,
00:00:47.600,00:00:49.520,让大家看到了希望,00:00:47.640,00:00:49.820,We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
00:00:49.840,00:00:51.360,而这样的一个结果,,,
00:00:51.400,00:00:52.640,是中国各行各业,00:00:50.080,00:00:54.548,"This couldn't have been possible without
the effort made by all the industries"
00:00:52.680,00:00:54.000,在过去的一段时间,,,
00:00:54.000,00:00:55.120,持续奋战,,,
00:00:55.160,00:00:56.080,也是我们老百姓,00:00:54.548,00:00:56.840,and the cooperation from all the people.
00:00:56.120,00:00:58.480,高度配合所迎来的,,,
00:00:58.720,00:01:00.840,就像世卫组织的总干事,00:00:57.240,00:01:02.020,"Just as the director general of WHO
Tedros Adhanom has said,"
00:01:00.840,00:01:02.040,谭德赛说的,,,
00:01:02.040,00:01:03.440,中国应对肺炎疫情,,,
00:01:03.480,00:01:04.320,速度之快,00:01:02.020,00:01:06.500,"""The high speed and massive scale of
China's moves are rarely seen in the world."""
00:01:04.320,00:01:05.360,规模之大,,,
00:01:05.400,00:01:06.880,世所罕见,,,
00:01:06.920,00:01:08.800,中国也为世界打赢,,,
00:01:08.840,00:01:10.040,肺炎疫情的战争,00:01:06.780,00:01:11.700,"""The steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at
its source appear to have bought the world time."""
00:01:10.040,00:01:12.080,赢得了宝贵的时间,,,
00:01:12.600,00:01:15.240,我想今天我们在这里一起来讨论,00:01:12.640,00:01:15.160,"Today, we are here to discuss and compare"
00:01:15.240,00:01:17.480,在应对突发疫情的情况下,00:01:15.540,00:01:19.180,how China and other countries respond to disease outbreaks.
00:01:17.480,00:01:19.120,中外模式的一些比较,,,
00:01:19.120,00:01:20.680,另外我们也将会来进行,,,
00:01:21.120,00:01:22.080,也就是各个国家,,,
00:01:22.080,00:01:24.080,在公共卫生体系建设方面,00:01:19.440,00:01:24.940,"We will also talk about how different
countries develop their public health systems."
00:01:24.080,00:01:25.560,是怎样的情况,,,
00:01:25.600,00:01:26.720,我们现场两位嘉宾,00:01:25.700,00:01:27.340,We have two guests today.
00:01:26.800,00:01:27.840,一位是复旦大学,,,
00:01:27.840,00:01:29.120,中国研究院的院长,,,
00:01:29.120,00:01:30.360,张维为教授,00:01:27.340,00:01:32.500,"Professor Zhang Weiwei, Director of
the China Institute of Fudan University."
00:01:30.360,00:01:33.000,还有一位是上海交通大学医学院,,,
00:01:33.000,00:01:34.680,公共卫生学院的副教授,00:01:32.720,00:01:36.275,"Professor Cai Yuyang, Associate Professor at
School of Public Health of Shanghai Jiao Tong University."
00:01:34.720,00:01:35.520,蔡雨洋,,,
00:01:35.520,00:01:36.480,欢迎两位,,,
00:01:36.520,00:01:38.120,那么因为是特别节目的形式,00:01:36.660,00:01:39.720,"This is a special episode where
 we don't have a live audience."
00:01:38.280,00:01:40.080,我们现场没有观众,,,
00:01:40.120,00:01:42.480,首先我会请张教授来,00:01:40.240,00:01:43.680,We will begin with a keynote speech from Professor Zhang
00:01:42.600,00:01:43.720,阐述他的观点,,,
00:01:43.720,00:01:45.080,然后我跟两位嘉宾,,,
00:01:45.080,00:01:46.720,会进入圆桌讨论,00:01:43.800,00:01:46.660,and then have a roundtable discussion with our guests.
00:01:46.720,00:01:46.920,好,,,
00:01:46.920,00:01:48.320,首先有请张教授,00:01:46.860,00:01:49.620,"Professor Zhang, please."
00:01:52.160,00:01:53.280,突如其来的疫情,,,
00:01:53.320,00:01:57.000,情是一场人类的共同的灾难,00:01:51.940,00:01:56.540,The sudden outbreak of the disease is a disaster for everyone.
00:01:57.360,00:01:58.920,国际社会团结一致,,,
00:01:58.920,00:02:00.200,共同应对,00:01:57.540,00:02:02.140,"International unity and collective response
is ""the right path for humanity to follow""."
00:02:00.200,00:02:02.360,才是人间正道,,,
00:02:02.840,00:02:06.000,但西方有一些幸灾乐祸的人,00:02:02.860,00:02:05.780,"However, some western media are gloating about the situation"
00:02:06.160,00:02:09.360,借疫情散布各种谬论,00:02:05.960,00:02:08.960,and taking this chance to spread their fallacies.
00:02:09.800,00:02:11.000,比方说,,,
00:02:11.000,00:02:13.760,美国一位冷战思维的学者,00:02:09.860,00:02:13.040,"An American scholar, in his cold-war mindset,"
00:02:14.040,00:02:16.360,在华尔街日报上撰文,,,
00:02:16.400,00:02:17.200,标题就是,00:02:13.820,00:02:19.360,"published ""China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia""
on Wall Street Journal."
00:02:17.200,00:02:19.840,中国是真正的东亚病夫,,,
00:02:20.360,00:02:22.960,法国皮卡尔信使报封面,,,
00:02:23.000,00:02:26.480,用的是阿拉很软的黄色警报,00:02:20.200,00:02:25.940,"The cover page of Courrier Picard says
""Alerte Jaune"" [Yellow Alert],"
00:02:26.520,00:02:29.600,用这个标题来影射惶惑,00:02:26.860,00:02:29.440,"implying this is a ""yellow disaster""."
00:02:30.040,00:02:33.200,美国商务部长罗丝公开对媒体说,00:02:30.080,00:02:33.320,"US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross
openly said to the press that"
00:02:33.200,00:02:34.400,这场疫情,,,
00:02:34.400,00:02:37.000,将有助于制造业就业机会,00:02:33.440,00:02:37.720,"the coronavirus could help the United States
bring back jobs and manufacturing."
00:02:37.080,00:02:38.360,回流到美国,,,
00:02:38.960,00:02:40.200,但所有这些观点,,,
00:02:40.240,00:02:43.480,都立即引来了国际舆论的哗然,00:02:38.700,00:02:43.080,"All these views immediately caused
an uproar in the international press."
00:02:43.880,00:02:46.840,引起了国内外有识之士的抗议和,00:02:43.980,00:02:47.340,"There have been many insightful
protests and rebuttal home and abroad."
00:02:46.840,00:02:47.680,反驳,,,
00:02:47.840,00:02:49.720,因为多数人都认为,,,
00:02:49.800,00:02:51.240,人类文明的底线,00:02:47.660,00:02:52.360,"The majority do not tolerate such tramples on
the bottom line of human civilization."
00:02:51.240,00:02:52.880,是不容践踏的,,,
00:02:53.440,00:02:55.040,那么即使在经济层面,00:02:53.500,00:02:55.200,"In terms of economy,"
00:02:55.800,00:02:57.560,诺贝尔经济学奖获得者,00:02:55.560,00:02:58.875,"Paul Krugman, recipient of the
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences,"
00:02:57.600,00:02:58.920,保罗克鲁格曼,,,
00:02:58.920,00:02:59.560,也批评,,,
00:02:59.600,00:03:01.600,美国商务部长罗丝,00:02:58.880,00:03:01.680,"also criticized Wilbur Ross, saying that"
00:03:01.920,00:03:04.840,他说疫情对美国经济没有任何,00:03:02.020,00:03:05.180,the coronavirus isn’t good for America.
00:03:04.840,00:03:05.680,好处,,,
00:03:06.080,00:03:08.000,即便他不夺走你的生命,,,
00:03:08.000,00:03:10.320,它也可能夺走你的工作,00:03:06.200,00:03:09.980,"""Even if it doesn’t kill you, it might kill your job."""
00:03:10.800,00:03:14.040,他说03年非典爆发的时候,00:03:10.740,00:03:13.800,"He said when SARS broke out in China in 2003,"
00:03:14.040,00:03:15.480,中国的制造业,,,
00:03:15.480,00:03:18.280,只占全球制造业的8%,00:03:13.900,00:03:17.780,China only accounted for 8% of global manufacturing.
00:03:18.600,00:03:19.680,今天占到了,,,
00:03:19.680,00:03:21.880,全球制造业的1/4,00:03:18.680,00:03:21.540,"Today, however, China accounts for a quarter of global manufacturing."
00:03:22.240,00:03:24.600,如果中国的制造业受到打击,00:03:22.000,00:03:25.840,"If the virus disrupts Chinese production,
America's economy will be seriously inflicted."
00:03:24.600,00:03:25.240,美国,,,
00:03:25.280,00:03:26.680,深受其害,,,
00:03:26.960,00:03:29.480,所以他认为罗斯的观点是愚蠢,00:03:26.760,00:03:29.280,"He said that was Wilbur Ross’s ""boneheaded remarks""."
00:03:30.120,00:03:31.640,其实今天的世界经济,,,
00:03:31.640,00:03:33.160,早已是密切联系的,00:03:29.940,00:03:35.740,"Today we live in a world of global value chains.
The failure of one link will fail all."
00:03:33.160,00:03:34.080,一个整体,,,
00:03:34.080,00:03:35.080,一损俱损,,,
00:03:35.120,00:03:36.160,一荣俱荣,,,
00:03:36.520,00:03:38.360,比方说美国财富杂志,,,
00:03:38.360,00:03:39.240,不久前,,,
00:03:39.240,00:03:40.480,刊文感叹,,,
00:03:40.520,00:03:41.800,今天几乎所有的,00:03:36.620,00:03:44.480,"Fortune Magazine posted that the manufacturing of
almost all consumer electronics depends on China."
00:03:41.800,00:03:43.520,重要的消费电子产品,,,
00:03:43.520,00:03:44.800,都依赖中国,,,
00:03:45.240,00:03:47.720,中国iPhone工厂复工推迟,00:03:45.020,00:03:48.420,"When the iPhone manufacturers in China delayed return of workers,"
00:03:47.720,00:03:48.320,的报道,,,
00:03:48.320,00:03:51.680,使苹果市值跌掉270亿美元,00:03:48.420,00:03:51.420,it shaved US$ 27 billion off Apple's stock market value.
00:03:51.840,00:03:54.440,湖北是全球汽车零配件,00:03:51.780,00:03:55.360,Hubei Province is a key supplier for global auto parts.
00:03:54.440,00:03:55.920,供应的关键区域,,,
00:03:55.920,00:03:57.400,全球汽车产业,,,
00:03:57.400,00:03:59.400,掀起了一场停产危机,00:03:56.100,00:03:59.040,"Because of the epidemic, the global
auto industry is facing factory shutdowns."
00:03:59.600,00:04:00.680,从日产,,,
00:04:00.760,00:04:02.320,到韩国现代公司,00:03:59.445,00:04:02.585,It halts production of Nissan and Hyundai Korea
00:04:02.360,00:04:04.760,都因为中国供应的零部件短缺,00:04:02.585,00:04:05.935,due to the low supply of auto parts.
00:04:04.760,00:04:06.000,而受重创,,,
00:04:06.560,00:04:08.920,德国现在近1/3的企业,00:04:06.435,00:04:09.615,Nearly a third of German companies encountered supply shortage
00:04:08.920,00:04:10.680,遇到供货的问题,,,
00:04:11.040,00:04:12.440,连美国的药品供应,00:04:11.025,00:04:13.665,and even the drug supply in the U.S. has been impacted.
00:04:12.480,00:04:14.120,现在也出现了危机,,,
00:04:14.120,00:04:16.120,美国使用的抗生素,00:04:14.125,00:04:17.065,Most of the antibiotics used in the United States come from China.
00:04:16.120,00:04:18.920,大部分来自中国胰岛素,,,
00:04:18.960,00:04:20.400,抗抑郁药物,,,
00:04:20.600,00:04:22.080,血液稀释剂等等,00:04:17.660,00:04:23.840,"Insulin, antidepressants, blood thinners, etc.
directly or indirectly rely on China's supply chain."
00:04:22.080,00:04:24.000,都直接或间接的依赖中国的,,,
00:04:24.000,00:04:24.480,供应链,,,
00:04:24.480,00:04:26.320,所以金融时报认为,,,
00:04:26.360,00:04:28.200,除非中国恢复生产,,,
00:04:28.240,00:04:31.320,否则许多国家药企的供应链,00:04:25.020,00:04:33.620,"Financial Times believed that many countries would
run out of drugs if China failed to resume production."
00:04:31.400,00:04:33.880,药企的供应将很快耗尽,,,
00:04:34.480,00:04:35.800,美国一些势力,,,
00:04:36.080,00:04:37.800,企图借这次疫情,00:04:34.440,00:04:39.720,"Some Americans advocacy groups are trying to decouple
the US economy from China amid the COVID-19 outbreak."
00:04:37.880,00:04:38.840,是美国经济,,,
00:04:38.840,00:04:39.920,中国脱钩,,,
00:04:39.920,00:04:41.360,这谈何努力,00:04:40.100,00:04:41.420,That's easier said than done.
00:04:41.480,00:04:43.280,中国过去数十年的开放,,,
00:04:43.280,00:04:46.160,是一种嵌入世界经济体系的开放,00:04:41.540,00:04:45.240,"China's opening up has embedded our
economy in the world economic system."
00:04:46.440,00:04:47.320,中国早已是,,,
00:04:47.320,00:04:48.760,全球制造业,00:04:46.240,00:04:50.140,"China has long been a key link in the
industry chain of global manufacturing."
00:04:48.760,00:04:50.840,产业链的关键环节,,,
00:04:51.120,00:04:52.280,虽然过去几年,,,
00:04:52.280,00:04:54.880,也有跨国公司生产线迁出中国,00:04:50.940,00:04:55.060,"Although the production lines of multinational
companies have also moved out of China in the past few years,"
00:04:54.920,00:04:57.400,但大家都是巷子鞋,,,
00:04:57.680,00:04:58.560,诚意生产,00:04:55.420,00:04:59.960,"most of them are short production lines
such as shoe and clothing production."
00:04:58.600,00:05:01.240,将产业链非常短的生产线,,,
00:05:01.480,00:05:02.200,像中国这样,,,
00:05:02.200,00:05:03.880,具有世界最完整的,,,
00:05:03.880,00:05:06.120,超复杂的产业链的经济体,00:05:00.620,00:05:07.360,"Economies like China with internationally
complete and complex industrial chain are rare."
00:05:06.120,00:05:07.680,全球难觅,,,
00:05:07.920,00:05:08.760,更何况中国,,,
00:05:08.800,00:05:09.480,还是事实上,00:05:07.760,00:05:10.800,"Moreover, China is the world’s largest consumer market."
00:05:09.480,00:05:11.160,世界最大的消费市场,,,
00:05:11.600,00:05:13.040,我认为只要艺情,,,
00:05:13.040,00:05:14.520,在不太长的时间内,00:05:11.580,00:05:17.000,"I believe that as long as the epidemic ends in a short
period of time, which we are hopeful about,"
00:05:14.560,00:05:16.040,结束曙光,,,
00:05:16.040,00:05:16.720,我们看到,,,
00:05:17.480,00:05:19.320,中国在全球产业链中的,00:05:17.460,00:05:21.180,China’s position in the global value chain will not be shaken.
00:05:19.360,00:05:20.160,关键地位,,,
00:05:20.160,00:05:21.240,是无法撼动,,,
00:05:21.280,00:05:21.600,的,,,
00:05:22.040,00:05:23.920,我认为中国一定能够打好,,,
00:05:23.960,00:05:26.520,正在展开的这场经济保卫战,00:05:22.040,00:05:26.220,I also believe that China will do well in defending our economy.
00:05:27.480,00:05:29.080,那么在绝大多数国家,,,
00:05:29.120,00:05:32.400,都支持中国抗议举措的时候,00:05:27.220,00:05:32.340,"While most countries are supportive of
China’s disease control measures,"
00:05:32.400,00:05:34.320,美国居然有人指责,,,
00:05:34.320,00:05:35.920,中国采取的严防,00:05:32.800,00:05:37.700,"some in America accused China's measures
being violations of human rights."
00:05:35.960,00:05:37.040,严控的措施,,,
00:05:37.040,00:05:38.400,是侵犯人权,,,
00:05:38.720,00:05:41.840,比方说美国亚利桑那州立大学,00:05:38.480,00:05:44.180,"James Hodge, Director of the Center for Public Health
Law and Policy at Arizona State University,"
00:05:41.840,00:05:44.200,公共卫生法律政策中心,,,
00:05:44.200,00:05:45.360,怎么的获取,,,
00:05:45.480,00:05:47.000,他就说中国的风尘,00:05:45.320,00:05:48.580,said locking down cities in China is a human-rights violation.
00:05:47.200,00:05:48.720,导致侵犯人权,,,
00:05:49.120,00:05:50.360,另外美国学者呼吁,,,
00:05:50.360,00:05:51.160,关注中国,,,
00:05:51.160,00:05:53.440,采取隔离检疫,00:05:49.200,00:05:54.820,"There are also American scholars calling for attention to
the so-called ""dark side"" of China's quarantine."
00:05:53.480,00:05:55.240,叫所谓的阴暗面,,,
00:05:55.920,00:05:58.280,纽约时报甚至在文称,,,
00:05:58.280,00:05:59.720,新冠病毒危机,00:05:55.940,00:06:01.520,"The New York Times published ""Coronavirus Crisis
Shows China's Governance Failure""."
00:05:59.720,00:06:00.080,暴露,,,
00:06:00.080,00:06:02.000,中国治理体系的失败,,,
00:06:02.200,00:06:03.680,结果连新加坡总理,,,
00:06:03.720,00:06:04.640,李显龙的夫人,,,
00:06:04.640,00:06:05.360,何晶女士,00:06:02.080,00:06:07.820,"This even made the Singapore PM's wife, Ho Ching to voice on social media"
00:06:05.360,00:06:06.520,也看不下去了,,,
00:06:06.520,00:06:08.240,他发生他质疑,,,
00:06:08.240,00:06:10.560,如果中国治理体系失败,,,
00:06:10.560,00:06:13.080,那么美国流感死亡案例,00:06:08.580,00:06:13.700,“What about the influenza B deaths in the USA?”
00:06:13.080,00:06:13.520,这么多,,,
00:06:13.560,00:06:14.480,又暴露了什么,,,
00:06:15.240,00:06:17.400,美国疾病控制预防中心,00:06:15.280,00:06:18.460,The U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported that
00:06:17.400,00:06:20.360,它的CDC截至今年1月25报,,,
00:06:20.360,00:06:20.920,的报告,,,
00:06:20.920,00:06:23.320,估计从去年10月1号开始,00:06:18.940,00:06:22.960,"from 1 Oct 2019 to 25 Jan 2020,"
00:06:23.360,00:06:25.840,也就是三个月不到的时间内,00:06:23.220,00:06:25.240,"less than three months,"
00:06:25.960,00:06:27.240,美国的流感季,,,
00:06:27.240,00:06:30.520,已导致至少一千九百万人,00:06:26.060,00:06:35.340,"the flu has caused at least 19 million infections,
10 thousand deaths, including at least 68 children."
00:06:30.920,00:06:31.960,感染流感,,,
00:06:31.960,00:06:33.400,至少一万人次,,,
00:06:33.400,00:06:36.000,甚至包括了至少六十八名儿童,,,
00:06:36.480,00:06:38.840,西方媒体这一轮鼓噪,00:06:36.300,00:06:39.060,Some western media have been banging the drum
00:06:39.200,00:06:40.120,再次印证了,,,
00:06:40.120,00:06:41.240,我们这个节目,00:06:39.300,00:06:42.520,and that proves what I've said a lot on China Now —
00:06:41.240,00:06:42.920,经常提及的一个观点,,,
00:06:43.120,00:06:44.280,也就是在西方,,,
00:06:44.320,00:06:45.800,还有那么一些偏执狂,00:06:43.200,00:06:48.320,"that is, there are still people holding on to the bigotry
that everything China does is wrong."
00:06:45.800,00:06:47.240,他在他们眼里,,,
00:06:47.240,00:06:49.120,中国怎么做都是错的,,,
00:06:49.120,00:06:51.120,你控制疫情是违反人权,00:06:48.840,00:06:51.395,"""It's a human right violation if you control the disease,"
00:06:51.400,00:06:53.640,你疫情失控是治理失败,00:06:51.400,00:06:53.620,"and a governance failure if it's out of control."""
00:06:54.160,00:06:55.720,所以我们的结论很简单,00:06:53.960,00:06:57.035,Our conclusion is very simple—just ignore them.
00:06:55.720,00:06:56.960,不要理睬他们,,,
00:06:57.080,00:06:59.160,就像鲁迅先生当年所说的,,,
00:06:59.240,00:07:00.400,鄙视这样的人,00:06:57.280,00:07:01.940,"Just as Mr. Lu Xun said, ""Don't even bother to roll your eyes."""
00:07:00.680,00:07:02.720,连眼珠子也不转过去,,,
00:07:02.880,00:07:04.920,我们该做什么就做什么,00:07:02.680,00:07:05.000,Do what we ought to do.
00:07:05.200,00:07:06.360,坦率的说,,,
00:07:06.640,00:07:08.120,碰到这样的疫情,00:07:05.320,00:07:10.880,"Frankly speaking, the Western systems would not
be able to cope with such an outbreak."
00:07:08.120,00:07:10.160,西方模式根本无法应对,,,
00:07:10.160,00:07:10.960,他怎么应对,,,
00:07:10.960,00:07:12.960,你只要看一下澳大利亚,,,
00:07:13.240,00:07:14.240,和美国加州,00:07:11.560,00:07:16.180,"You can look at how Australia and California
responded to forest fires last year,"
00:07:14.280,00:07:16.640,去年是如何应对森林大火的,,,
00:07:16.920,00:07:19.200,看一看美国是如何应对2005,,,
00:07:19.200,00:07:19.560,年,,,
00:07:19.560,00:07:21.280,卡特里娜飓风灾害,00:07:17.140,00:07:22.820,"how the United States responded to Hurricane Katrina in 2005,"
00:07:21.360,00:07:23.080,看看美国是如何应对,,,
00:07:23.200,00:07:25.840,2009年H1N1的病毒的,00:07:23.300,00:07:25.560,and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
00:07:26.560,00:07:28.080,在比较中国怎样应对,,,
00:07:28.080,00:07:29.680,08年的汶川地震,00:07:26.580,00:07:32.540,"And compare them to how China responded to
2008 Sichuan earthquake and the 2019 coronavirus."
00:07:29.680,00:07:31.360,和这次新官必读,,,
00:07:31.600,00:07:32.840,结论不研制,,,
00:07:33.720,00:07:36.960,中国这次采取了果断的应对措施,00:07:33.500,00:07:37.760,"China has taken decisive response measures this time
and achieved significant results."
00:07:36.960,00:07:38.840,效果显着赢得了,,,
00:07:38.880,00:07:41.600,世界绝大多数国家的理解和支持,00:07:38.200,00:07:41.160,"We won the understanding and support
of most countries in the world."
00:07:42.160,00:07:44.680,就像这次武汉迅速启动了,,,
00:07:44.680,00:07:46.360,10来个方舱医院,00:07:42.380,00:07:47.760,"Wuhan City launched over 10 shelter hospitals
to treat mild coronavirus cases"
00:07:46.360,00:07:48.400,收是轻症患者,,,
00:07:48.440,00:07:50.080,境外居然有人散布谣言,00:07:48.620,00:07:51.380,"but rumors in the West call them ""concentration camps""."
00:07:50.120,00:07:51.160,说这是集中营,,,
00:07:51.800,00:07:53.000,但方舱医院的患者,00:07:51.860,00:07:54.555,As the patients in the shelter hospitals started to
00:07:53.000,00:07:56.480,开始广场舞PK8段锦,00:07:54.560,00:07:58.080,"do square dance, Baduanjin qigong, Tai Chi, and radio calisthenics,"

00:07:57.280,00:07:58.600,广播体操,,,
00:07:58.600,00:08:00.560,把老外都看得眼花缭乱,00:07:58.620,00:08:00.800,"which were impressive to look at,"
00:08:00.600,00:08:02.440,而且出院的人越来越多,00:08:00.800,00:08:02.740,"and as more and more people were discharged,"
00:08:02.480,00:08:03.880,所谓集中营的谣言,,,
00:08:03.880,00:08:05.240,也就不攻自破了,00:08:02.740,00:08:05.180,the rumor soon became self-defeating.
00:08:06.080,00:08:07.440,那么2月12日的时候,,,
00:08:07.760,00:08:09.240,世界卫生组织,00:08:06.280,00:08:11.660,"The WHO Executive Board held a meeting on Feb 12 in Geneva,"

00:08:16.080,00:08:18.320,你为什么这么多次表扬中国,,,
00:08:18.360,00:08:19.600,是不是中国方面,00:08:16.100,00:08:21.080,"why he kept praising China and if the
Chinese government asked him to do that."
00:08:19.600,00:08:21.560,对你提出这样的要求,,,
00:08:21.920,00:08:22.800,谈得say这样回,,,
00:08:22.800,00:08:26.080,他说我们不需要取悦于任何人,00:08:21.540,00:08:25.600,"Tedros Adhanom said,

00:08:28.840,00:08:30.280,有两个目的,,,
00:08:30.400,00:08:32.000,一是鼓励这些国家,00:08:30.360,00:08:33.500,"one, to encourage these countries to continue their policies"
00:08:32.000,00:08:34.000,继续坚持正确的政策,,,
00:08:34.160,00:08:36.520,二是带动其他国家借鉴,00:08:34.200,00:08:37.840,"and two, to encourage other countries to learn from them."
00:08:36.560,00:08:38.280,学习他们的做法,,,

00:08:48.200,00:08:50.880,中国采取了大规模的措施,00:08:48.000,00:08:51.740,"and the reason is that China took action
massively at the epicenter Wuhan City."
00:08:50.920,00:08:52.000,应对疫情,,,

response to the 2009 H1N1 epidemic."
00:09:17.640,00:09:19.200, H 1N11情,,,
00:09:19.200,00:09:21.080,做一个具体的比较,,,
00:09:21.960,00:09:23.560,09年3月底的时候,,,

00:09:43.000,00:09:44.000,4月25号,,,
00:09:44.000,00:09:46.960,也就是美国发现DD样本后10,00:09:43.180,00:09:47.060,"April 25, which is 10 days after, the WHO declared"
00:09:46.960,00:09:47.560,天,,,
00:09:47.680,00:09:49.040,思维组织就宣布,,,
00:09:49.040,00:09:50.640, HN1疫情,,,
00:09:50.640,00:09:52.040,为国际关注的,00:09:48.040,00:09:53.920,"the H1N1 outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern"","
00:09:52.040,00:09:53.840,突发卫生公共事件,,,
00:09:54.840,00:09:56.960,但宣布分为几个级别,,,
00:09:56.960,00:09:58.240,逐步升高的,00:09:54.860,00:10:00.160,and it gradually rose to the highest level of phase 6 in June.
00:09:58.280,00:09:58.840,到6月,,,
00:09:58.840,00:10:00.800,就升至最高的第6级,,,
00:10:01.520,00:10:02.280,4月26日,,,
00:10:02.280,00:10:04.320,美国政府也宣布,00:10:01.700,00:10:06.800,"On April 26, the US government also
declared a public health emergency"
00:10:04.440,00:10:07.840,全国范围内的公共卫生紧急情况,,,
00:10:08.080,00:10:09.200,开始释放,,,
00:10:09.280,00:10:12.120,应对疫情的国家战略储备,00:10:07.840,00:10:11.840,and began to release strategic reserves in response to the emergency.
00:10:12.800,00:10:13.800,但令人遗憾的是,,,
00:10:13.800,00:10:14.840,总体上看,,,
00:10:14.840,00:10:16.440,美国的防控举措,00:10:13.000,00:10:18.060,"Regretfully, their prevention and control measures
did not produce much effect in general."
00:10:16.440,00:10:18.200,没有产生多大的效果,,,
00:10:18.480,00:10:21.040,未能阻止疫情的迅速蔓延,00:10:18.500,00:10:24.060,The epidemic was not contained and spread rapidly.
00:10:21.680,00:10:23.000,蔓延的速度非常之快,,,
00:10:23.000,00:10:24.000,三个月之后,,,
00:10:24.000,00:10:25.520,世卫组织就不再要求,,,
00:10:25.560,00:10:25.920,各国,,,
00:10:25.920,00:10:28.080,报送确切的数量,00:10:24.480,00:10:28.220,"After three months, the WHO stopped asking
the member states to report the actual numbers."
00:10:28.280,00:10:30.840,只能是统计多少算多少,00:10:28.380,00:10:30.420,They had to use whatever statistics was available.
00:10:31.000,00:10:32.600,疫情爆发后的6个月,,,
00:10:32.640,00:10:34.080,奥巴马总统宣布,00:10:30.760,00:10:35.940,"Six months after the outbreak, President Obama
declared H1N1 a national emergency"
00:10:34.080,00:10:36.520,美国进入全国紧急状态,,,
00:10:36.720,00:10:39.600,但此时疫情传播已完全失控,00:10:36.720,00:10:39.240,but the outbreak was already out of control.
00:10:40.160,00:10:41.960,直到第二年春夏之交,00:10:39.985,00:10:42.895,"It was not contained until the turn of
the spring and summer of the next year."
00:10:41.960,00:10:43.360,才被遏制住,,,
00:10:43.800,00:10:46.720,最终根本没有准确的疫情数据,00:10:43.585,00:10:45.955,There was no accurate data in the end.
00:10:46.840,00:10:49.360,美国疾控中心CDC只能通过,,,
00:10:49.360,00:10:50.080,模型,00:10:46.600,00:10:52.240,The CDC could only use model estimation to understand the situation.
00:10:50.120,00:10:52.600,推算美国的疫情状况,,,
00:10:52.840,00:10:55.000,从2009年4月12号,,,
00:10:55.040,00:10:56.800,到2010年4月10日,00:10:52.860,00:10:57.740,"From 12 April 2009 to 10 April 2010,"
00:10:56.800,00:10:58.200,这一年内,,,
00:10:58.360,00:10:59.920,估计美国发生了,,,
00:10:59.920,00:11:02.680,6080万例感染,00:10:58.140,00:11:02.180,"it was estimated 60.8 million people were infected,"
00:11:02.840,00:11:04.880,也就是美国人口的1/5,00:11:02.980,00:11:05.780,which was 1/5 of the US population.
00:11:04.880,00:11:06.160,受到了感染,,,
00:11:06.560,00:11:10.840,其中27.4万例住院治疗,,,
00:11:11.440,00:11:13.880,"12,469例死亡",00:11:06.480,00:11:18.580,"274,000 were hospitalized and 12,469 died,
which is 4.5% of the hospitalized cases."
00:11:15.120,00:11:16.440,那么住院人群中,,,
00:11:16.440,00:11:19.320,死亡比例是4.5%,,,
00:11:20.080,00:11:22.800,如果要把这个和中国的情况比较,00:11:19.740,00:11:22.755,"If we compare this to China,"
00:11:22.840,00:11:25.560,那么就把这些数字乘以400,00:11:22.760,00:11:28.140,"we should multiply these numbers by four because
China's population is over four times the America's."
00:11:25.560,00:11:27.400,因为中国的人口是美国的4倍,,,
00:11:27.400,00:11:28.160,还多一点,,,
00:11:28.560,00:11:31.640,这大概就等于2亿5000万人,00:11:28.480,00:11:31.240,"That would be about 250 million people infected,
which is over 10 times the Shanghai population."
00:11:31.640,00:11:32.120,感染,,,
00:11:32.160,00:11:34.600,也就至少是10个上海的人口被,,,
00:11:34.600,00:11:35.240,感染了,00:11:32.080,00:11:37.940,"1.1 million people would have been hospitalized,
and 50,000 would have died."
00:11:35.800,00:11:38.240,110万人住院5万人,,,
00:11:39.480,00:11:39.880,此外,,,
00:11:39.880,00:11:41.680,由于没有采取任何手段,,,
00:11:41.680,00:11:44.640,阻止疾病的国际传播,00:11:39.440,00:11:44.220,"In addition, because no measures were taken to
prevent the international spread of H1N1,"
00:11:44.880,00:11:47.560,结果到2012年底的时候,,,
00:11:47.560,00:11:49.280,H1N1一起,00:11:44.660,00:11:52.140,"it had spread to 214 countries and regions by the end of 2012,"
00:11:49.320,00:11:50.520,你传染到世界,,,
00:11:50.560,00:11:53.000,214个国家和地区,,,
00:11:53.080,00:11:55.640,导致全球多达28万,00:11:52.140,00:11:56.620,"killing an estimated 284,500 people worldwide."
00:11:55.640,00:11:57.360,4500人的死亡,,,
00:11:58.120,00:11:59.800,总之无论用什么标准,,,
00:11:59.840,00:12:00.200,看,,,
00:12:00.200,00:12:02.240,美国对这次疫情的应对,00:11:58.500,00:12:03.400,"By any standard, America's response to H1N1 was very unsuccessful."
00:12:02.280,00:12:03.920,都是相当失败的,,,
00:12:04.160,00:12:05.480,其失败的主要原因,00:12:04.280,00:12:06.420,Here's probably why.
00:12:05.480,00:12:07.200,大概有这么几个,,,
00:12:07.200,00:12:09.720,一个就是美国许多州的公共卫生,00:12:07.160,00:12:12.120,"First, public health resources in many states could not
cope with such a large-scale outbreak,"
00:12:09.720,00:12:10.240,资源,,,
00:12:10.240,00:12:12.840,无法应对这么大规模的疫情,,,
00:12:13.000,00:12:14.760,而联邦政府的跨州,,,
00:12:14.800,00:12:16.760,协调能力严重不足,00:12:13.100,00:12:17.000,"and the federal government's ability to
coordinate the states was seriously insufficient."
00:12:17.560,00:12:19.560,二是美国刚刚爆发了,00:12:17.300,00:12:20.180,"Second, America experienced the worst
post-WW2 financial crisis in 2008."
00:12:19.600,00:12:20.960,战后最严重的,,,
00:12:20.960,00:12:23.440,2008年的金融危机,00:12:20.980,00:12:25.620,"When companies were shutting down and employees were laid off,"
00:12:23.560,00:12:24.560,企业倒闭,,,
00:12:24.560,00:12:25.720,公司裁员,,,
00:12:25.720,00:12:27.120,政府根本没有财力,,,
00:12:27.120,00:12:28.920,来应对这样的突发疫情,00:12:26.340,00:12:29.600,"the government did not have enough
financial resources to cope with a sudden outbreak."
00:12:29.480,00:12:31.000,美国疫苗公司生产,,,
00:12:31.000,00:12:32.080,也远远没有达到,00:12:29.600,00:12:33.220,"The production of American vaccine companies
also fell far short of the targets."
00:12:32.120,00:12:34.000,原来设定的目标,,,
00:12:34.560,00:12:37.800,三是美国的政府和媒体的宣传,00:12:34.400,00:12:39.380,"Third, the US government and media
told the public that H1N1 had low mortality rate,"
00:12:37.800,00:12:39.440,这个病的致死率低,,,
00:12:39.440,00:12:42.280,使许多民众放松了警惕,00:12:40.020,00:12:42.020,which made people less vigilant.
00:12:42.680,00:12:45.480,第四就是美国的国际责任感,00:12:42.920,00:12:47.380,"Fourth, America had a serious lack of international responsibility."
00:12:45.480,00:12:46.840,是严重的缺乏,,,
00:12:48.080,00:12:50.560,那么美国应对这种,,,
00:12:50.560,00:12:52.440,大型传染疾病的做法,00:12:47.840,00:12:55.200,"The US government's approach to
this pandemic was, roughly speaking,"
00:12:52.440,00:12:53.720,用民间的讲法,,,
00:12:53.720,00:12:54.680,大概就这样,,,
00:12:55.440,00:12:56.800,我发个警示,,,
00:12:57.200,00:12:58.600,提供一些便利,00:12:55.560,00:12:58.780,"publish alerts, provide conveniences,"
00:12:58.920,00:13:01.920,然后基本上是你个人的责任,00:12:58.940,00:13:01.220,and then it's all on you.
00:13:02.280,00:13:04.040,你自己采取防范措施,00:13:02.220,00:13:04.260,"It is the responsibility of individuals
to take precautionary measures."
00:13:04.320,00:13:06.000,该去医院就去医院,,,
00:13:06.200,00:13:07.520,医生能不能救活,00:13:04.260,00:13:08.320,"Go to the hospital if you need to, but good luck on the treatment."
00:13:07.520,00:13:07.640,你,,,
00:13:07.640,00:13:08.800,就看你自己的运气,,,
00:13:08.800,00:13:10.920,当然还要看你的财力,00:13:09.320,00:13:10.800,It also depends on how rich you are.
00:13:11.240,00:13:13.080,至于是否会蔓延到全球,00:13:11.045,00:13:13.785,"As for whether H1N1 would spread to
the entire world, it was not their concern."
00:13:13.080,00:13:14.120,那我是不管的,,,
00:13:15.360,00:13:16.880,如果你对美国政府,00:13:15.100,00:13:18.580,"If anyone was unsatisfied with the US government or hospitals,"
00:13:16.920,00:13:18.960,或者美国医院有任何不满,,,
00:13:19.080,00:13:20.240,我是法制社会,,,
00:13:20.240,00:13:21.760,你可以打官司,00:13:19.180,00:13:21.400,they could always sue them.
00:13:21.760,00:13:24.120,当然胜诉的可能性非常之低,00:13:21.620,00:13:26.320,"But the possibility of winning was very low, and they
might have to pay the expensive attorneys themselves."
00:13:24.120,00:13:25.120,昂贵的律师费,,,
00:13:25.120,00:13:26.480,是你要自己支付,,,
00:13:27.920,00:13:29.640,比较中国与美国,,,
00:13:29.680,00:13:32.160,这种应对态度和效果的差别,00:13:27.820,00:13:34.140,"The differences in China and America's disease response
come from the differences in our political systems."
00:13:32.200,00:13:34.720,实际上就是两种政治制度的差别,,,
00:13:35.160,00:13:36.760,美国所谓的民主制度,,,
00:13:36.760,00:13:39.400,说到底是一种程序民主而已,00:13:34.900,00:13:39.000,"America's democratic system is, after all, a procedural democracy."
00:13:39.640,00:13:41.680,只要政府做的不违反程序,00:13:39.700,00:13:43.600,"The job is done as long as the
government does not violate the procedures."
00:13:41.680,00:13:43.480,政府就算完成任务,,,
00:13:43.560,00:13:46.400,大不了下次选举换一个政府,00:13:43.600,00:13:45.980,They can elect a new government
00:13:46.480,00:13:47.600,新政府上来之后,,,
00:13:47.640,00:13:48.560,还是这样做,00:13:46.300,00:13:49.520,and the new government will operate the same way.
00:13:48.600,00:13:49.520,多数人没辙,,,
00:13:49.520,00:13:52.840,整个国家的制度设计就是这样,00:13:50.025,00:13:52.795,This is the design of their institution.
00:13:53.480,00:13:55.080,当然美国有一个本事,00:13:53.245,00:13:56.225,"Of course, America is very good at one thing,"
00:13:55.080,00:13:56.600,就是资本力量控制的,,,
00:13:56.600,00:13:58.000,美国主流媒体,00:13:56.225,00:13:58.420,"that is, using capital to control mainstream media."
00:13:58.200,00:13:59.840,长于设置一体,00:13:58.420,00:14:01.360,They are good at creating topics and shifting focus to
00:13:59.960,00:14:02.040,转移是新大事化,,,
00:14:02.040,00:14:03.000,小小事化,00:14:01.360,00:14:03.600,"""make big problems small, and small problems no problems at all""."
00:14:03.640,00:14:05.600,当然最终受到损害的是普通的,,,
00:14:05.600,00:14:06.320,百姓,00:14:03.600,00:14:07.640,"This is eventually at the expense of
ordinary people instead of the rich."
00:14:06.320,00:14:06.840,富人,,,
00:14:06.840,00:14:08.160,是不大会有危险,,,
00:14:08.960,00:14:10.680,美国有不少网友都认为,00:14:08.765,00:14:11.865,Many American netizens believe that
00:14:10.680,00:14:12.120,这次美国媒体,,,
00:14:12.120,00:14:14.000,大肆炒作中国的疫情,00:14:11.865,00:14:14.945,American media's hype over COVID-19 in China
00:14:14.000,00:14:14.720,很大程度上,,,
00:14:14.720,00:14:16.720,是为了转移美国公众,,,
00:14:16.800,00:14:17.760,对此时此刻,,,
00:14:17.760,00:14:19.200,美国自己国内,00:14:14.945,00:14:22.240,"is largely aiming to divert the attention to the weak
government control of the concurrent flu in America."
00:14:19.200,00:14:19.880,美国政府,,,
00:14:19.880,00:14:22.200,应对流感乏力的一种关注,,,
00:14:23.320,00:14:23.960,坦率的讲,,,
00:14:23.960,00:14:27.080,如果美国不能从自己应对HN一,00:14:22.980,00:14:28.300,"Frankly, if the US cannot learn from its
failed response to the H1N1 outbreak,"
00:14:27.080,00:14:28.560,失败中汲取教训,,,
00:14:28.600,00:14:30.320,真不知道美国遇到一场,,,
00:14:30.320,00:14:30.920,致死率,,,
00:14:30.920,00:14:32.560,更高的传染疾病,00:14:28.860,00:14:35.400,"we cannot imagine what would happen if a more deadly
disease or natural disaster happened in America."
00:14:32.600,00:14:34.240,或者更大的自然灾害,,,
00:14:34.240,00:14:36.320,将以怎样的结局收场,,,
00:14:37.640,00:14:39.120,那么中国的政治制度,00:14:37.420,00:14:40.420,China's political system is oriented in substantive democracy.

00:16:11.200,00:16:12.480,对世界负责,,,
00:16:12.480,00:16:16.120,所以才有世卫组织总干事的感叹,00:16:13.000,00:16:18.440,"The WHO Director General was impressed that

00:16:27.680,00:16:29.480,也为世界防御事业,,,
00:16:29.480,00:16:30.920,设立了新标杆,00:16:28.100,00:16:31.200,and also sets a new benchmark for global epidemic prevention.
00:16:31.800,00:16:33.000,在这个意义上,,,
00:16:33.200,00:16:34.800,中国抗议模式,,,
00:16:34.960,00:16:37.200,就是构建人类命运共同体的,00:16:31.860,00:16:37.880," In this sense, China's anti-epidemic model is a practice
of “building a community of shared future for humanity”."
00:16:37.200,00:16:38.120,实际行动,,,
00:16:38.520,00:16:41.400,这和这种美国忧心,00:16:38.700,00:16:41.220,"This is distinctly different from the US mindsets of “America First”,"
00:16:41.520,00:16:42.840,极端自私,,,
00:16:43.120,00:16:44.360,以邻为壑,00:16:41.800,00:16:46.700,"radical individualism, ""dumping problems

00:16:44.720,00:16:46.920,我赢你输的模式截然不同,,,
00:16:47.440,00:16:48.640,从短期来看,,,
00:16:48.640,00:16:49.680,中国模式意味着,,,
00:16:49.720,00:16:50.880,中国一国,00:16:47.680,00:16:53.140,"In the short term, the Chinese model means that China
alone will bear more responsibilities and costs."
00:16:51.240,00:16:53.720,承担更多的责任和代价,,,
00:16:54.080,00:16:56.200,但中国人相信天下文学,00:16:54.120,00:16:56.560,"However, the Chinese people believe
""All beneath Heaven belongs to the public"" [Confucius]"
00:16:56.400,00:16:57.720,相信得道多助,,,
00:16:57.720,00:16:58.640,失道寡助,00:16:56.560,00:16:59.560,"and ""A just cause attracts much support;
an unjust one finds little"" [Mencius]."

00:17:02.960,00:17:04.920,必将赢得更多的朋友,00:16:59.560,00:17:06.580," China is advancing an anti-pandemic model for the world,
and will win more friends and broader common interests."
00:17:05.080,00:17:07.320,与更广泛的共同利益,,,
00:17:07.560,00:17:08.640,就像1997年,,,
00:17:08.640,00:17:10.120,亚洲金融危机爆发后,,,
00:17:10.120,00:17:13.560,许多国家都竞相贬值自己的货币,00:17:07.660,00:17:14.480,"When the Asian financial crisis began in 1997, many countries
were racing to devalue their currencies to shift the crisis."
00:17:13.560,00:17:14.520,转嫁危机,,,
00:17:14.520,00:17:17.560,而中国展示了大国担当,,,
00:17:17.960,00:17:20.080,坚持人民币汇率的稳定,00:17:15.180,00:17:21.980,"China acted as a responsible big country and insisted on
the stability of the RMB exchange rates,"
00:17:20.200,00:17:22.120,最终赢得了更多的朋友,,,
00:17:22.120,00:17:22.480,和,,,
00:17:22.520,00:17:23.040,广泛,,,
00:17:23.080,00:17:23.960,共同利益,00:17:22.080,00:17:24.600," which ultimately won us more friends
and broader common interests."
00:17:24.560,00:17:25.800,俄罗斯政治学者,,,
00:17:25.800,00:17:27.320,马尔科夫是这样说的,,,
00:17:27.320,00:17:29.000,他说从中国的表现,00:17:24.600,00:17:32.520," Russian political scholar [Sergey Alexandrovich] Markov
said that China’s performance proves itself a great country."
00:17:29.040,00:17:30.120,你可以看出,,,
00:17:30.320,00:17:32.560,这是一个真正伟大的国家,,,
00:17:32.800,00:17:34.800,她独自承受了打击,00:17:32.660,00:17:36.300,"""It took the blow alone and protected the world."""
00:17:34.960,00:17:36.400,保护了全人类,,,
00:17:36.680,00:17:39.360,中国证明了自己有资格成为超级,00:17:36.800,00:17:39.720,"China demonstrated that it is qualified to be a superpower,"
00:17:39.360,00:17:40.120,大国,,,
00:17:40.320,00:17:42.880,并将以此身份走出疫情,,,
00:17:42.920,00:17:45.680,从而大幅度提升自己的软实力,00:17:40.660,00:17:46.020,"and with this superpower we will step out of the
epidemic and significantly grow in soft power."

00:18:03.360,00:18:04.480,感到一份,,,
00:18:04.880,00:18:06.800,他说请大家不要忘记,00:18:05.080,00:18:06.820,He wrote [quoted from the original article]

00:18:24.840,00:18:26.560,注意致命的传染病,,,
00:18:27.000,00:18:27.720,随后,,,
00:18:27.880,00:18:28.960,1983年,,,

identified and isolated the virus,"
00:18:30.280,00:18:31.920,第一次在世界上,,,
00:18:31.920,00:18:33.920,分离了艾滋病病毒,,,
00:18:34.240,00:18:36.200,但当时美国的里根政府,,,
00:18:36.200,00:18:37.720,对此毫不在乎,,,
00:18:38.160,00:18:40.160,公开称这种传染病,00:18:34.360,00:18:42.380,"but the Reagan administration dismissed a journalist’s
question and openly called it the “gay plague”."
00:18:40.280,00:18:42.600,叫同性恋瘟疫,,,
00:18:43.080,00:18:45.560,此时美国已经有800多人死于,00:18:43.280,00:18:46.100,"By then, 800 people had died."
00:18:45.560,00:18:46.480,艾滋病,,,
00:18:46.800,00:18:47.600,里根总统,,,
00:18:47.600,00:18:47.960,一直到,,,
00:18:47.960,00:18:50.600,1985年的9月17号,,,
00:18:50.920,00:18:52.720,当时艾滋病已经在美国,00:18:47.020,00:18:57.580,"Not until September 17 1985, after 12,000 American
deaths, did President Reagan use the word “AIDS”."

00:18:55.520,00:18:58.040,才第1次使用了艾滋病这个词,,,
00:18:58.520,00:19:00.680,所以马可怕这个文章的作者说,,,
00:19:00.680,00:19:02.600,你能想象中国领导人,,,
00:19:02.840,00:19:04.960,在新冠肺炎爆发四年后,00:18:58.640,00:19:07.780,"China’s president Xi Jinping did not wait more than
four years to say the word “coronavirus”."
00:19:05.000,00:19:07.880,才开始使用冠状病毒这个词吗,,,
00:19:08.400,00:19:09.680,中国领导人不到一个月,,,
00:19:09.680,00:19:10.840,就使用这个词,00:19:08.480,00:19:11.440,Far less than four weeks in fact. [quote ends]
00:19:11.680,00:19:12.360,他感叹,,,
00:19:12.360,00:19:13.360,如果美国政府,,,
00:19:13.360,00:19:14.440,能够从一开始,00:19:11.660,00:19:16.460,"He laments that if the US government
had not overlooked AIDS,"
00:19:14.440,00:19:16.560,就注重艾滋病的防控,,,
00:19:16.680,00:19:18.560,人类所蒙受的灾难,,,
00:19:18.560,00:19:20.320,就会大大减轻,00:19:16.940,00:19:20.400,it would have greatly reduced the disaster on humanity.
00:19:20.800,00:19:21.640,众所周知,,,
00:19:21.640,00:19:23.080,截至2018年,,,
00:19:23.080,00:19:27.160,全世界累计有7490多万人,00:19:20.860,00:19:28.400,"As we know, as of 2018, more than 74.9 million people
worldwide were infected with HIV,"
00:19:27.240,00:19:28.800,感染了艾滋病毒,,,
00:19:28.960,00:19:31.600,其中3200万人死亡,,,
00:19:31.640,00:19:34.160,他们已经永远离开了这个世界,00:19:29.140,00:19:34.200,of which 32 million people have left the world forever.
00:19:35.240,00:19:37.560,这里我跟大家分享一段回忆,00:19:35.300,00:19:37.540,Here is a memory I'd like to share with you

00:19:39.760,00:19:42.160,中国领导人邓小平会见,00:19:37.540,00:19:44.740,"On April 15, 1987, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping met with former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere who was visiting China."
00:19:42.160,00:19:43.080,来访华的,,,
00:19:43.080,00:19:45.200,坦桑尼亚前总统尼雷尔,,,
00:19:45.560,00:19:46.720,我担任翻译,,,
00:19:47.080,00:19:49.040,那么话题转到了艾滋病,00:19:45.700,00:19:49.140,I worked as their interpreter and translated their discussion on AIDS.
00:19:49.200,00:19:51.320,邓小平当时非常肯定的说,,,
00:19:51.480,00:19:52.400,艾滋病,00:19:49.140,00:19:55.460,"Deng Xiaoping said with certainty, ""The US has the most
AIDS cases, and drug injection is a major reason.”"
00:19:52.600,00:19:55.600,美国最多吸毒是一个主要原因,,,
00:19:56.480,00:19:57.120,他接着说,,,
00:19:57.320,00:19:58.800,我们现在在尝试,,,
00:19:58.800,00:20:01.640,用中草药来治疗艾滋病,00:19:56.480,00:20:01.380,"He then said,"" We are now trying to use
Chinese herbal medicine to treat AIDS."""
00:20:02.200,00:20:03.560,听了这番话,,,
00:20:03.560,00:20:04.360,尼雷尔说,,,
00:20:04.360,00:20:06.240,对我们坦桑尼亚来讲,00:20:02.260,00:20:10.220,"Nyerere said that, “For Tanzania, the biggest disease
is not AIDS, but malaria.”"
00:20:06.360,00:20:07.840,现在最大的疾病,,,
00:20:08.600,00:20:09.480,而不是艾滋病,,,
00:20:09.480,00:20:10.400,而是疟疾,,,
00:20:11.360,00:20:12.280,尼丽尔的判断,,,
00:20:12.320,00:20:14.000,当时也许是对,00:20:11.400,00:20:14.220,"At that time, Nyerere's judgment might be correct,"
00:20:14.280,00:20:16.320,但是后来发展的情况看,,,
00:20:16.320,00:20:17.800,他对艾滋病的非处的,00:20:14.220,00:20:19.480,"but with hindsight, he underestimated the
possibility of an AIDS pandemic in Africa."
00:20:17.800,00:20:20.040,泛滥的可能性低估了,,,
00:20:20.240,00:20:21.920,我上世纪九十年代,,,
00:20:21.920,00:20:23.720,曾访问过博茨瓦纳,00:20:20.420,00:20:26.580,"In the 1990s, in African countries including Botswana,
South Africa, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Swaziland,"
00:20:23.720,00:20:25.040,南非,,,
00:20:25.040,00:20:25.920,坦桑尼亚,,,
00:20:25.920,00:20:26.800,莫桑比克,,,
00:20:26.800,00:20:28.960,斯维斯兰等非洲国家,,,
00:20:29.200,00:20:30.720,艾滋病当时已经成为,00:20:26.980,00:20:31.960,AIDS became the number one local killer.
00:20:30.720,00:20:32.160,当地的头号杀手,,,
00:20:32.160,00:20:32.800,一些国家,,,
00:20:32.840,00:20:34.520,1/3的成年人,00:20:32.280,00:20:36.660,One third of adults in some countries were HIV-positive.
00:20:34.560,00:20:36.680,是艾滋病毒感染者,,,
00:20:37.040,00:20:39.240,在斯威士兰棺材生产,,,
00:20:39.240,00:20:40.400,一度成为整个国家,00:20:37.140,00:20:41.480,"In Swaziland, the coffin industry was
once the fastest growing industry."
00:20:40.400,00:20:42.080,增长最快的产业,,,
00:20:42.480,00:20:45.800,那天邓小平还和尼利亚总统,00:20:42.560,00:20:47.160,"That day, Deng Xiaoping and President Nyerere also
discussed China-Africa cooperation"
00:20:45.800,00:20:47.400,探讨了中非合作,,,
00:20:47.400,00:20:48.520,用中西结合,,,
00:20:48.520,00:20:50.240,来治疗疟疾和艾滋病,00:20:47.160,00:20:50.600,"on treating malaria and AIDS with
integrated Chinese and Western medicine."
00:20:50.880,00:20:52.120,邓小平对他说,,,
00:20:52.120,00:20:53.680,中国土地革命的时候,00:20:50.900,00:20:53.840,"Deng Xiaoping told him that during the Chinese Agrarian Revolution,"
00:20:53.720,00:20:56.520,我们打仗缺医少药治病,00:20:53.840,00:20:58.500,"we fought without medicine and doctors, and many
were treated by Chinese herbal medicine."
00:20:56.520,00:20:58.280,很多都是靠中草药,,,
00:20:59.280,00:21:00.720,我回忆这段往事,00:20:59.300,00:21:01.700,We can learn two things from this story.
00:21:00.720,00:21:02.120,想说明2.,,,
00:21:02.120,00:21:04.520,1是中国从最高领导人,00:21:02.120,00:21:06.100,"First, from China’s paramount leader to the general public,"
00:21:04.520,00:21:05.480,到普通民众,,,
00:21:05.480,00:21:08.360,都认为传染疾病是人类公敌,00:21:06.680,00:21:09.160,"everyone agrees that infectious diseases
are the common enemy of humanity,"
00:21:08.560,00:21:08.760,的,,,
00:21:09.160,00:21:10.760,各国都要精诚合作,00:21:09.160,00:21:12.040,and all countries must respond together with sincerity.
00:21:10.760,00:21:12.080,共同应对,,,
00:21:12.320,00:21:14.960,人历史上经历过天花,,,
00:21:14.960,00:21:16.120,鼠疫,00:21:12.400,00:21:18.980,"The human history through smallpox, plague, leprosy,
malaria and many other epidemics"
00:21:16.160,00:21:19.600,麻风疟疾等很多瘟疫,,,
00:21:19.720,00:21:22.880,没有任何国家可以独善其身,00:21:19.220,00:21:22.880,"shows us that no country can come out of them unscathed,"
00:21:23.080,00:21:24.600,构建人类命运共同体,,,
00:21:24.600,00:21:26.240,是人类社会的唯一政党,00:21:23.060,00:21:26.580,and the only right path for humanity is a community of shared futured.
00:21:27.160,00:21:29.680,二是面对各种肆虐的病毒,00:21:27.200,00:21:29.540,"Second, in the face of evolving viruses,"
00:21:29.680,00:21:31.560,我们要探索中医药治疗,,,
00:21:31.560,00:21:33.040,中西医结合治疗,00:21:29.780,00:21:33.600,"we must explore the integration of traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine."
00:21:33.600,00:21:34.000,中医,,,
00:21:34.040,00:21:35.760,西医各有所长,00:21:33.600,00:21:37.200,"TCM and western medicine both have their own
strengths and can complement each other."
00:21:35.760,00:21:37.160,可以优势互补,,,
00:21:37.440,00:21:38.800,这次抗议过程中,,,
00:21:38.800,00:21:41.040,中医药发挥了很好的疗效,00:21:37.380,00:21:42.020,"The fight against coronavirus has
witnessed encouraging effects of TCM."
00:21:41.040,00:21:42.320,十分令人鼓舞,,,
00:21:42.560,00:21:43.840,像我们整个社会,,,
00:21:43.840,00:21:44.920,都更加重视,00:21:42.720,00:21:45.340,I hope that our society will value TCM more
00:21:44.920,00:21:45.680,中医,,,
00:21:45.680,00:21:47.600,更加重视中西医结合,00:21:45.760,00:21:49.000,"and attach more importance to the
integration of Chinese and Western medicine."
00:21:47.600,00:21:48.320,这条路,,,
00:21:48.320,00:21:49.160,一定走得通,,,
00:21:49.360,00:21:51.000,而且应该是中华文明,,,
00:21:51.000,00:21:53.200,对人类文明的宝贵贡献,00:21:49.440,00:21:53.420,"It will work, and it should be a valuable contribution
of the Chinese civilization to humanity."
00:21:53.640,00:21:54.240,好,,,
00:21:54.280,00:21:55.720,各种迹象都表明,00:21:53.960,00:21:56.960,"We’ve been seeing signs that indicate the dark clouds
of the epidemic will soon pass,"
00:21:55.720,00:21:57.760,疫情的乌云即将过去,,,
00:21:57.760,00:21:59.640,曙光就在前面,00:21:57.080,00:21:59.220,and the light of the dawn is breaking.
00:21:59.680,00:22:01.840,忽雨过后是灿烂的彩虹,00:21:59.520,00:22:01.860,We will see the shine of the rainbow after the storm.
00:22:01.840,00:22:03.120,让我们共同进入,,,
00:22:03.120,00:22:05.400,即将到来的美好的明天,00:22:02.060,00:22:06.100,Let us be patient as we wait for tomorrow. Thank you.
00:22:05.480,00:22:07.040,谢谢大家,00:22:06.420,00:22:08.440,"Translators: Twitter/FB/IG @BrigadeMagpie
微信公众号/微博: 鹊桥小队翻译组"
00:22:08.160,00:22:09.960,刚才张老师在演讲当中,,,
00:22:09.960,00:22:10.880,也特别提到,,,
00:22:10.880,00:22:12.200,你看国际社会对中国,00:22:08.540,00:22:13.740,"Professor Zhang mentioned international comments on
China's response to the coronaviru"
00:22:12.200,00:22:14.280,这次抗击疫情的评价,,,
00:22:14.280,00:22:17.080,也说到中国是独自承担起了,,,
00:22:17.120,00:22:18.680,肺炎疫情的压力,00:22:14.600,00:22:21.580,"and the pressure on China to prevent the spread
of the disease to the rest of the world."
00:22:19.040,00:22:22.080,不要让压力蔓延到其他的地方,,,
00:22:22.080,00:22:23.720,确实我们受到的压力很大,00:22:22.100,00:22:25.240,"We are under a lot of pressure and many
have been working under this pressure."
00:22:23.760,00:22:25.040,很多人在付出,,,
00:22:25.080,00:22:25.920,所以今天我们在,,,
00:22:25.960,00:22:26.680,讨论这个话题,,,
00:22:26.720,00:22:29.760,之前我也想要连线前方的一位,00:22:25.240,00:22:31.040,"Before we open up the Q&A session, I will
connect with an engineer on the front line."
00:22:29.760,00:22:30.680,工作人员,,,
00:22:30.680,00:22:34.040,她从事的是ct设备安装的,00:22:31.520,00:22:35.580,"His name is Wang Hongbin, and he is
installing CT equipment in Wuhan City."
00:22:34.040,00:22:34.680,工程师,,,
00:22:34.680,00:22:35.800,他叫王宏斌,,,
00:22:35.840,00:22:36.080,你好,,,
00:22:36.120,00:22:36.920,王宏斌,00:22:35.840,00:22:37.740,"- Hello, Hongbin.
- Hello."
00:22:37.360,00:22:37.840,你好,,,
00:22:37.880,00:22:38.120,你好,,,
00:22:38.120,00:22:38.880,王宏斌辛苦了,,,
00:22:38.880,00:22:40.680,你现在是在武汉的哪里,00:22:38.040,00:22:40.860,"Hello, Hongbin, thanks for joining us.
Where are you in Wuhan now?"
00:22:41.160,00:22:44.520,在武汉光谷方舱医院,00:22:41.300,00:22:44.200,I'm at the Optics Valley “Cabin Hospital”.
00:22:44.560,00:22:44.680,好,,,
00:22:44.720,00:22:45.960,你是在为光谷方舱,,,
00:22:45.960,00:22:47.840,搭建CT设备吗,00:22:44.520,00:22:47.600,Are you installing CT equipment for the cabin hospital?
00:22:48.000,00:22:48.360,对,,,
00:22:48.400,00:22:50.560,我们在这边正在调试,00:22:48.200,00:22:50.440,"Yes, we are testing the devices."
00:22:50.880,00:22:51.840,您能告诉我们,,,
00:22:51.840,00:22:54.000,您从一开始接到通知,00:22:50.900,00:22:56.620,"Can you tell us about the process from being informed
to starting work on the front line?"
00:22:54.000,00:22:55.320,到赴一线工作,,,
00:22:55.320,00:22:56.800,这是一个怎样的过程吗,,,
00:22:57.120,00:22:59.520,当时就说武汉前线这边,,,
00:23:00.520,00:23:03.240,工程师人员比较吃紧,00:22:57.220,00:23:04.300,"Not many engineers were available and
Wuhan needed a lot of support."
00:23:03.240,00:23:04.520,需要大家来支援,,,
00:23:04.560,00:23:06.600,然后当时我想的是,,,
00:23:06.600,00:23:09.200,首先我作为一个共产党员,00:23:04.540,00:23:10.000,"So I thought, as a member of the
Communist Party, I must sign up."
00:23:09.200,00:23:10.320,我肯定要第1个报名,,,
00:23:10.480,00:23:13.000,然后我就买了正月初三的机票,,,
00:23:13.000,00:23:15.040,从新疆出发,00:23:10.000,00:23:16.360,"I booked the flight for Jan 27 [the third day of the
Chinese New Year holiday] from Xinjiang to Shanghai."
00:23:15.040,00:23:16.760,然后到了上海,,,
00:23:16.800,00:23:18.720,然后因为当时武汉所有的公共,,,
00:23:18.720,00:23:19.040,交通,,,
00:23:19.080,00:23:19.960,都已经停了,00:23:17.040,00:23:21.400,"As all public travel to Wuhan were
suspended including rail and flights,"
00:23:20.280,00:23:20.760,高铁,,,
00:23:20.840,00:23:21.760,飞机什么,,,
00:23:22.200,00:23:23.400,都没有办法了,,,
00:23:23.400,00:23:26.360,然后我们最后是公司派的车,,,
00:23:26.360,00:23:29.960,然后安排我们6个人用车,00:23:21.980,00:23:32.960,our company hired a minibus to drive the 6 of us to Wuhan.
00:23:30.000,00:23:31.400,然后把我们拉到武汉了,,,
00:23:31.400,00:23:33.600,当时从出发,,,
00:23:33.640,00:23:37.080,到武汉花了将近30个小时,00:23:34.020,00:23:37.880,The ride was about 30 hours.
00:23:37.480,00:23:38.360,您的这样一个经历,,,
00:23:38.360,00:23:39.200,恐怕也是很多,,,
00:23:39.200,00:23:41.280,一线工作人员的一个缩影,00:23:38.040,00:23:41.280,Your experience is probably the epitome of many front-line workers.
00:23:41.640,00:23:43.520,我知道您从到达武汉,,,
00:23:43.560,00:23:45.160,一直到我们录制节目的,00:23:41.600,00:23:47.820,"I understand that you have been working in Wuhan
for more than 20 days since you arrived."
00:23:45.160,00:23:45.840,今天,,,
00:23:45.880,00:23:48.120,已经在武汉工作了20多天了,,,
00:23:48.120,00:23:49.120,在这20多天里面,,,
00:23:49.120,00:23:50.360,可能安装了很多设备,00:23:48.200,00:23:50.540,You probably have already installed many devices.
00:23:50.400,00:23:51.880,这一次的安装设备,,,
00:23:51.880,00:23:53.040,跟你以往的经验,00:23:50.740,00:23:55.120,But I'd like to ask how the experience is different and what are the challenges.
00:23:53.080,00:23:54.000,他有什么不一样,,,
00:23:54.000,00:23:55.040,困难在哪,,,
00:23:55.760,00:23:56.560,是这样的,,,
00:23:56.600,00:23:58.680,一般我们安装设备,,,
00:23:58.680,00:23:59.640,可能都是,00:23:55.980,00:24:02.920,"Generally speaking, buildings have been completely constructed"
00:24:00.800,00:24:02.440,机房都已经建好了,,,
00:24:02.440,00:24:03.760,然后包括场地,,,
00:24:03.800,00:24:05.680,基本上都装到空调,,,
00:24:05.680,00:24:06.760,什么都已经装好了,,,
00:24:06.800,00:24:09.320,就满足我们装机条件之后,00:24:03.220,00:24:10.680,"with AC and other systems in place
before we install medical devices."
00:24:09.360,00:24:10.880,我们才去再做安装,,,
00:24:10.920,00:24:14.240,但这次就是任务非常紧,00:24:11.200,00:24:14.220,But this project has a very tight timeline.
00:24:15.400,00:24:17.560,就拿火辰山来说,,,
00:24:17.760,00:24:19.600,整个医院的建设进度,00:24:14.700,00:24:21.940," At Huoshenshan Hospital for example, the construction
of the entire hospital was about ten days,"
00:24:19.600,00:24:22.320,也就是大概10天左右,,,
00:24:22.360,00:24:24.160,然后留给我们设备,,,
00:24:24.160,00:24:25.240,能进场的时间,00:24:22.480,00:24:26.120,and we only had about 48 hours to go in.
00:24:25.240,00:24:27.760,也就48小时左右,,,
00:24:27.760,00:24:30.960,而且有几千人都在现场施工现场,00:24:26.640,00:24:36.520,"There were thousands of construction workers on site,
and it was a very dusty environment."
00:24:30.960,00:24:31.080,的,,,
00:24:32.440,00:24:33.320,包括环境,,,
00:24:34.120,00:24:36.720,粉尘这块是非常大的,,,
00:24:36.720,00:24:38.240,从我工作至今,,,
00:24:38.400,00:24:40.200,应该是第一次,00:24:37.280,00:24:42.320,I had never worked in such an environment before.
00:24:40.600,00:24:42.880,见到这种场景,,,
00:24:42.880,00:24:44.240,机器已经落在那里了,,,
00:24:44.240,00:24:46.560,机房墙墙壁防护,00:24:43.000,00:24:45.720,There was no machine room and no shielding walls.
00:24:46.560,00:24:47.240,什么都没有,,,
00:24:47.240,00:24:51.000,只能现砌墙线装防护,00:24:45.920,00:24:50.800,They built walls and radiation protection as we installed the devices.
00:24:52.240,00:24:54.040,但是是这样的一种困难的环境,00:24:52.280,00:24:55.620,"But everyone was still racing against time
despite the difficult environment."
00:24:54.040,00:24:55.640,你们还是跟时间赛跑,,,
00:24:55.640,00:24:56.280,我们注意到,,,
00:24:56.320,00:24:57.800,王红兵的身着防护服,,,
00:24:57.800,00:24:58.880,因为在一线工作,00:24:55.780,00:25:00.360,"We noticed that Hongbin is wearing protective gear as
they must protect themselves on the front line."
00:24:58.880,00:25:00.440,他们必须要有这样的一个自我的,,,
00:25:00.440,00:25:00.760,保护,,,
00:25:00.800,00:25:02.000,其实穿着防护服,,,
00:25:02.000,00:25:03.600,在来做调试设备,,,
00:25:03.600,00:25:04.120,安装设备,00:25:00.600,00:25:07.660,"But it makes the installation and testing work
very difficult wearing protective clothing."
00:25:04.160,00:25:04.920,这样的一个工作,,,
00:25:04.920,00:25:06.520,是非常不容易的,,,
00:25:06.520,00:25:07.880,也特别辛苦,,,
00:25:08.000,00:25:10.120,我知道您的时间非常宝贵,,,
00:25:10.120,00:25:11.560,因为您还在前线工作,00:25:08.060,00:25:13.480,"I understand your time is very valuable working
on the front line, and I just have one last question."
00:25:11.600,00:25:13.280,但是还想问您最后一个问题,,,
00:25:13.440,00:25:15.200,这一次这样一种特殊的经历,,,
00:25:15.200,00:25:18.000,我不知道现在您的感受是什么,00:25:13.520,00:25:17.500, How do you feel about this special task?
00:25:18.200,00:25:20.840,刚开始的到武汉的时候,,,
00:25:20.880,00:25:22.760,确实心里面没有底,00:25:18.480,00:25:24.580,"I was very nervous and unsure when I first arrived in Wuhan,"
00:25:22.760,00:25:24.960,就是非常慌张,,,
00:25:25.080,00:25:28.160,然后慢慢的被一种感动,00:25:25.080,00:25:29.480,but I feel touched by the city as I work here.
00:25:28.360,00:25:31.080,确实是因为有一次,,,
00:25:31.120,00:25:33.000,我在武汉某一个方舱,00:25:30.040,00:25:35.180,"When we were working at a cabin hospital,"
00:25:33.200,00:25:34.720,我们在装设备的时候,,,
00:25:34.720,00:25:37.240,然后方舱离病人,,,
00:25:37.800,00:25:39.600,他们去洗漱的通道,00:25:35.940,00:25:42.680,"we were less than 3 meters away from the aisle
where the patients went to bathrooms."
00:25:39.600,00:25:40.600,是非常近的,,,
00:25:40.600,00:25:43.080,只有两三米不到三米距离,,,
00:25:43.360,00:25:45.920,有一天我们在外面施工的时候,,,
00:25:45.960,00:25:48.120,然后有一个清官患者,00:25:43.460,00:25:51.840,"One night when we were working outside, a patient
walked by and asked us how the installation was going."
00:25:48.320,00:25:49.200,从那走过去问,,,
00:25:49.200,00:25:51.320,就问我们这设备装的怎么样,,,
00:25:51.440,00:25:52.440,我们说应该快,,,
00:25:52.440,00:25:52.760,好了,,,
00:25:52.800,00:25:54.480,今天下午就给用了,00:25:52.120,00:25:54.220,"We said it should be done soon and the device
would be available in the afternoon."
00:25:54.480,00:25:56.760,然后他说你们非常辛苦,,,
00:25:56.760,00:25:59.080,然后从昨天晚上,,,
00:25:59.080,00:26:01.040,就开始连夜的在这干到现在,00:25:54.500,00:26:04.280,"He said, “You worked so hard. Working overnight
to make the devices available in less than a day."""
00:26:01.080,00:26:02.040,不到24小时,,,
00:26:02.040,00:26:04.800,就能够把设备调试好,,,
00:26:04.920,00:26:05.800,为你们点赞,,,
00:26:05.840,00:26:06.280,到时说,00:26:04.920,00:26:06.920,"""You guys are great."""
00:26:06.800,00:26:09.960,我当时就心里非常感动,00:26:06.920,00:26:10.840,I was very touched by his words.
00:26:09.960,00:26:12.120,我觉得能够在一线,,,
00:26:12.160,00:26:15.240,然后为这次抗激情,,,
00:26:15.280,00:26:17.160,就是贡献自己的一份力量,00:26:10.840,00:26:19.800, I felt very proud to be able to contribute my effort on the front line.
00:26:18.360,00:26:20.400,我觉得非常自豪,,,
00:26:22.040,00:26:23.480,而且包括,,,
00:26:23.600,00:26:26.120,我像我们来的这些工程师,00:26:20.860,00:26:26.960,"(Thank you ...)
People who work here all have different roles in life."
00:26:26.120,00:26:28.280,其实每个人在生活中,,,
00:26:28.280,00:26:29.440,他可能是个孩子,,,
00:26:29.440,00:26:30.360,也可能,00:26:27.540,00:26:33.020,"We are children, parents, or spouses."
00:26:31.200,00:26:31.920,是个父亲,,,
00:26:32.200,00:26:33.920,也可能是个丈夫,,,
00:26:34.040,00:26:36.400,我在生活中扮演不同的角色,,,
00:26:36.400,00:26:37.960,但是到了我们前线之后,00:26:34.320,00:26:40.240,"But on the front line, we have only one role — the fighters."
00:26:37.960,00:26:39.120,我们只有一个角色,,,
00:26:39.280,00:26:40.360,就是战士,,,
00:26:40.920,00:26:42.120,我们只能往前冲,,,
00:26:42.160,00:26:43.480,不能往后退,00:26:40.940,00:26:43.540,"We can only keep going, there’s no turning back."
00:26:43.520,00:26:45.520,不管什么多多大的困难,00:26:43.540,00:26:47.260,"No matter how difficult it is, we will go forward."
00:26:45.520,00:26:47.600,我们肯定是迎难而上,,,
00:26:49.760,00:26:50.760,谢谢王宏斌,00:26:49.420,00:26:51.120,"Thank you, thank you Hongbin."
00:26:50.760,00:26:52.120,胜利一定会等着,,,
00:26:52.120,00:26:52.960,你们,,,
00:26:52.960,00:26:54.160,也特别像,00:26:51.120,00:26:55.600,"Victory awaits you. I'd like to send my
regards to you and your coworkers."
00:26:54.160,00:26:56.000,你和你的同事们致敬,,,
00:26:56.000,00:26:56.720,你们辛苦了,,,
00:26:56.720,00:26:58.360,在前方保重好自己,00:26:55.880,00:26:59.900,"You’ve all worked hard!  Please take care
of yourselves as you fight until victory."
00:26:58.360,00:27:00.160,继续战斗到胜利那一刻,,,
00:27:00.160,00:27:00.680,谢谢,00:27:00.320,00:27:01.400,Thank you.
00:27:01.720,00:27:02.160,好的,00:27:01.400,00:27:03.040,"Thank you, we will."
00:27:02.720,00:27:03.360,谢谢,,,
00:27:03.760,00:27:05.400,其实在这段连线的时候,,,
00:27:05.400,00:27:08.000,我非常感动,00:27:03.720,00:27:07.760,I was very touched during the call.
00:27:10.200,00:27:12.080,他是很多在前线工作,00:27:10.400,00:27:13.540,He is the epitome of the many frontline workers.
00:27:12.120,00:27:13.160,的人员的缩影,,,
00:27:13.760,00:27:15.160,我们知道有无数的,,,
00:27:15.200,00:27:16.120,护人员,,,
00:27:16.480,00:27:18.160,民警我刚说的,00:27:13.540,00:27:19.200,"The numerous medical workers, police, and community personnel."
00:27:18.160,00:27:19.240,各种各样的社区人员,,,
00:27:19.240,00:27:21.120,可能我们看的见他们的身影,,,
00:27:21.120,00:27:22.800,但是还有很多看不见的,00:27:19.200,00:27:23.520,"We may have been seeing them around,
and there are also many invisible workers"
00:27:22.800,00:27:24.200,保障力量也在工作,,,
00:27:24.200,00:27:26.240,就像王宏彬和他的伙伴们,00:27:23.520,00:27:27.440,just like Wang Hongbin and his colleagues.
00:27:26.520,00:27:27.600,其中的一员,,,
00:27:27.600,00:27:30.560,全部都是不计生死,,,
00:27:30.560,00:27:31.880,不计名利,00:27:27.940,00:27:34.240,"They charged to the front in disregard of “life and death”,
“fame and fortune”, and “gain and loss”."
00:27:31.880,00:27:34.320,不计得失去到前方,,,
00:27:34.360,00:27:35.440,所以我们刚刚说,,,
00:27:35.440,00:27:36.240,我们的疫情,,,
00:27:36.240,00:27:37.840,能够在这样的一段时间里面,00:27:34.680,00:27:40.920,"They push the situation to change for the better,
and their work brings us the light of hope."
00:27:37.840,00:27:39.000,有一个向好的变化,,,
00:27:39.040,00:27:40.360,让大家看到一些希望,,,
00:27:40.400,00:27:41.360,看到光明,,,
00:27:41.400,00:27:43.080,这是非常来之不易的,,,
00:27:43.120,00:27:45.040,就是因为他们在奋斗,00:27:41.440,00:27:44.760,We must never take their work for granted.
00:27:45.040,00:27:47.000,所以平时节目里面,00:27:45.320,00:27:48.040,"In previous episodes, Professor Zhang, you have often said"
00:27:47.040,00:27:48.280,张教授一直说,,,
00:27:48.320,00:27:50.360,中国人是有家国情怀的,00:27:48.040,00:27:50.820,"the Chinese people have a sense of
“identity between nation and family”."
00:27:50.680,00:27:53.440,您在这样的一些讲述里面,,,
00:27:53.440,00:27:54.680,我也很想听听您,00:27:50.960,00:27:56.400,How do you feel after the call?
00:27:55.520,00:27:56.640,感受是怎样,,,
00:27:56.680,00:27:58.320,是我刚才听了,00:27:56.940,00:27:59.140,I’m very touched as well.
00:27:58.320,00:27:59.840,我也是蛮感动的,,,
00:27:59.840,00:28:02.040,因为这一段时间,,,
00:28:02.120,00:28:04.920,实际上有无数的逆行者,00:27:59.140,00:28:06.880,"There were innumerable people who traveled in the reverse
direction towards the center of the national emergency."
00:28:04.920,00:28:07.400,一批又一批的一户人员,,,
00:28:07.400,00:28:08.760,解放军战士,,,
00:28:09.520,00:28:10.680,工程师,,,
00:28:11.040,00:28:13.360,志愿者奔赴武汉,00:28:07.360,00:28:17.040,"Medical workers, PLA soldiers, engineers,
and volunteers rushed to Hubei one batch after another."
00:28:13.360,00:28:14.480,奔赴湖北,,,
00:28:14.480,00:28:17.040,就是国家有难共赴国难,,,
00:28:17.040,00:28:19.800,你比方说海外华人也是一下子,,,
00:28:20.280,00:28:21.480,我24号,00:28:17.220,00:28:24.140,"I was in Davos, Switzerland on January 24th and 25th."
00:28:21.480,00:28:22.160,25号人,,,
00:28:22.200,00:28:24.520,还在瑞士开了达沃斯会议,,,
00:28:25.000,00:28:26.440,口罩卖完了,,,
00:28:26.440,00:28:27.960,都是往国内运,00:28:25.180,00:28:28.320,Local Chinese expats have bought all the masks to send back home.
00:28:28.720,00:28:30.640,这华人的情家国情怀,00:28:28.480,00:28:30.840,Chinese expats have a sense of “identity between nation and family”.
00:28:31.840,00:28:33.440,我上次看报道,,,
00:28:33.440,00:28:36.560,就采访我们90后的故事,00:28:31.080,00:28:38.580," I watched an interview of a post-90s nurse.
She spoke very touchingly."
00:28:36.640,00:28:38.120,护士讲的很感人,,,
00:28:38.120,00:28:40.840,他说我是90后,,,
00:28:41.080,00:28:42.760,03年非典的时候,,,
00:28:42.760,00:28:44.280,你们保护了我们,00:28:39.200,00:28:46.520,"She said, “You protected us post-90s during SARS in
2003. Now it is time for us to take the responsibility.”"
00:28:44.280,00:28:46.960,现在是我们要承担起责任了,,,
00:28:47.000,00:28:47.880,很感人的,,,
00:28:47.920,00:28:49.800,这是一种家国情怀,00:28:47.040,00:28:50.260,This is their sense of “identity between nation and family”.
00:28:50.600,00:28:53.000,实际上包括我们看到,,,
00:28:53.880,00:28:56.440,一线医务人员的付出,00:28:50.260,00:28:58.620,"We have witnessed the hard work of our front-line
medical workers, which is very rare around the world."
00:28:56.480,00:28:58.040,是非常少有的,,,
00:28:58.040,00:28:59.640,就其他国家,,,
00:28:59.640,00:29:02.640,这种在他们的体制下,,,
00:29:02.640,00:29:04.520,实际上是很难支撑,00:28:58.640,00:29:08.400," It is very difficult for other countries to support
such a campaign under their systems."
00:29:04.520,00:29:06.200,这样一个巨大的,,,
00:29:07.200,00:29:08.800,我们或者说是战役,,,
00:29:08.920,00:29:10.360,我觉得这个是由,,,
00:29:10.360,00:29:12.680,我们中华民族文明的精髓的,00:29:09.340,00:29:13.600," In my opinion, this is in the essence of the Chinese civilization,"
00:29:13.880,00:29:17.880,所以千万人就是吾往矣,00:29:13.840,00:29:19.260,"""I will go despite the opposition of thousands.” [Mencius]"
00:29:17.920,00:29:18.280,对,,,
00:29:18.280,00:29:20.840,是这样一个精髓在里面,,,
00:29:20.960,00:29:21.760,您刚也说,,,
00:29:21.760,00:29:22.560,可能其他国家,,,
00:29:22.560,00:29:23.240,它的制度,,,
00:29:23.280,00:29:24.920,不会支撑这样的一种,00:29:21.220,00:29:27.620,"You said  it might be difficult for other countries
to support a war-like movement against the disease."
00:29:24.920,00:29:26.360,对抗疫情的方式,,,
00:29:26.400,00:29:27.760,您能再说的具体一点,,,
00:29:28.440,00:29:29.400,我举个例子,,,
00:29:29.400,00:29:30.080,就是刚才,00:29:28.380,00:29:30.660,Can you elaborate on that?
00:29:31.040,00:29:32.720,张维为教授提到的,,,
00:29:32.720,00:29:37.640,美国2009年甲流这样一个,00:29:31.340,00:29:36.700,"For example, Professor Zhang talked about
H1N1 in the United States in 2009."
00:29:37.640,00:29:39.160,事件初期,,,
00:29:39.160,00:29:40.080,它因为科技比,00:29:37.380,00:29:42.040,"They had advanced technology to take response in the early stages,"
00:29:40.640,00:29:41.840,他反应是很快的,,,
00:29:42.400,00:29:43.480,疫苗也开发得,00:29:42.040,00:29:44.420,and vaccine was developed relatively quickly.
00:29:43.520,00:29:43.920,一要,,,
00:29:44.520,00:29:46.320,但是整个制度,,,
00:29:46.440,00:29:47.520,很难做到,00:29:44.480,00:29:49.500,But it was difficult to achieve effective isolation in the [social] system.
00:29:47.520,00:29:49.400,有效地进行隔离,,,
00:29:49.440,00:29:52.120,它只是建议和指导,00:29:49.820,00:29:52.020,They only provided advice and guidance.
00:29:52.360,00:29:53.760,具体你怎么做,,,
00:29:54.120,00:29:55.600,它实际上很难控制,,,
00:29:55.720,00:29:59.720,这个就导致了甲流全球的蔓延,00:29:52.020,00:29:59.540,"There was no control over how people enforced them,
which lead to the global spread of H1N1."
00:30:00.000,00:30:02.480,那么它的各个地方政府,00:30:00.100,00:30:04.200,So what were the specific measures taken by local governments?
00:30:02.480,00:30:04.200,它具体的做法又是怎么样的,,,
00:30:04.360,00:30:05.360,他有没有做到,,,
00:30:05.360,00:30:06.800,比如说我要控制这个疫情,,,
00:30:06.800,00:30:08.520,我要用全社会的力量调动,00:30:04.600,00:30:11.360,"Did they mobilize the entire society to
prevent its spread to other places."
00:30:08.520,00:30:09.960,不让蔓延开来,,,
00:30:09.960,00:30:10.960,去影响别的,,,
00:30:11.000,00:30:11.440,方,,,
00:30:11.880,00:30:12.800,他就是这样的,,,
00:30:13.600,00:30:14.760,2010年1月,,,
00:30:14.960,00:30:16.880,纽约时报它有一个评论,00:30:12.100,00:30:20.560,"In January 2010, the New York Times commented
“America’s reaction was apt and lucky”."
00:30:16.880,00:30:19.280,他说美国的做法叫,,,
00:30:19.320,00:30:20.720,谨慎而幸运,,,
00:30:20.760,00:30:23.360,那么为什么纽约时报说幸运,00:30:21.140,00:30:23.140," Why ""lucky”?"
00:30:23.840,00:30:24.040,因为,,,
00:30:24.360,00:30:25.160,甲流病毒,,,
00:30:25.240,00:30:26.600,它的死亡率,00:30:23.800,00:30:29.260,"Because the death rate was at 0.02%,
killing a small number of people."
00:30:26.640,00:30:28.280,只有0.03%,,,
00:30:28.280,00:30:29.560,实际上是比较少的,,,
00:30:29.600,00:30:30.600,美国本土,,,
00:30:30.720,00:30:33.840,因为相当于它的医疗的系统,00:30:29.660,00:30:35.780,"Because the United States had strong medical and research systems,"
00:30:33.840,00:30:34.800,还是比较强大的,,,
00:30:34.800,00:30:36.600,它科研力量也比较强大,,,
00:30:36.600,00:30:38.480,就他6000万人感染,,,
00:30:38.920,00:30:41.080,它死亡率相对比较低,00:30:36.680,00:30:42.180,"they were able to keep the death rate low
for the 60 million infected Americans."
00:30:41.080,00:30:42.640,它能救活更多的人,,,
00:30:43.080,00:30:45.000,但是蔓延到其他地方,,,
00:30:45.320,00:30:47.280,实际上它没有强制性的,00:30:43.180,00:30:47.780,"However, there were no compulsory measures
to prevent the spread of the disease."
00:30:47.320,00:30:48.280,这样一个措施,,,
00:30:48.320,00:30:51.600,连旅行的也只是建议,00:30:48.520,00:30:52.200,There were only travel warnings.
00:30:51.640,00:30:53.000,你不要去旅行,,,
00:30:53.320,00:30:56.600,相当于你如果是像现在武汉这种,,,
00:30:56.600,00:30:56.920,情况,,,
00:30:57.080,00:30:58.280,如果你病原体,00:30:53.220,00:31:03.400,"If we did this in Wuhan, no control over the virus carriers,
they would spread it to a larger population."
00:30:58.520,00:30:59.600,你携带病原,,,
00:30:59.600,00:31:00.680,你不控制,,,
00:31:00.880,00:31:01.800,他到处跑,,,
00:31:01.800,00:31:03.920,他就会传播更多的人,,,
00:31:04.200,00:31:06.040,那么其他地方的这样一个,,,
00:31:06.080,00:31:09.600,人民群众卫生体系比较差,00:31:04.240,00:31:11.420," For countries with weak health systems or economies,"
00:31:09.640,00:31:11.640,或者经济比较差的国家,,,
00:31:11.720,00:31:14.240,他们没有这种强大的,,,
00:31:14.280,00:31:17.240,支持能力和防疫的能力,00:31:12.160,00:31:17.540,they did not have the capabilities to sustain and prevent an epidemic.
00:31:17.280,00:31:20.000,所以他并没有这样一个幸运,00:31:17.540,00:31:21.900,So they would not be as lucky as America in terms of death rate.
00:31:20.120,00:31:21.560,那么这么多人被救治,,,
00:31:22.280,00:31:23.240,您的意思就是说,,,
00:31:23.240,00:31:26.480,他没有给出非常明确的一些控制,00:31:22.300,00:31:27.160,"You mean, the United States did not define
the procedure to control the spread."
00:31:26.480,00:31:28.000,它蔓延的方法,,,
00:31:28.000,00:31:29.680,本地我可以解决,00:31:27.380,00:31:29.500,"They could handle it domestically,"
00:31:29.680,00:31:31.760,但如果你自由流动到别的地方,,,
00:31:31.760,00:31:32.960,我就一概不管了,00:31:29.500,00:31:35.360,"but they didn’t care about people travelling to
other countries and their local medical capabilities."
00:31:32.960,00:31:34.720,看你自己的医疗条件怎么样,,,
00:31:34.720,00:31:34.920,是,,,
00:31:36.800,00:31:37.440,他实际上,,,
00:31:37.440,00:31:38.920,你要在西方长期生活,,,
00:31:38.960,00:31:39.960,你就知道了,00:31:35.560,00:31:43.040,"If you have lived in the West long enough, you would
know that they don’t have such mobilization abilities."
00:31:40.320,00:31:42.880,他不可能有这样的动员能力,,,
00:31:42.920,00:31:44.800,像刚才工程师,00:31:43.040,00:31:45.740,"Engineers in China can leave on short notice,"
00:31:44.800,00:31:45.560,今天命令,,,
00:31:45.560,00:31:46.360,明天就出发,,,
00:31:46.400,00:31:47.160,就这样,,,
00:31:47.360,00:31:48.960,西方这个不行的,00:31:45.740,00:31:48.820,but their western counterparts can't.
00:31:49.000,00:31:49.640,穿的还是no,,,
00:31:49.720,00:31:53.480, The天,,,
00:31:55.280,00:31:56.400, test,,,
00:31:56.440,00:32:00.160, Plus txt,,,
00:32:00.800,00:32:02.360, my next,,,
00:32:02.360,00:32:03.960,Night,,,
00:32:05.200,00:32:05.960, after you,,,
00:32:06.000,00:32:07.000,What APP看去,,,
00:32:07.000,00:32:09.040,IOUO人数,,,
00:32:09.040,00:32:09.880,有great,,,
00:32:11.000,00:32:12.440,西方的模式,,,
00:32:12.960,00:32:14.000,它特点是,00:32:11.240,00:32:16.060,"The Western systems are characterized
by having a complete procedure."
00:32:14.000,00:32:15.960,它有一整套完整的程序,,,
00:32:16.000,00:32:17.720,他一般做法就程序走完了,00:32:16.060,00:32:18.800,"Generally, you don’t care as long as you have followed through the procedure."
00:32:17.720,00:32:18.520,我就不管了,,,
00:32:18.760,00:32:21.200,还合同我还在休假,00:32:18.800,00:32:20.940,"- I have my contract.
- I'm on vacation."
00:32:21.320,00:32:22.680,我总统都可以继续休假,00:32:21.100,00:32:23.760," Even the president can do so.
This is the “spirit of contract”."
00:32:22.680,00:32:23.920,他这叫契约,,,
00:32:23.960,00:32:26.200,看澳大利亚山火烧成那样了,00:32:23.760,00:32:28.280,"Like the Australian Prime Minister could
go on vacation amid the bushfire crisis."
00:32:26.200,00:32:27.280,他们的政府首脑,,,
00:32:27.280,00:32:27.960,还该休假,,,
00:32:28.000,00:32:28.920,该收钱,,,
00:32:28.960,00:32:30.560,我老说中国在重新界定,00:32:28.280,00:32:31.440,"Yes, I often say that China is redefining modernization."
00:32:30.600,00:32:31.640,什么叫现代化,,,
00:32:31.880,00:32:32.360,现代化,,,
00:32:32.360,00:32:34.520,你要适应各种各样的新的挑战,00:32:32.120,00:32:34.960,Modernization has to adapt to all kinds of new challenges.
00:32:35.200,00:32:36.360,你先的制度,,,
00:32:36.400,00:32:37.320,西方的字,00:32:34.960,00:32:38.120,The Western systems are facing a lot of them.
00:32:37.320,00:32:38.880,真的遇到巨大的挑战,,,
00:32:39.280,00:32:42.000,世卫总干事老是在强调说了好几,,,
00:32:42.000,00:32:42.600,次了,00:32:39.240,00:32:44.840,"Just as WHO Director General said,
China is setting a new standard."
00:32:42.600,00:32:44.840,中国创造一种新的标准,,,
00:32:45.440,00:32:46.320,一种新的标杆,00:32:45.380,00:32:46.960,A new type of benchmark.
00:32:47.000,00:32:48.080,实际上武汉分成,,,
00:32:48.080,00:32:50.520,现在为什么谈德赛,00:32:46.960,00:32:50.860,Why did Tedros Adhanom stand up and speak for China
00:32:50.520,00:32:51.880,面对西方其它舆论,,,
00:32:51.880,00:32:53.240,他要站出来为我们说话,00:32:50.860,00:32:53.600,when questioned by the western media about Wuhan’s lockdown?
00:32:53.920,00:32:54.960,因为,,,
00:32:55.000,00:32:57.920,们这些专家深深的感觉到,,,
00:32:58.240,00:32:59.320,中国做得,00:32:53.600,00:33:02.880," It is because the experts deeply feel that China has
done more than its share in epidemic control."
00:32:59.320,00:32:59.640,实际上,,,
00:32:59.640,00:33:03.160,已经超过了一般的防疫要求了,,,
00:33:03.320,00:33:06.040,你就可以看到目前的日本,00:33:03.520,00:33:08.120,"As you can see, it is currently impossible for countries
like Japan and Singapore to do the same."
00:33:06.240,00:33:07.880,包括新加坡,,,
00:33:08.360,00:33:10.560,他们都不可能去做这样一件事,00:33:08.500,00:33:12.420,Their current reactions are basically the same:
00:33:10.560,00:33:12.160,他们现在基本,,,
00:33:12.160,00:33:12.480,你看,,,
00:33:12.480,00:33:14.160,他们的行为都是一样的,,,
00:33:14.280,00:33:16.480,一个是成立一个应急小组,,,
00:33:16.480,00:33:17.760,各个部长进去,,,
00:33:17.800,00:33:19.520,然后准备一些钱,00:33:12.620,00:33:23.400,"Form an emergency team involving various ministers,
prepare funding, supplies, and masks, then wait for it to spread."
00:33:19.520,00:33:20.760,准备一些物资,,,
00:33:20.800,00:33:21.800,发一些口罩,,,
00:33:21.800,00:33:23.280,然后就等着蔓延,,,
00:33:23.880,00:33:26.120,然后卫生部门做好准备,00:33:23.920,00:33:26.240,The health departments are prepared for intensive care.
00:33:26.120,00:33:27.360,就接受重症,,,
00:33:27.360,00:33:28.560,那么他们这么做,,,
00:33:28.680,00:33:31.080,其实坦率说,00:33:26.320,00:33:35.200,They did so based on Wuhan’s experience.
00:33:31.120,00:33:36.200,也是根据我们武汉的经验得出的,,,
00:33:36.240,00:33:37.400,网络上现在有句话,,,
00:33:37.720,00:33:40.200,我们是闭卷考,,,
00:33:40.200,00:33:41.760,他们是开卷考,00:33:36.380,00:33:46.880,"The Internet says “China had a closed-book exam
while they had an open-book exam and still failed.”"
00:33:41.800,00:33:42.800,可以抄对,,,
00:33:43.040,00:33:44.680,但他们开卷考,,,
00:33:44.800,00:33:46.840,网上的评论是也没及格,,,
00:33:47.920,00:33:48.680,因为这个疫情,,,
00:33:48.680,00:33:49.800,对任何一个人,,,
00:33:49.800,00:33:51.680,任何一个组织和政府来说,00:33:47.940,00:33:54.140,"The coronavirus is a completely new challenge for
any individual, any organization, and any government."
00:33:51.720,00:33:54.200,它都是完全新的一个挑战,,,
00:33:54.240,00:33:56.240,国际社会对我们有非常正面的,00:33:54.140,00:33:56.640,"The international community made some very positive comments about China,"
00:33:56.240,00:33:56.720,评价,,,
00:33:56.720,00:33:57.760,但我们也注意到,,,
00:33:57.760,00:34:00.400,有一些西方媒体在污泥话,00:33:56.640,00:34:00.220,but some Western media are stigmatizing China
00:34:00.440,00:34:01.360,甚至还影响了,,,
00:34:01.360,00:34:02.080,对中国文化,,,
00:34:02.080,00:34:03.680,对中国人的认识,00:34:00.460,00:34:03.720,"which affected people’s understanding of
the Chinese people and Chinese culture."
00:34:04.160,00:34:05.320,我们也有一位观众,,,
00:34:05.360,00:34:06.520,非常热爱我们的节目,,,
00:34:06.520,00:34:08.960,她是一位在纽约的留学生,00:34:03.720,00:34:11.100,"We have an audience who is an international student
in New York, Dai Yuxiao,"
00:34:09.000,00:34:10.680,他就根据自己的观察,,,
00:34:10.680,00:34:11.880,她有很多困惑,,,
00:34:11.880,00:34:12.800,她叫戴雨潇,,,
00:34:12.800,00:34:14.480,我们现在马上来连线她,00:34:11.480,00:34:16.640,and we will connect with him and hear his questions.
00:34:14.680,00:34:15.600,听听他的问题,,,
00:34:15.600,00:34:17.240,听听他的困惑是什么,,,
00:34:17.440,00:34:18.320,你好戴雨潇,,,
00:34:18.520,00:34:19.440,主持人好,00:34:17.440,00:34:20.040,"- Hello, Yuxiao.
- Hello."
00:34:19.520,00:34:20.080,你好,,,
00:34:20.160,00:34:22.320,我知道这段时间你也非常关心,,,
00:34:22.320,00:34:24.720,我们在抗击肺炎疫情的前后火,00:34:20.260,00:34:25.380,"Hello. I learned you’ve been closely following
the updates of the coronavirus at home."
00:34:24.720,00:34:25.640,整个经过,,,
00:34:25.680,00:34:26.600,也很想听一下,,,
00:34:26.600,00:34:28.040,你在国外的观察是什么,,,
00:34:28.040,00:34:29.680,另外知道你有困惑,00:34:25.740,00:34:31.380,"I would like to know how things are going for you,
and what your question is."
00:34:29.680,00:34:30.480,你能告诉我,,,
00:34:30.480,00:34:31.800,你困惑什么吗,,,
00:34:33.560,00:34:34.320,好的,,,
00:34:34.360,00:34:36.520,病这一天在社交网络,,,
00:34:36.520,00:34:39.520,还有日常生活当中,00:34:33.500,00:34:44.700,"Recently on social media and in our daily life, many
people in the US or Europe are saying “Go back to China.”"
00:34:39.520,00:34:40.800,就在比如在美国,,,
00:34:40.800,00:34:41.760,或者在欧洲,,,
00:34:41.800,00:34:42.880,很多西方人,,,
00:34:42.920,00:34:45.280,会直接让海外华人滚回中国,,,
00:34:45.320,00:34:47.080,有的直接叫嚣中国人,00:34:45.380,00:34:48.200,Some even said “All Chinese people should die”.
00:34:47.080,00:34:48.200,都应该去死,,,
00:34:48.480,00:34:50.440,两周前我所在的纽约,,,
00:34:50.440,00:34:51.800,竟然爆发了一个事件,00:34:48.440,00:34:52.900,A hate attack happened two weeks ago here in New York City.
00:34:51.800,00:34:53.160,是一个中国留学生,,,
00:34:53.160,00:34:54.720,因为戴着口罩,,,
00:34:54.800,00:34:57.760,就被人给从地铁上推到铁轨上去,00:34:53.220,00:34:57.700,"A Chinese student was pushed onto subway tracks
because she was wearing a mask."
00:34:58.240,00:34:59.640,然后但是我们发现,,,
00:34:59.640,00:35:02.760,过去美国本身在处理灾害面前,00:34:58.380,00:35:04.220,"We've learned in the past that the US could not respond
to [natural] disasters better than China,"
00:35:02.800,00:35:03.960,无法比中国,,,
00:35:04.040,00:35:04.360,好的,,,
00:35:04.920,00:35:06.800,但是他们依然在指责,,,
00:35:06.800,00:35:08.240,只有对中国制度化解,00:35:04.960,00:35:08.680,but the Americans are still blaming and only blaming China.
00:35:08.240,00:35:09.680,所以我想请问一下,,,
00:35:09.680,00:35:10.320,张教授,,,
00:35:10.360,00:35:11.880,和其他来宾,,,
00:35:12.240,00:35:13.920,面对这样的一种情况,00:35:08.680,00:35:18.060,"So my question is, facing the current situation,
what can the Chinese expats and emigrants do"
00:35:14.200,00:35:15.920,我们中国人,,,
00:35:15.920,00:35:16.320,以及包括,,,
00:35:16.400,00:35:18.160,在海外爱国华人华侨,,,
00:35:18.160,00:35:19.760,他们能做些什么,,,
00:35:19.760,00:35:22.000,来扭转惯用的,,,
00:35:22.200,00:35:23.960,西方中心主义的视角,00:35:18.780,00:35:26.220,"to change their Western-centrism perspectives,
their stigmatization and discrimination?"
00:35:24.080,00:35:26.040,来对我们进行污名化的歧视,,,
00:35:26.080,00:35:27.320,我们怎么样让,,,
00:35:27.360,00:35:29.880,们用实事求是和更正常的,00:35:26.480,00:35:31.500,How can we make them see China as it is?
00:35:30.200,00:35:31.720,去看待中国,,,
00:35:32.080,00:35:32.760,这就,,,
00:35:33.040,00:35:33.680,好好,00:35:32.120,00:35:33.800,That's my question.
00:35:33.680,00:35:34.640,谢谢戴雨潇,,,
00:35:34.640,00:35:36.240,我们也通过这样的一段连线,00:35:33.800,00:35:38.020,"Thank you, Yuxiao."
00:35:36.280,00:35:38.320,了解到了观众的困惑,,,
00:35:38.320,00:35:40.400,身在海外的这些留学生,,,
00:35:40.400,00:35:41.160,这些华人群体,,,
00:35:41.160,00:35:42.440,他们会感受到压力,00:35:38.580,00:35:45.000,"The Chinese communities abroad have felt
the pressure and stigmatization."
00:35:42.440,00:35:44.120,因为最近确实有污名化,,,
00:35:44.120,00:35:45.560,中国人的行为,,,
00:35:45.560,00:35:45.960,张老师,,,
00:35:45.960,00:35:47.280,您怎么来解答他的问题,00:35:45.600,00:35:47.460,"Professor Zhang, what do you think?"
00:35:47.880,00:35:52.040,实际上西方种族主义也好,,,
00:35:52.080,00:35:54.520,对中国的文化偏见也好,00:35:47.760,00:35:57.900,"Actually, racism, cultural biases against China, and
ideological prejudice have always been there."
00:35:54.800,00:35:56.560,意识形态的偏见也好,,,
00:35:57.080,00:35:58.240,一直在这,,,
00:35:58.600,00:36:01.200,只是现在因为有一个引擎,,,
00:36:01.200,00:36:03.280,所以好像给他们一个,00:35:58.660,00:36:06.060,"But now the outbreaks offered them a
new chance to “kick us when we’re down.”"
00:36:03.280,00:36:05.880,落井下石的新的机会,,,
00:36:07.240,00:36:08.720,所以我觉得这个问题,,,
00:36:08.720,00:36:10.360,首先你要可以看到,00:36:07.340,00:36:12.320,"To answer this question, we must first see that the problem has always been there,"
00:36:10.360,00:36:13.720,这原来就现在只是突然显示出来,,,
00:36:13.720,00:36:14.080,了,00:36:12.320,00:36:15.200,and has just become more prominent now.
00:36:14.160,00:36:15.320,更突出了,,,
00:36:15.600,00:36:16.440,但我注意到,,,
00:36:16.440,00:36:16.880,这一次,,,
00:36:17.240,00:36:21.160,几乎在这些公开的搞种族主义,00:36:15.600,00:36:23.280,"However, I noticed people who are
inflaming racism and cultural prejudice"
00:36:21.200,00:36:22.520,搞文化偏见的,,,
00:36:22.560,00:36:24.040,这种舆论一出来,,,
00:36:24.040,00:36:26.920,实际上在西方社会也有很多反弹,00:36:24.200,00:36:28.560,"have also been widely criticized within western societies,
even more strongly than the past"
00:36:26.960,00:36:28.800,甚至反弹比过去要剧烈,,,
00:36:28.800,00:36:30.320,因为它确实践踏了,,,
00:36:30.360,00:36:32.040,人类文明的底线,00:36:29.000,00:36:32.260,as these people are trampling on the bottom line of humanity.
00:36:32.720,00:36:35.440,第二我觉得不要太担心,00:36:32.780,00:36:34.780,"Second, don't worry too much."
00:36:35.440,00:36:37.640,因为这个疫情很快就会过去,00:36:35.520,00:36:37.520,The epidemic will be over soon.
00:36:38.040,00:36:40.080,实际上我知道很多老外,,,
00:36:40.160,00:36:41.640,他内心是,00:36:38.020,00:36:45.860,"I’m aware that many foreigners have been
shocked by the China Model for the first time."
00:36:42.800,00:36:46.440,被整个国家中国模式给震撼了,,,
00:36:47.200,00:36:50.200,14亿人同时戴口罩,,,
00:36:50.440,00:36:52.880,可以一起呆在家里,00:36:46.660,00:36:54.700,"1.4 billion people put on masks all together and
stay at home to go through this difficult time."
00:36:52.880,00:36:53.800,宅在家里,,,
00:36:53.800,00:36:55.240,把这关度过去,,,
00:36:55.520,00:36:56.560,这么多的人,,,
00:36:56.560,00:36:58.280,一一批的护士,,,
00:36:58.280,00:36:59.880,解放军医务人员,00:36:55.520,00:37:01.280,"Our nurses, PLA soldiers, and medical workers rushed to
the front line one batch after another."
00:36:59.880,00:37:01.280,冲到前线去,,,
00:37:01.600,00:37:03.320,这在西方是不可思议的,00:37:01.580,00:37:03.620,This is unimaginable in the West.
00:37:03.360,00:37:05.000,我们前面分析一个案例,,,
00:37:05.000,00:37:06.040,就是09年的,,,
00:37:06.960,00:37:08.720, H 1N1的案例,00:37:03.620,00:37:09.220,"We could see the examples we mentioned earlier
that the United States did terribly in the past."
00:37:08.720,00:37:09.760,就美国做得很糟,,,
00:37:09.800,00:37:11.560,更不要说你听了卡特里娜了,00:37:09.540,00:37:11.960,"For example, Hurricane Katrina in 2005."
00:37:12.080,00:37:13.080,稍微再等等,,,
00:37:13.080,00:37:14.160,他们可以看到了,00:37:11.960,00:37:15.060,"If we give them some time, they will understand China better."
00:37:15.320,00:37:16.840,他们对中国认识,,,
00:37:16.880,00:37:17.440,有一个,,,
00:37:17.440,00:37:19.480,逐步了解和深化的过程,00:37:15.720,00:37:19.800,"It’s a gradual process to understand
China and deepen their understanding."
00:37:20.080,00:37:20.840,你看黛玉笑,,,
00:37:20.840,00:37:22.840,他可能也问出了很多留学生的,00:37:20.080,00:37:23.480,"Yuxiao’s question is probably one that
many Chinese students abroad also have."
00:37:22.840,00:37:23.600,心声,,,
00:37:23.640,00:37:24.600,您刚也说了,,,
00:37:24.600,00:37:25.360,我们可以讲到了,00:37:23.840,00:37:26.040,But what if we are just trying to talk sense into people unreasonable?
00:37:25.360,00:37:26.520,万一对方不讲道理,,,
00:37:26.520,00:37:26.680,对,,,
00:37:26.800,00:37:29.040,我觉得要保护好自己,00:37:26.600,00:37:28.600,Protect yourselves.
00:37:29.040,00:37:31.200,因为现在总体上,,,
00:37:31.200,00:37:32.720,西方今天最大问题,00:37:29.060,00:37:34.380,"One big problem in the West is that in the past 20 years,"
00:37:33.640,00:37:34.920,过去20来年,,,
00:37:34.920,00:37:37.560,多数人的实际收入没有增加,00:37:34.380,00:37:39.200,"the actual income of most people did not increase,
and the rich-poor divide has widened."
00:37:37.840,00:37:39.160,贫富差距拉大了,,,
00:37:39.160,00:37:40.960,所以很多人他有怨气,,,
00:37:40.960,00:37:42.400,这不光是针对中国,00:37:39.440,00:37:43.060,"Many people are angry, not only because of China."
00:37:42.400,00:37:44.360,你看整个从EMAIL过为例,,,
00:37:44.480,00:37:46.440,特朗普上台以后,00:37:43.300,00:37:49.540,"Take the US an example, one year since
President Trump took office,"
00:37:46.560,00:37:48.160,他们叫仇恨罪行,,,
00:37:48.200,00:37:49.160,就是憎恨,,,
00:37:49.200,00:37:50.720,由于种族问题,,,
00:37:50.720,00:37:51.480,民族问题,,,
00:37:51.480,00:37:52.640,文化问题,,,
00:37:52.640,00:37:53.560,各种各样偏见,,,
00:37:53.560,00:37:55.080,这种仇恨的犯罪,00:37:49.860,00:37:57.480,"hate crimes concerning race, ethnicity, and cultures increased by 17%."
00:37:55.160,00:37:56.360,提高了17%,,,
00:37:56.360,00:37:58.000,上升了一年之内,,,
00:37:58.160,00:38:00.000,所以我不感觉铺满了干柴,00:37:57.800,00:38:01.880,"I would not say ""they have filled the firewood to burn us”,
but the hate has a solid foundation."
00:38:00.040,00:38:01.840,但是确实是有基础的,,,
00:38:01.960,00:38:03.360,但如果大家能够讲道理,,,
00:38:03.400,00:38:04.960,我们可以说得清清楚楚,00:38:01.880,00:38:05.000,We can make ourselves clear to reasonable people.
00:38:05.520,00:38:06.960,那么而且我想西方也有很多,,,
00:38:06.960,00:38:07.560,有识之士,00:38:05.600,00:38:09.420,"I believe there are many reasonable people
in the West and they can be our allies."
00:38:07.560,00:38:08.080,可以团结,,,
00:38:08.080,00:38:09.160,他们一起来做,,,
00:38:09.160,00:38:11.200,就是大一之后,,,
00:38:11.320,00:38:14.120,就像跟随而来的叫信息文艺,00:38:10.180,00:38:13.420,An infodemic usually follows an epidemic.
00:38:14.280,00:38:15.800,近期比较敏感的,,,
00:38:15.800,00:38:16.320,就是,,,
00:38:16.320,00:38:17.920,关于华尔街日报说,00:38:14.240,00:38:21.240,"The Wall Street Journal's article “China Is the
Real Sick Man of Asia"" has been very controversial."
00:38:17.920,00:38:20.200,亚洲病夫马sick,,,
00:38:20.240,00:38:21.480,Man of A选,,,
00:38:22.040,00:38:24.360,实际上我北美的,,,
00:38:24.360,00:38:27.760,中国卫生政策学会的一个教授,00:38:21.740,00:38:30.920,"A professor at China Health Policy and Management Society
wrote to the Wall Street Journal to refute the article."
00:38:27.800,00:38:29.960,他其实写信给华尔街日报,,,
00:38:29.960,00:38:30.640,就驳斥了,,,
00:38:30.680,00:38:31.200,这个事情,,,
00:38:31.200,00:38:33.960,我觉得在除了张教授说的,00:38:31.620,00:38:35.420,"I think, in addition to what Prof. Zhang said ""protect yourselves”,"
00:38:34.200,00:38:35.320,保护好自己,,,
00:38:35.520,00:38:37.760,另外我们如果是一个专业人士,,,
00:38:37.760,00:38:39.040,实际上可以对,00:38:35.420,00:38:42.340, all the professionals can publish professional opinions to refute misinformation.
00:38:39.040,00:38:42.560,他的观点与专业上的驳斥,,,
00:38:42.920,00:38:43.440,这是一个,,,
00:38:43.440,00:38:46.760,因为你其实防住信息瘟疫,00:38:42.880,00:38:50.760,"Preventing the spread of the infodemic
will help the prevention the epidemic."
00:38:46.960,00:38:49.960,也有利于中国的防疫,,,
00:38:49.960,00:38:51.360,这样一件事情,,,
00:38:51.800,00:38:53.680,其实说到新官肺炎,,,
00:38:53.760,00:38:54.560,刚才我们也说了,,,
00:38:54.560,00:38:55.640,它是一个新生事物,00:38:51.760,00:38:57.680,"We said this coronavirus is new,
and it’s a gradual process to understand it."
00:38:55.640,00:38:56.560,我们对他的了解,,,
00:38:56.600,00:38:57.520,他是有一个,,,
00:38:59.200,00:39:00.920,对我们的公共卫生体系来说,00:38:58.360,00:39:02.200,This also poses a huge challenge to our public health system.
00:39:00.920,00:39:02.560,它也提出了巨大的挑战,,,
00:39:02.560,00:39:04.160,大家也通过疫情的发展,,,
00:39:04.160,00:39:05.360,一直在观察,00:39:02.660,00:39:06.600,I believe we all have our observations as the epidemic evolves.
00:39:05.400,00:39:06.800,我们整个公共卫生体系,,,
00:39:06.840,00:39:07.760,还应该怎么样,,,
00:39:07.800,00:39:09.000,做的更加健全,00:39:06.600,00:39:09.600, in terms of how the public health system should  improve.
00:39:09.000,00:39:09.760,更加完善,,,
00:39:09.840,00:39:11.560,您作为这方面的专业人士,00:39:10.000,00:39:12.900,"Professor Cai, you are an expert in public health."
00:39:11.600,00:39:13.240,我也想听听您的观察,,,
00:39:13.680,00:39:15.240,我们原有的公共卫生体系,00:39:13.120,00:39:16.360,We’d like to hear your opinion on how our health systems should improve.
00:39:15.240,00:39:15.760,哪些地方,,,
00:39:15.800,00:39:16.720,我们还要补充,,,
00:39:17.320,00:39:18.400,这次的疫情,,,
00:39:18.720,00:39:20.320,就是网上有很多说法,00:39:17.420,00:39:22.980,"There are many buzzwords on the Internet about this
epidemic, such as “the black swan” and “the gray rhino”."
00:39:20.320,00:39:21.800,什么黑天鹅,,,
00:39:21.960,00:39:23.240,灰犀牛,,,
00:39:23.280,00:39:26.000,其实它有很多原因,00:39:23.440,00:39:25.880,There are many external reasons.
00:39:26.000,00:39:27.040,比如说外部原因,,,
00:39:27.160,00:39:27.880,就是我们中国,,,
00:39:28.920,00:39:30.120,飞速的发展,00:39:26.060,00:39:33.080,"First, the rapid growth of China has condensed
centuries into a short period of time."
00:39:30.120,00:39:31.280,就几百年的发展,,,
00:39:31.320,00:39:33.560,浓缩到了一段时间,,,
00:39:33.560,00:39:35.840,这个就是社会经济的复杂性增加,,,
00:39:35.840,00:39:36.040,了,,,
00:39:36.040,00:39:39.080,所以掌控起来比较难,00:39:33.420,00:39:38.700,"This has increased China's socioeconomic complexity
and the difficulty to take control."
00:39:39.160,00:39:41.120,第2个由于经济发展,,,
00:39:41.280,00:39:44.160,有时候会忽略公共服务,00:39:39.280,00:39:45.540,"Second, when we focus on economic growth,
we sometimes overlooked public services."
00:39:44.200,00:39:46.280,这是第2个原因,,,
00:39:46.280,00:39:47.600,第3个外部原因,,,
00:39:47.720,00:39:50.000,其实就是谭德赛说了,,,
00:39:50.000,00:39:51.080,他说了一个很好的,00:39:46.360,00:39:53.720,"Third, I'll read what Tedros Adhanom said,"
00:39:51.760,00:39:53.400,我想念一念,,,
00:39:53.640,00:39:57.120,他说这个世界一直在恐慌与忽视,00:39:54.680,00:39:58.460,"""For too long, the world has operated
on a cycle of panic and neglect."""
00:39:57.120,00:39:57.280,中,,,
00:39:57.320,00:39:58.160,循环往复,,,
00:39:58.600,00:40:00.480,在疫情爆发时候,,,
00:40:00.720,00:40:02.520,往往投入大量的资金,,,
00:40:02.560,00:40:03.640,但是疫情结束,00:39:58.460,00:40:07.460,"""We throw money at an outbreak, and when it’s over,
we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one."""
00:40:04.080,00:40:04.840,就会遗忘,,,
00:40:04.880,00:40:07.080,而不采取任何措施,,,
00:40:07.080,00:40:08.920,阻止下一次疫情爆发,,,
00:40:08.960,00:40:10.680,它其实是在两月10五号,,,
00:40:10.880,00:40:12.680,慕尼黑会议上讲的,00:40:07.460,00:40:14.900,"He said this at a conference in Munich on February 15th,
and this is human nature."
00:40:13.560,00:40:14.560,人的天性,,,
00:40:14.760,00:40:18.320,就SARS起来发展结束,00:40:14.900,00:40:17.560,"SARS broke out, evolved, and ended."
00:40:18.360,00:40:19.840,那么大家都意识到,,,
00:40:19.880,00:40:21.520,公共卫生体系非常重要,00:40:17.560,00:40:23.540,Everyone recognized the importance of a good public health system and started building a network.
00:40:21.560,00:40:23.800,所以开始构建这样一个网络,,,
00:40:24.080,00:40:26.560,慢慢的就是已经17年了,,,
00:40:27.040,00:40:28.760,就慢慢的他会出现一些问题,00:40:23.980,00:40:32.880,"But after 17 years, some problems have emerged
such as “strong treatment and weak prevention”."
00:40:28.760,00:40:32.920,那么其中一个问题叫重医轻防,,,
00:40:33.280,00:40:34.840,因为对政府来说,,,
00:40:35.240,00:40:36.480,你治多少病,00:40:33.080,00:40:37.900,"Because for the government, you can see how many cases
have been treated, how many lives have been saved;"
00:40:36.480,00:40:37.120,救多少人,,,
00:40:37.120,00:40:38.040,你看得到,,,
00:40:38.200,00:40:39.640,但是你预防了多少,00:40:38.180,00:40:40.680,but you cannot see how many cases have been prevented.
00:40:39.760,00:40:42.080,你越预防不发生事情,,,
00:40:42.160,00:40:42.920,那越看不到,00:40:40.680,00:40:43.960,"And the more you prevent, fewer will
happen and the less you will see."
00:40:42.960,00:40:45.080,越看不到第3个原因,,,
00:40:45.120,00:40:45.880,就是,,,
00:40:45.920,00:40:46.880,我有个数据,,,
00:40:49.320,00:40:49.960,12年,00:40:44.380,00:40:54.080,"Fourth, my data shows that in 2012, if 15 graduates were
employed by a disease control center in Shanghai,"
00:40:50.600,00:40:52.080,比如说15个学生,,,
00:40:52.080,00:40:54.440,进上海某个集控,,,
00:40:54.440,00:40:56.360,那么可能5年后,,,
00:40:56.640,00:40:59.600,2/3的人都要流失,00:40:54.320,00:40:59.320,about two-thirds of them would leave in 5 years.
00:40:59.640,00:41:03.960,原因是由于资金加上重视程度,,,
00:41:03.960,00:41:04.440,下降,00:40:59.840,00:41:08.760,"Attraction to talent has declined due to
shrinking funding and lowering government priority."
00:41:04.520,00:41:07.360,导致对人才的这样一个,,,
00:41:07.720,00:41:09.440,吸引力下降,,,
00:41:09.560,00:41:12.160,还有一个是兼于外部和内部是,,,
00:41:12.160,00:41:12.400,什么,,,
00:41:12.920,00:41:15.640,原来我们急性传染病很厉害,00:41:09.720,00:41:15.500,"An external and internal reason is that
acute infectious diseases used to be very severe"
00:41:15.840,00:41:17.760,以前我们中国也有甲流,,,
00:41:17.840,00:41:18.200,什么,,,
00:41:18.240,00:41:20.640,包括什么处暑,00:41:15.780,00:41:21.680,"China had Influenza A, mouse plague, and schistosomiasis."
00:41:20.640,00:41:22.160,一血吸虫,,,
00:41:22.160,00:41:25.200,但是现在我们生活水平提高了,00:41:22.200,00:41:27.040,"But as our living standards improves, we are mainly
facing chronic diseases such as cancer,"
00:41:25.240,00:41:26.720,就变成慢性病了,,,
00:41:26.800,00:41:28.560,那么工位的职能,,,
00:41:28.560,00:41:30.000,相当于也转移了,00:41:27.040,00:41:30.900,which means public health has taken on a different role.
00:41:30.120,00:41:30.760,大家都对,,,
00:41:32.080,00:41:34.600,前面谈的再说的容易遗忘,00:41:31.820,00:41:34.200,"So we have become forgetful, as Tedros Adhanom said."
00:41:34.600,00:41:35.880,现在是癌症,00:41:34.200,00:41:36.480,We mainly worry about cancer now.
00:41:36.160,00:41:36.960,这些,,,
00:41:37.000,00:41:39.160,赞助到这些综合的因素,,,
00:41:39.280,00:41:40.240,可能是,,,
00:41:40.360,00:41:42.920,而导致这次这样一个爆发,00:41:36.980,00:41:47.240,"All these reasons combined can explain why we were
caught off guard by the sudden outbreak of the epidemic."
00:41:42.920,00:41:45.480,我们可能刚开始,,,
00:41:46.080,00:41:47.800,有一点措不及防,,,
00:41:47.800,00:41:49.120,有这样一个原因,,,
00:41:49.400,00:41:51.880,实际上刚才蔡老师讲,00:41:49.400,00:41:53.160,What Professor Cai just said makes a lot of sense.
00:41:52.040,00:41:53.120,我觉得很有道理,,,
00:41:53.480,00:41:56.160,因为这公共卫生是预防为主的,00:41:53.160,00:41:58.560,"As public health focuses on prevention, it’s like
“You raise an army for a thousand days but use it just for one.”"
00:41:56.920,00:41:58.800,养兵千日用兵一时,,,
00:41:58.800,00:42:01.240,然后用兵一时的时候很重要,,,
00:42:01.280,00:42:03.520,那么养兵千日是怎么个养法,00:41:58.900,00:42:05.760,"The one day at war is important, but a lot of research
can be done into how we ""raise the army""."
00:42:03.800,00:42:06.200,我觉得这个也有很多文章可以做,,,
00:42:06.680,00:42:07.040,对,,,
00:42:07.040,00:42:07.720,通过这次,,,
00:42:08.240,00:42:09.480,我们也不要盲目的,,,
00:42:09.480,00:42:10.000,去,,,
00:42:10.000,00:42:12.040,像SARS这样扩展很多,00:42:07.040,00:42:12.960,"This time, we also learned that we should not be blindly
extensive like our SARS response, and we must be precise."
00:42:12.040,00:42:13.080,而是要精准,,,
00:42:13.440,00:42:15.440,你科学测算需要多少人,00:42:13.300,00:42:17.020,"We need to calculate how many people we need
for the safety nets at community levels,"
00:42:15.480,00:42:17.200,就把网底补助,,,
00:42:17.200,00:42:19.120,因为如果你没有好的人,,,
00:42:19.120,00:42:20.520,你又支持不足,00:42:17.380,00:42:22.680,"and equip communities with
competent personnel and adequate support."
00:42:20.640,00:42:21.920,你往底漏了你,,,
00:42:22.760,00:42:24.280,真的灾难来临,,,
00:42:24.280,00:42:26.800,你就措手不及了,00:42:22.920,00:42:27.240,"Otherwise, we will be caught unprepared by a disaster."
00:42:28.080,00:42:28.800,是,,,
00:42:28.840,00:42:30.440,其实新官肺炎疫情,,,
00:42:30.440,00:42:31.480,还在发展当中,,,
00:42:31.480,00:42:33.000,但是我们都已经看到了,,,
00:42:33.000,00:42:35.760,向好的希望曙光在前,00:42:28.820,00:42:39.100,"Although the epidemic is still evolving, we have seen
data showing that things are changing for the good."
00:42:35.880,00:42:37.720,因为这个是有数据支撑的,,,
00:42:37.720,00:42:40.240,给了我们这样一种信心,,,
00:42:40.320,00:42:41.320,不同观点可以,00:42:39.600,00:42:42.840,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:42:41.360,00:42:43.200,互相讨论辩论,,,
00:42:44.400,00:42:46.360,我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:42:44.300,00:42:46.300,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:42:46.800,00:42:48.360,中国人你要自信,00:42:46.840,00:42:48.840,"China, be confident."
00:42:49.960,00:42:53.440,这就是中国青张维为说,,,
00:42:54.640,00:42:58.360,这就是中国青张维为说,00:42:50.020,00:42:58.520,"China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:43:00.920,00:43:02.360,站在现在这个时间点上,,,
00:43:02.360,00:43:04.200,我们来回顾疫情的整个发展,00:43:00.900,00:43:06.780,"What else do you want to add about the development of
the coronavirus and our response?"
00:43:04.200,00:43:05.640,和我们的应对两位,,,
00:43:05.640,00:43:07.200,还有一些什么样的感想,,,
00:43:07.680,00:43:08.680,我就补充一点,,,
00:43:09.520,00:43:11.480,我们作为一个国家,00:43:07.640,00:43:13.920,"I would like to add that, like the Russian scholar
[Sergey Alexandrovich] Markov said,"
00:43:11.720,00:43:14.240,我前面引用俄罗斯学者说的,,,
00:43:14.360,00:43:19.040,单独承担了大的损失牺牲,,,
00:43:19.320,00:43:20.960,但我相信,,,
00:43:21.120,00:43:22.560,我前面我也提到的,00:43:14.320,00:43:28.520,"we endured great loss and sacrifice as a country,
but I believe the world will acknowledge that."
00:43:22.560,00:43:24.920,就是这种牺牲,,,
00:43:25.160,00:43:26.720,这种付出,,,
00:43:26.960,00:43:28.840,全世界是看在眼里的,,,
00:43:29.240,00:43:30.520,所以我自己觉得,,,
00:43:31.000,00:43:33.520,在战役胜利之后,00:43:29.320,00:43:33.200,"I am hopeful when we’ve won the war against the coronavirus,"
00:43:34.080,00:43:35.360,中国模式,,,
00:43:35.360,00:43:36.760,中国道路,,,
00:43:36.920,00:43:40.760,在世界上的微信影响力会更高,00:43:33.800,00:43:40.640,"China's path and model will gain higher
prestige and influence in the world,"
00:43:40.760,00:43:42.800,我的朋友会更多,00:43:40.960,00:43:42.960,and China will have more friends.
00:43:43.240,00:43:44.360,就跟我前面讲,,,
00:43:44.360,00:43:45.200,亚洲金融危机,,,
00:43:45.240,00:43:46.160,中国没有把,,,
00:43:46.200,00:43:46.760,自己货币,,,
00:43:46.800,00:43:47.640,点击,00:43:43.300,00:43:50.500,"Just like how China and Southeast Asian countries bonded
after our response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis,"
00:43:47.720,00:43:50.000,结果我们在东南亚的关系,,,
00:43:50.000,00:43:51.120,发展得非常快,,,
00:43:51.160,00:43:54.320,所以我觉得正确的义利观,00:43:50.500,00:43:53.720,this is the outlook on justice and benefits that we uphold.
00:43:54.360,00:43:54.720,对,,,
00:43:54.760,00:43:55.360,我们是,,,
00:43:55.400,00:43:55.880,负责任,00:43:54.400,00:43:56.400,We are responsible.
00:43:55.920,00:43:56.640,的,,,
00:43:56.680,00:43:58.320,这就是中国,,,
00:43:58.440,00:44:00.320,听张维维说,00:43:56.800,00:44:01.920,"China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:44:03.160,00:44:05.480,新官肺炎它是一个新生事物,00:44:03.200,00:44:07.420,COVID-19 is new and it takes time to understand it.
00:44:05.520,00:44:05.920,我们,,,
00:44:05.960,00:44:07.800,认识它需要一个过程,,,
00:44:08.280,00:44:10.280,我们现在认识了他,00:44:08.060,00:44:11.020,"Now that we have studied it and observed its development,"
00:44:10.280,00:44:11.840,研究了他观察他,,,
00:44:11.880,00:44:14.840,但最后我们要做到的是战胜它,00:44:11.260,00:44:14.220,we must finally defeat it!
00:44:14.960,00:44:17.160,关于有很多还可以总结,,,
00:44:17.360,00:44:18.800,因为这个情况还在持续,00:44:14.980,00:44:20.760,"As the epidemic evolves, our show
will continue to focus on this topic."
00:44:18.800,00:44:20.640,我们的节目也会持续来关注这个,,,
00:44:20.640,00:44:21.200,话题,,,
00:44:21.240,00:44:22.920,我们也非常感谢两位嘉宾,,,
