00:00:01.440,00:00:03.030,你看西方的民主也不太一样,00:00:01.080,00:00:03.080,Western democratic institutions are different.
00:00:03.031,00:00:06.270,美式民主和英式的和欧洲当时的国家其实都很形式,00:00:03.080,00:00:06.780,"Democratic institutions in the US, UK, and most European countries have taken different forms."
00:00:06.271,00:00:07.170,也不一样的,,,
00:00:07.171,00:00:08.790,就不管哪一种表现形式,,,
00:00:08.791,00:00:10.200,里面民族成份无过于,,,
00:00:10.201,00:00:15.360,就是把大家的免疫力能够更有效地反映到我们的政府执政的工作东西,00:00:07.160,00:00:15.620,"All forms, though, aim to effectively represent the people's will in the governance of their government."
00:00:15.361,00:00:16.770,我们网民老说,,,
00:00:16.771,00:00:19.080,在这个网络上是个泄愤的地方怎么样,00:00:15.780,00:00:18.805,"Chinese cyber citizens (""netizens"") has always described the Internet as a place for people to vent their anger."
00:00:19.081,00:00:22.500,可是你知不知道你所有的这些舆论啊,00:00:18.805,00:00:25.020,But are they aware that our government officials actually pay attention to all their comments?
00:00:22.501,00:00:23.430,我们的政府,,,
00:00:23.431,00:00:23.760,我们的,,,
00:00:23.761,00:00:24.540,负责的官员,,,
00:00:24.541,00:00:26.130,他会关注这个,00:00:25.520,00:00:28.760,"In contrast, the ""yellow vest"" movement in France"
00:00:26.131,00:00:31.770,而我们反观在法国这个黄马甲运动走到了今天至少是141516周的,00:00:28.760,00:00:31.720,"up till now, has already been ongoing for 16 weeks."
00:00:31.771,00:00:32.820,这种活动,,,
00:00:32.821,00:00:35.430,你会发现民众最抱怨的是我们说话,00:00:31.720,00:00:36.420,You will find what people complain most is that the government doesn't listen to the public.
00:00:35.431,00:00:41.280,他们不听政府就当看不见的英语有个词叫做放手就说一个政府,00:00:36.660,00:00:38.355,The government turns a blind eye to them.
00:00:41.281,00:00:42.660,不管是怎么形式,00:00:38.360,00:00:39.880,"There is a word called ""responsive""."
00:00:42.661,00:00:47.100,这个乡村政府他是不是对名字呼应民众的要求有呼应啊,00:00:39.880,00:00:45.420,"It is used to describe whether the government responds to people's needs,"
,,,00:00:45.560,00:00:47.120,regardless of the way it exercises its power.
00:00:47.101,00:00:49.500,他这个美国制度概念设计非常好说,00:00:47.300,00:00:49.300,The US election system is well designed.
00:00:49.501,00:00:50.370,哪个大学美,,,
00:00:50.371,00:00:51.840,每次四年大选一下,00:00:49.300,00:00:51.680,"For example, a president is elected every four years."
00:00:51.841,00:00:53.640,多少承诺是落实了的,00:00:51.680,00:00:54.580,"But how many promises, to what extent has the former one realized?"
00:00:53.641,00:00:55.020,落实到什么程度,,,
00:00:55.021,00:00:56.460,特朗普投票支持特朗普,00:00:54.760,00:00:56.860,"During the election campaigns,"
00:00:56.461,00:01:00.600,那个之前说是承诺要修美墨边境墙说一定要让墨西哥人掏钱,00:00:56.865,00:01:00.920,Trump promised to force Mexico pay for the to-be-built Mexico border wall.
00:01:00.601,00:01:03.570,现在还不是美国人自己掏钱,00:01:01.100,00:01:02.920,"But in reality, the Americans are the ones paying for it now."
00:01:03.571,00:01:09.990,倩倩首先是洞洞的国家紧急法案正式宣布紧急状态,00:01:03.240,00:01:08.640,"And he even declared a national emergency to build the wall, avoiding legal proceedings."
00:01:09.991,00:01:14.130,所以那种形式的民主制度更改路径,00:01:09.420,00:01:15.620,"So as Luojun mentioned, that kind of democracy is designed to be flowery."
00:01:14.131,00:01:15.840,制作设计很漂亮,,,
00:01:15.841,00:01:18.540,你可以尽情的发表你的观点,00:01:16.200,00:01:19.000,"In that democracy, you can express your views freely."
00:01:18.541,00:01:20.640,可是我有个厅的自由,00:01:19.000,00:01:21.000,"However, the government can choose to listen or not."
00:01:20.641,00:01:23.370,你会想象这样的情况在我们这里发什么,00:01:21.000,00:01:23.203,Can you imagine such things happening in China?
00:01:23.371,00:01:24.840,这是不可能,00:01:23.203,00:01:24.000,It is impossible.
00:01:24.841,00:01:26.910,如果明晚有这么强烈的批评的声音,00:01:24.160,00:01:26.273,"If people are criticizing the government strongly,"
00:01:26.911,00:01:29.310,我想相关的官员肯定很快就行动起来,00:01:26.273,00:01:29.020,our government will definitely deal with it in a very short time.
,,,00:01:29.220,00:01:29.780,Right.
00:01:29.311,00:01:31.530,是我觉得我卖个一两天就被骂了,00:01:29.860,00:01:32.220,"If you're too slow to respond even by a day or two, you will be badly scolded."
00:01:31.531,00:01:34.620,我觉得他这个之所以会回应的快,00:01:32.380,00:01:35.320,The key reason why our government responds quickly is that
00:01:34.621,00:01:36.840,关键的出发点还是他很在意,,,
00:01:36.841,00:01:38.130,在他在意你,00:01:35.500,00:01:38.200,they really cares about its people's opinions.
00:01:38.131,00:01:40.530,你也得看刚才大家举了美国的例子,00:01:38.320,00:01:41.660,"Just now, you took the example of the US, France and maybe other countries."
00:01:40.531,00:01:41.250,举了法国看看,,,
00:01:41.251,00:01:46.050,还有其他国家就是我们通常可能以往啊,00:01:41.860,00:01:47.260,"Usually, we may simply just say this is a good system."
00:01:46.051,00:01:48.030,大家会哎还是这个号,,,
00:01:48.031,00:01:48.480,然后呢,,,
00:01:48.481,00:01:49.740,我们就忘了去观察,00:01:47.400,00:01:49.860,"But in actuality, we forget to look closely at the system."
00:01:49.741,00:01:52.200,其实他在具体的运作当中,,,
00:01:52.201,00:01:56.250,它本身碰到的这种障碍产生了这种状况,00:01:50.000,00:01:55.720,There are barriers to the implementation and may cause further problems.
00:01:56.251,00:01:59.610,但其实我们是要静下心来去看的那几张老师,00:01:56.080,00:01:58.520,We should reflect on the system carefully.
00:01:59.611,00:02:01.470,我们中国的民主的实现,00:01:58.520,00:02:01.980,"In this episode, Prof.Zhang will answer the question of how to practice democracy in China?"
00:02:01.471,00:02:04.020,其实这不是我们中国人自己的命题,00:02:01.980,00:02:04.945,"Actually, this is not a question only for China, but for the whole world."
00:02:04.021,00:02:07.980,我现在是全世界都在关注他们也要民主要民主,00:02:04.945,00:02:07.745,"We want democracy, and they also want that."
00:02:07.981,00:02:09.480,那么中国人就是这样的事情,00:02:07.745,00:02:10.460,How did China carry out democracy?
00:02:09.481,00:02:14.100,当时我二月份曾经看到在这个网站上有这么一条消息,00:02:10.660,00:02:13.500,"In February, I read an article on a website."
00:02:14.101,00:02:16.350,这是德国的这个经济周刊啊,,,
00:02:16.351,00:02:17.250,别舍不得包子,00:02:13.500,00:02:20.660,"It is written by an editor of Wirtschaftswoche, a German weekly business news magazine."
00:02:17.251,00:02:19.110,他有一个专门的一个,,,
00:02:19.111,00:02:20.790,这个主编写了一篇文档,,,
00:02:20.791,00:02:21.330,他在里面,00:02:20.840,00:02:21.840,He wrote in the article that
00:02:21.331,00:02:22.380,至于有这么一段话,,,
00:02:22.381,00:02:23.190,他说,,,
00:02:23.191,00:02:26.190,现在德国普通人只有40%,00:02:22.020,00:02:28.260,"only 40% of Germany trusted their government,"
00:02:26.191,00:02:28.620,还对本国政府抱有信任啊,,,
00:02:28.621,00:02:32.280,但是这个比例在中国的高达86%,00:02:28.440,00:02:31.880,"but in China, the percentage of it reached 86%."
00:02:32.281,00:02:32.850,他说,00:02:32.020,00:02:35.600,"After knowing such a gap, he had this question,"
00:02:32.851,00:02:39.720,这样的这个调查让人不禁问道说西方的代议制民主是不是要迎来爽啊,00:02:35.760,00:02:39.140,is Western representative democracy dying?
00:02:39.721,00:02:40.050,他说,,,
00:02:40.051,00:02:43.140,这个在与中国政府的体制竞赛之中,00:02:39.420,00:02:43.300,"When competing with China's model of governance,"
00:02:43.141,00:02:45.270,西方体制如何兑现,,,
00:02:45.271,00:02:48.480,他们对民众富足生活的承诺,00:02:43.600,00:02:48.940,how can western countries carry out their promise to a prosperous life for the people?
00:02:48.481,00:02:51.510,这是一个德国非常有分量的经济媒体来说,00:02:49.080,00:02:52.280,That's from an influential German economic media.
00:02:51.511,00:02:52.380,这个身为中国人,,,
00:02:52.381,00:02:54.870,就是要保持一个要独立思考的能力,00:02:52.360,00:02:54.320,Chinese people should maintain their ability to think independently.
00:02:54.871,00:02:57.060,接受民众的不是到了一个完美答案了,00:02:54.520,00:02:58.880,We shouldn't regard democracy as the perfect answer and just copy it.
00:02:57.061,00:02:58.590,我们这样去拷贝答案就行了,,,
00:02:58.591,00:03:01.890,觉得他真是一个世界面临的一个这个东西,00:02:58.880,00:03:01.840,How to develop a democracy is a worldwide problem.

00:03:01.891,00:03:02.040,哈,,,
00:03:08.520,00:03:10.560,大家好欢迎来到这就是中国,00:03:08.560,00:03:10.880,Hello everyone. Welcome to China Now.
00:03:10.561,00:03:12.420,让我们一起在这里定位中国,,,
00:03:12.421,00:03:14.640,理解中国读懂中国,00:03:11.040,00:03:14.740,"We are here to learn about China, understand China,
and position China!"
00:03:14.641,00:03:16.410,我身边的是我们节目的主嘉宾,00:03:14.920,00:03:17.160,"Standing next to me is our keynote speaker,"
00:03:16.411,00:03:19.530,来自复旦大学中国研究院的院长张维为教授,00:03:17.160,00:03:20.175,"Professor Zhang Weiwei, Director of China Institute of Fudan University."
00:03:19.531,00:03:22.410,在现场还有我们的观众朋友给我们的评论员小组,00:03:20.175,00:03:23.125,"There are many people in the audience today, including our pre-production panel."
00:03:22.411,00:03:25.290,我们将会一起来现场听张教授的演讲,00:03:23.125,00:03:26.460,We will listen to the speech by Prof. Zhang and brainstorm together.
00:03:25.291,00:03:27.360,同时展开头脑风暴,,,
00:03:27.361,00:03:28.410,那么在上一集呢,,,
00:03:28.411,00:03:31.050,我们讨论了关于民主这个话题,00:03:26.540,00:03:30.940,"In the last episode, we discussed democracy."
00:03:31.051,00:03:33.900,而关于民主张教授依然有话要说,00:03:31.080,00:03:34.660,"And about democracy, Prof.Zhang still has something to say."
00:03:33.901,00:03:35.310,接下来我们把时间交给你,00:03:34.760,00:03:35.260,I will give you the floor.
,,,00:03:35.260,00:03:36.480,Thank you.
00:03:41.010,00:03:41.880,那么,00:03:40.880,00:03:43.520,We surf the Internet frequently.
00:03:41.881,00:03:46.590,大家这个金刚上网可能知道网上有一种观点,00:03:43.520,00:03:48.320,"We may know some netizens never compare China with democracies that ""are worse off""."
00:03:46.591,00:03:47.880,叫做不要抵赖,,,
00:03:49.260,00:03:51.450,那就按你说的这个伊拉克高的民族,00:03:48.540,00:03:52.200,"For example, if you say Iraq and Afghanistan are democracies,"
00:03:51.451,00:03:52.560,它散发的名字,,,
00:03:52.561,00:03:54.390,结果一个比一个糟,00:03:52.380,00:03:54.520,but their democracy has been one worse than the other.
00:03:54.391,00:03:54.690,他说,,,
00:03:54.691,00:03:56.850,你们为什么要跟这些国家的要抵赖,00:03:54.600,00:03:58.080,"People may ask, why do you compare China with these democracies that ""are worse off""?"
00:03:57.930,00:04:01.050,你说印度搞了民主发展的很不顺利,00:03:58.120,00:04:00.960,"If you say another democracy India, is not developing well,"
00:04:01.051,00:04:04.620,他为什么跟印度比那不能跟美国比对不对,00:04:00.960,00:04:02.880,"they may ask, why do you compare China with India?"
,,,00:04:03.000,00:04:05.040,Why don't you compare China with the US?
00:04:04.621,00:04:07.110,但你说美国过去40年,00:04:05.040,00:04:06.125,And then if you point out that
00:04:07.111,00:04:09.750,多数人的收入几乎没有增长,00:04:06.125,00:04:11.160,"in the past 40 years, democracy in the US failed to increase the income of the majority of Americans and has instead led to populism."
00:04:09.751,00:04:11.550,而且导致了民粹主义,,,
00:04:11.551,00:04:11.790,他说,,,
00:04:11.791,00:04:12.840,你不要比烂吗,00:04:11.320,00:04:14.080,"They may ask, why do you always compare China with democracies that ""are worse off""?"
00:04:12.841,00:04:14.520,你为什么不和北欧比呢,,,
00:04:14.521,00:04:15.810,对不对,00:04:14.080,00:04:15.840,Why don't you compare it with Northern European countries?
00:04:15.811,00:04:17.130,实际上这个有机会,00:04:16.020,00:04:18.020,"Actually, if I get the opportunity, I also would like to talk about Northern European countries."
00:04:17.131,00:04:21.990,我也想这个聊一聊北欧也是可以进行比较,00:04:18.020,00:04:21.400,They are comparable.
00:04:21.991,00:04:27.900,那么这种讲不要比那年暑假他有一种心态不是很好,00:04:21.700,00:04:27.620,"Those who say not to compare China with countries that ""are worse off"" actually have a bad mindset."
00:04:27.901,00:04:34.530,他容不得别人说中国好容不得别人说中国进步快,00:04:27.840,00:04:34.040,They can't tolerate when people say China is doing good or that China is developing really fast.
00:04:34.531,00:04:40.770,那么精神往往就是对西方世界还是有一种无比的憧憬,00:04:34.320,00:04:40.360,"Generally, these people still have a longing for the western system."
00:04:40.771,00:04:43.530,他们觉得就是只要中国的做法,00:04:40.520,00:04:45.820,"They think, as long as China's system and ways of doing things are different from the west's,"
00:04:43.531,00:04:46.410,中国的制度和西方不一样啊,,,
00:04:46.411,00:04:48.150,肯定是中国不对,00:04:46.000,00:04:47.900,then China must be the one in the wrong way.
00:04:48.151,00:04:49.050,坦率的讲,,,
00:04:49.051,00:04:51.780,就是柜子时间长了,00:04:48.080,00:04:54.120,"To put it straight, they are accustomed to kneeling to the west and can no longer stand up with confidence."
00:04:51.781,00:04:53.400,养成习惯了站不起来,,,
00:04:54.480,00:04:54.930,其实,,,
00:04:54.931,00:04:57.600,这个所谓比烂了这个始作俑者,00:04:54.340,00:05:00.740,"The concept of comparing ""who's worse"" originated from the west, not China."
00:04:57.601,00:04:58.410,不是中国人,,,
00:04:58.411,00:05:01.020,不是我是西方人,,,
00:05:01.021,00:05:02.340,我大致查了一下,,,
00:05:02.341,00:05:04.290,只要是英国首相丘吉尔,00:05:00.920,00:05:06.580,I did some research and found it was a saying from the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill:
00:05:05.370,00:05:07.350,他讲过那句名言,,,
00:05:07.351,00:05:09.930,就是民主制度使然不好,,,
00:05:09.931,00:05:10.800,但是呢,00:05:07.060,00:05:14.360,"""It has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."""
00:05:10.801,00:05:14.760,其他制度还不如民警更不好,,,
00:05:14.761,00:05:15.360,所以呢,,,
00:05:15.361,00:05:18.300,叫做最不坏的制度,00:05:14.540,00:05:17.995,So democracy is the least bad of them all.
00:05:18.301,00:05:19.350,那我当然他讲的话,,,
00:05:19.351,00:05:21.900,像是在西方的这个与境内,00:05:18.000,00:05:21.360,"Well, of course, what he said was in the Western context."
00:05:21.901,00:05:26.460,它实际上是当时支持对印度继续知名的,00:05:21.360,00:05:25.700,He supported to continue the colonization in India.
00:05:26.461,00:05:27.960,没想到印度也要搞名堂,00:05:25.700,00:05:28.420,He didn't know India would be a democracy.
00:05:27.961,00:05:28.590,觉得不可能,00:05:28.540,00:05:29.800,He thought it was impossible.
00:05:30.030,00:05:32.820,所以我觉得是彼岸的最早的版本,00:05:29.920,00:05:33.080,"So I think this is the earliest comparison of ""who's worse""."
00:05:32.821,00:05:36.630,所以如果人家下次再问俺标题,00:05:33.340,00:05:36.940,"If someone asks you not to make such comparisons next time,"
00:05:36.631,00:05:38.610,兰州进士邱家发明的,00:05:37.060,00:05:39.400,you should tell him that this originated from Churchill.
00:05:39.750,00:05:43.320,那么我就求教这个迷你,00:05:39.680,00:05:45.780,"I think that this famous saying of Churchill actually misled many people,"
00:05:43.321,00:05:45.480,实际上误导了很多人,,,
00:05:45.481,00:05:47.490,导致现在还有一些国家,00:05:45.780,00:05:49.120,causing some countries to stagnate.
00:05:47.491,00:05:49.530,一些人就是不思进取,,,
00:05:49.531,00:05:52.950,让他自己的民主制度已经产生大量的问题,00:05:49.440,00:05:52.360,"In fact, the Western democratic system has  a lot of problems,"
00:05:52.951,00:05:54.420,但还是觉得心安理得,00:05:52.680,00:05:55.560,"but they still don't think it a problem,"
00:05:54.421,00:05:57.120,反正其他制度都不我好,00:05:55.560,00:05:57.600,since the other systems are not as good as a democracy.
00:05:58.320,00:05:58.710,那么,,,
00:05:58.711,00:06:03.510,我自己老蒋的西方国家过去之间老是忽悠别人,00:05:58.080,00:06:03.080,I always said that Western countries have been fooling others in recent years.
00:06:03.511,00:06:05.010,说你们一定要招待我们的错,00:06:03.380,00:06:06.380,"They asked other countries to copy their system, believing it is the best in the world,"
00:06:05.011,00:06:11.310,我们这个世界最好历史终结论结果真的可能是就是忽悠别人忽悠的太多了,00:06:06.560,00:06:08.320,"which is depicted in the book ""The End of History""."
00:06:11.311,00:06:14.490,自己真的性质的东西正因为他们是最好的制度,00:06:08.500,00:06:13.920,"They have fooled others and themselves into thinking that their system is the best,"
00:06:14.491,00:06:17.250,就自己制度出来出现越来越多的问题,00:06:14.240,00:06:17.120,but more and more problems have emerged within their systems.
00:06:18.570,00:06:23.430,那么生殖我叫做变成一种坏名声烂民族,00:06:18.720,00:06:23.240,I would even say it becomes a bad democracy.
00:06:23.431,00:06:26.040,你们这就涉及到我今天想讲一个话题,00:06:23.500,00:06:26.080,This is the first topic of today.
00:06:26.041,00:06:29.010,我叫郝民族才是好东西,,,
00:06:29.011,00:06:30.960,烂民主只能是坏东西,00:06:26.320,00:06:32.920,"A good democracy is good, but bad democracy can only be bad."
00:06:30.961,00:06:33.600,会教坏民族只能坏东西,00:06:33.440,00:06:36.400,"I have traveled to many countries,"
00:06:33.601,00:06:39.000,那我走过的国家多走过的地方多对西方民主忽悠啊,00:06:36.620,00:06:40.622,"and I have seen the adversity, difficulties, dilemmas, and disasters"
00:06:39.001,00:06:43.020,给其他国家带来的逆境困难困境,00:06:40.622,00:06:43.800,brought about by Western democracy to other countries.
00:06:43.021,00:06:45.420,灾难感同身受,00:06:43.980,00:06:45.420,I can empathize.
00:06:45.421,00:06:48.030,所以我的这个结论就很简单,00:06:45.420,00:06:48.300,So my conclusion is very simple.
00:06:48.031,00:06:49.530,如果不要谈民主的话,00:06:48.300,00:06:49.720,"If we want to talk about democracy,"
00:06:49.531,00:06:51.000,一定要做一个区分,,,
00:06:51.001,00:06:52.140,什么是好名字,00:06:49.760,00:06:54.060,we must make a distinction between good democracy and bad democracy.
00:06:52.141,00:06:53.160,什么是烂民族,,,
00:06:53.161,00:06:54.270,什么是坏民主,,,
00:06:54.271,00:06:55.350,否则要出大问题,00:06:54.140,00:06:56.120,"Otherwise, there will be big problems."
00:06:56.610,00:06:58.830,那么早在2006年时候,00:06:56.360,00:06:59.400,"As early as in 2006, I pubilshed an article, ""The Allure of Chinese Model,"""
00:06:58.831,00:07:04.080,我当时给这个纽约时报的国际版汐或篇文章谈中国模式,00:06:59.580,00:07:03.520,on the international edition of The New York Times
00:07:04.081,00:07:05.550,同时我当时就批评了,,,
00:07:05.551,00:07:10.620,就是西方国家大力的输出西方那种民主模式,00:07:03.660,00:07:09.420,"I criticized the Western countries for straining to export their democracy model,"
00:07:10.621,00:07:14.640,然后我说甚至不惜发动战争来这样做我,00:07:09.600,00:07:14.580,and even waging wars to achieve it.
00:07:14.641,00:07:19.140,当时我这样写的西方强行输出自己的民主模式,00:07:14.680,00:07:18.074,"I wrote the West imposed its democracy model,"
00:07:19.141,00:07:22.200,给发展中国家带来大量的问题,00:07:18.074,00:07:21.920,bringing a lot of problems to developing countries.
,,,00:07:21.960,00:07:23.840,"""The American model is largely ideology driven,"
00:07:22.201,00:07:25.830,西方意识形态挂帅推行大规模的,00:07:23.940,00:07:27.780,with a focus on mass democratization.
00:07:25.831,00:07:30.390,激进的民主化不是一个地方的具体情况,00:07:27.780,00:07:30.460,"With little regard to local conditions,"
00:07:30.391,00:07:34.200,把非洲和许多不甚发达的地方看清,00:07:30.460,00:07:34.340,it treats sub-Saharan Africa or other less developed countries as mature societies
00:07:34.201,00:07:38.250,西方体制可以自然生长的存储社会,00:07:34.620,00:07:38.460,in which Western institutions will automatically take root.
00:07:38.251,00:07:43.830,在宽容的政治文化和法治社会形成之前就推行所谓民主化,00:07:38.740,00:07:43.600,It imposed democratization before a culture of political tolerance and the rule of law was established.
00:07:43.831,00:07:45.300,结果是令人沮丧,00:07:43.760,00:07:46.540,"The end result has often been discouraging or even devastating."""
00:07:45.301,00:07:46.320,甚至灾难性,,,
00:07:47.220,00:07:48.240,我当时也用了,,,
00:07:48.241,00:07:51.180,就是两位美国学者的研究,,,
00:07:51.181,00:07:55.950,一个叫爱德华漫水漫刺耳的一个叫杰克,00:07:46.960,00:07:56.820,"I quoted the research of two American scholars, Edward Mansfield and Jack Snyder."
00:07:55.951,00:07:58.380,是耐着他们写了一本专著的书名,,,
00:07:58.381,00:08:02.430,就会引起叫做是从选举到厮杀,00:07:57.020,00:08:00.500,"They wrote a monograph, the title of which is very interesting,"
00:08:02.431,00:08:05.580,为什么新兴民主国家走向战争,00:08:00.700,00:08:05.480,"""Electing to Fight: Why Emerging Democracies Go to War""."
00:08:06.630,00:08:08.460,他们举了大量的案例,00:08:06.020,00:08:09.140,They gave a large number of examples.
00:08:08.461,00:08:09.900,整个九十年代,,,
00:08:09.901,00:08:13.020,所谓这个搞了民主化自由选举之后,00:08:09.240,00:08:12.400,"After the so-called democratized and free elections in the 1990s,"
00:08:13.021,00:08:15.720,这些国家立马进入战争状态,00:08:12.740,00:08:15.745,those countries immediately entered a state of war.
,,,00:08:15.745,00:08:17.960,"Armenia's war against Azerbaijan,"
00:08:15.721,00:08:20.670,亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆派头厄瓜多尔和秘鲁开头,00:08:18.100,00:08:20.980,"Ecuador against Peru,"
,,,00:08:21.160,00:08:24.040,"Ethiopia against Eritrea,"
00:08:20.671,00:08:29.070,埃塞俄比亚和厄立特里亚开展布隆迪和卢旺达内部开始大屠杀一百多万人丧生,00:08:24.300,00:08:28.380,"and massacres broke in Burundi and Rwanda,
 killing more than one million people."
00:08:29.071,00:08:32.940,那么后来阿拉伯之春变阿拉伯之冬也是这样的,00:08:28.560,00:08:32.500,It is the same as how the Arab Spring turned into the Arab Winter.
00:08:32.941,00:08:34.170,2003年,,,
00:08:34.171,00:08:36.480,小布什发动伊拉克战争,00:08:32.600,00:08:36.640,"In 2003, George W. Bush launched the Iraq War"
00:08:36.481,00:08:41.100,当然他推出了一个叫做阿拉伯民族改造的机会,00:08:36.640,00:08:40.280,and a plan to push Arab democracy reform.
00:08:41.101,00:08:41.400,他说,,,
00:08:41.401,00:08:46.590,恐怖主义的根源是因为阿拉伯国家没有成为民主国家,00:08:40.760,00:08:46.080,He said the roots of terrorism lie in the non-democracy of Arab countries.
00:08:46.591,00:08:47.910,但到了2006年,,,
00:08:47.911,00:08:49.800,他把这个计划暂时搁置,00:08:46.280,00:08:50.500,"But in 2006, he put this plan aside. Why?"
00:08:49.801,00:08:56.130,为什么因为那一年的巴勒斯坦一人一票选出了叫哈马斯政权,00:08:50.680,00:08:53.540,"Because in that year, following the rule of One Person One Vote,"
00:08:56.131,00:08:59.100,这哈马斯政权在美国人眼里是个恐怖主义组织,00:08:53.880,00:08:58.880,"Palestine elected Hamas, a terrorist organization in the eyes of Americans."
00:09:00.270,00:09:02.250,但是到2011年前,,,
00:09:02.251,00:09:05.190,就中东出现各种乱象的时候,00:09:00.000,00:09:05.000,"But around 2011, when the Middle East was in chaos,"
00:09:05.191,00:09:07.890,美国又开始推动这个中东地区首位,00:09:05.000,00:09:10.320,"the United States began to promote the so-called second wave of democratization in the Middle East, the Arab Spring."
00:09:07.891,00:09:10.920,第二波民主化也就是阿拉伯之春,,,
00:09:10.921,00:09:13.380,当时西方世界一片欢呼声,00:09:10.625,00:09:13.375,The whole West was cheering for it.
00:09:13.381,00:09:17.100,伟大的西方民主模式终于降临到了阿拉伯世界,00:09:13.375,00:09:16.565,The great western democracy finally arrived at the Arab.
00:09:17.101,00:09:17.790,当然,,,
00:09:17.791,00:09:18.600,后来这个结局,00:09:16.805,00:09:19.455,"Later, we saw the result,"
00:09:18.601,00:09:22.350,我们看到了阿拉伯之春变成阿拉伯之冬,00:09:19.460,00:09:21.960,the Arab Spring turned into the Arab Winter.
00:09:22.351,00:09:24.510,上百万甚至更多的男人,,,
00:09:24.511,00:09:26.790,要么你进入了欧洲,00:09:22.120,00:09:28.800,"Millions of refugees have entered Europe or have been preparing to go to Europe,"
00:09:26.791,00:09:29.460,要么时刻准备只留下欧洲,,,
00:09:29.461,00:09:32.670,这成了欧洲经典最头疼的政治难题,00:09:29.240,00:09:35.960,"which has become the most difficult political problem in Europe, messing up European politics."
00:09:32.671,00:09:36.210,把欧洲政坛搞得乱成一锅粥,,,
00:09:36.211,00:09:36.750,其实啊,,,
00:09:36.751,00:09:46.590,这个西方强行在非西方世界推行西方这种运作模式是一种我叫做民主原教旨主义,00:09:36.080,00:09:42.559,"Indeed the West imposing western democracy on other regions represents a belief,"
,,,00:09:42.559,00:09:45.960,"the one I call ""democracy fundamentalism"","
00:09:46.591,00:09:48.930,给这个世界带来太多的问题,00:09:46.240,00:09:50.040,which has brought too many problems and disasters to the world.
00:09:48.931,00:09:50.550,太多的灾难,,,
00:09:50.551,00:09:53.820,那么去年和德国智库与一个交流额,00:09:50.220,00:09:53.440,I went to a German think tank for an academic exchange last year.
00:09:53.821,00:09:59.250,我这么花些时间了解一下这个中东难民问题的规定,00:09:53.600,00:09:58.319,I spent some time on the population of refugees from the Middle East
00:09:59.251,00:10:02.550,但对欧洲对德国会产生不利影响,00:09:58.319,00:10:01.580,and the negative impacts on Europe and Germany.
00:10:02.551,00:10:03.150,他们说,,,
00:10:03.151,00:10:04.680,他们的估计就在现在,00:10:02.260,00:10:05.200,"They estimated that,"
00:10:04.681,00:10:12.660,土耳其至少有三百万来自中东地区的男人等着听说梧州难民问题,00:10:05.200,00:10:12.100,at least 3 million refugees from the Middle East were waiting to enter Europe in Turkey.
00:10:12.661,00:10:16.620,一些德国人所学者所思成了土耳其政府的人质,00:10:12.280,00:10:16.460,Some German scholars described them as the hostages of the Turkish government.
00:10:16.621,00:10:19.920,动不动就有难民问题向德国要钱,00:10:16.600,00:10:19.720,Turkey often asked for money from Germany with the refugees.
00:10:19.921,00:10:21.150,当时德国的一家之言,00:10:19.840,00:10:21.720,"Well, this is one side of the story from Germany."
00:10:22.230,00:10:26.160,那么整个北非至少还有三百万呢,00:10:21.980,00:10:26.600,"In addition, at least 3 million refugees are waiting throughout North Africa."
00:10:26.161,00:10:30.210,等着其中光是利比亚就不少于一百万,00:10:26.900,00:10:29.340,"In Libya alone, there were no less than 1 million."
00:10:30.211,00:10:32.160,也是随时准备迎战欧洲,00:10:29.460,00:10:33.080,They are also ready to flock to Europe at any time.
00:10:33.390,00:10:35.010,那么坦率的说,,,
00:10:35.011,00:10:37.590,这个德国总理默克尔,,,
00:10:37.591,00:10:39.570,他最初的设想是,00:10:33.160,00:10:42.220,"To be frank, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel's initial planned to take the lead in accepting refugees"
00:10:39.571,00:10:43.050,我这个德国先带走接受难民,,,
00:10:43.051,00:10:46.350,反正德国的经济需要一些这个便宜的劳动力,00:10:42.600,00:10:46.740,because Germany needed cheap labor after all.
00:10:47.280,00:10:47.580,然后,,,
00:10:47.581,00:10:51.960,他就以人权人道主义的名义欢迎来自中东的难民,00:10:47.000,00:10:52.560,So she welcomed refugees from the Middle East in the name of human rights and humanity.
00:10:53.190,00:10:55.740,他当时确实是可能有点天真了,00:10:52.760,00:10:55.755,She was indeed a bit naive.
00:10:55.741,00:11:00.030,他估计其他欧盟成员也会跟上向他学习啊,00:10:55.760,00:11:00.360,She assumed that other EU members would follow her steps.
00:11:00.031,00:11:03.930,没想到结果其他欧盟成员忘了普世价值,00:11:00.560,00:11:03.160,"Unexpectedly, other EU members forgot the universal value and"
00:11:03.931,00:11:06.420,这个把难民送到德国大门口,00:11:03.645,00:11:06.465,and sent the refugees to German's gate.
00:11:06.421,00:11:08.580,最好你全部接手弄的,00:11:06.465,00:11:09.135,It was such a good deal if German would accept them all.
00:11:08.581,00:11:12.600,这个得过阵子一下子陷入这种窘境,00:11:09.135,00:11:12.285,"Eventually, German politics suddenly fell into a dilemma."
00:11:12.601,00:11:16.320,然后弄的默克尔在德国的威望一路下滑,00:11:12.300,00:11:15.980,Merkel also gradually lost some of her prestige.
00:11:16.321,00:11:18.660,现在也准备退出政治舞台,00:11:16.120,00:11:19.060,And she is preparing to withdraw from the political arena.
00:11:19.590,00:11:21.690,其实是欧洲人自己啊,,,
00:11:21.691,00:11:24.060,我叫搬起石头砸自己的脚,00:11:19.320,00:11:24.500,"In fact, the Europeans reap what they sowed."
00:11:24.061,00:11:28.470,当初你们为什么要这么大力的支持阿拉伯之春,00:11:24.880,00:11:27.860,Why did you support the Arab Spring so strongly?
,,,00:11:27.860,00:11:30.380,"If they had seen the end, would they do the same?"
00:11:28.471,00:11:36.210,这早知今日何必当初实际上关于民族的化解西方很多有头脑的思想,00:11:30.660,00:11:38.980,"On the topic of democracy, many great thinkers in the West also had many thoughts."
00:11:37.440,00:11:39.660,也做了很多的思考,,,
00:11:39.661,00:11:42.930,那我可以跟大家分享一些,00:11:39.320,00:11:41.920,I would share some of their thoughts with you.
00:11:42.931,00:11:43.560,在思考,,,
00:11:43.561,00:11:45.480,我觉得我们今天认识民主,00:11:42.460,00:11:47.700,I think their thoughts can help us understand and build democracy better.
00:11:45.481,00:11:48.720,建设民生尚都是有价值的,,,
00:11:48.721,00:11:52.350,那么大家知道我们谈民主一般都要追溯到古希腊,00:11:48.400,00:11:50.280,"When it comes to democracy,"
00:11:52.351,00:11:56.100,因为那是公认的西方民主的发源地,00:11:50.280,00:11:55.040,"we usually date back to ancient Greece, the birthplace of Western democracy."
00:11:56.101,00:11:58.740,那么的这种原始的民主状态,00:11:55.780,00:11:58.200,It was a primitive democracy.
00:11:58.741,00:12:01.470,古希腊有很多所谓的城邦啊,00:11:58.480,00:12:02.960,"In ancient Greece, there were many so-called city-states in different sizes."
00:12:01.471,00:12:03.600,大大小小不少,,,
00:12:03.601,00:12:05.010,我们规模大概等于中国,,,
00:12:05.011,00:12:08.010,今年春和镇马论人口,00:12:03.420,00:12:07.620,Their population was roughly the same as those of the villages or towns in China today.
,,,00:12:07.760,00:12:10.840,"In those so-called city-states,"
00:12:08.011,00:12:13.980,那么在那些这个所谓城邦里面的这个男性的功能不包括妇女,00:12:11.000,00:12:12.820,"citizens, excluding women and slaves,"
00:12:13.981,00:12:17.160,不包括占人口多数的奴隶,00:12:13.120,00:12:15.660,"who were the majority of the population,"
00:12:17.161,00:12:22.620,可以通过一些公民会议来决定是否要对外宣战,00:12:16.000,00:12:24.320,"could decide whether to fight with other city-states in the ecclesia,"
00:12:22.621,00:12:27.030,是不是要对外购和是否这个法庭对碳什么样的情那么大,00:12:24.320,00:12:26.480,and how to punish criminals.
00:12:27.031,00:12:30.810,可能知道就古希腊有一个大哲学家叫苏格拉底,00:12:26.820,00:12:30.260,You may have known a great philosopher named Socrates in Athens.
00:12:30.811,00:12:34.170,他当时有一个罪名叫做腐蚀青年的思想,00:12:30.545,00:12:33.725,"He was charged with corrupting the youth’s ideology,"
00:12:34.171,00:12:37.590,结果他被一人一票的民主制度判了死刑,00:12:33.860,00:12:38.180,"and was sentenced to death by the democracy of “one person, one vote”."
00:12:38.580,00:12:43.680,所以他的学生古希腊的另外一位大哲学家柏拉图对此耿耿于怀,00:12:38.240,00:12:42.249,"Therefore, his student, Plato, another great philosopher in ancient Greece,"
00:12:43.681,00:12:44.850,愤愤不平,00:12:42.249,00:12:44.440,was bitter and indignant about his death.
00:12:44.851,00:12:45.540,他认为,,,
00:12:45.541,00:12:50.580,这个民族的玉石报名通知英文叫做冒泡了,00:12:44.600,00:12:49.440,"He believed that democracy was actually mob politics,"
00:12:50.581,00:12:53.910,真是柏拉图觉得人的智力也好,,,
00:12:53.911,00:12:54.840,品行也好,00:12:51.700,00:12:56.720,"because men were different from each other in intelligence, morality, and ability."
00:12:54.841,00:12:55.740,能力也好,,,
00:12:55.741,00:12:57.360,性差异,,,
00:12:57.361,00:12:59.550,但在古下这种民主条件下,00:12:57.060,00:13:02.615,"However, in the democratic institution of Athens, the differences were ignored."
00:12:59.551,00:13:02.820,民主制度下否认这种差异预设,00:13:02.620,00:13:04.601,"In such an institution, it was assumed that"
00:13:02.821,00:13:07.410,所以的男性公民都应该享有同样的政治权力,00:13:04.601,00:13:07.180,"all male citizens should have the same political rights,"
00:13:07.411,00:13:10.530,那么结果必然导致他亲自为报名征集,00:13:07.340,00:13:10.740,so the result will inevitably lead to mob politics.
00:13:11.520,00:13:12.870,他当然讲了一个故事,00:13:11.220,00:13:13.040,He told a story.
00:13:12.871,00:13:13.650,他说,,,
00:13:13.651,00:13:14.940,如果你生病了,00:13:13.280,00:13:14.980,"If you were ill,"
00:13:14.941,00:13:17.100,你是找一个经过良好训练,,,
00:13:17.101,00:13:18.090,有资质的,,,
00:13:18.091,00:13:20.490,有大量的实践经验的,00:13:15.120,00:13:21.180,"would you go to see a well-trained, qualified and experienced doctor"
00:13:20.491,00:13:21.870,这个大夫呢,,,
00:13:21.871,00:13:27.360,还到广场上让毫无医学知识的人随便给你选一个人帮你治病,00:13:21.600,00:13:26.800,or ask someone without medical knowledge for treatment on a city square?
00:13:27.361,00:13:27.690,他说,,,
00:13:27.691,00:13:29.790,当然要找专业大夫,00:13:27.060,00:13:28.940,"He said, of course, you would choose a professional doctor."
00:13:29.791,00:13:32.070,而智利国家这样的事情,00:13:29.475,00:13:32.455,"And for a country,"
00:13:32.071,00:13:32.850,他的责任,,,
00:13:32.851,00:13:35.580,他的难度可能百倍于一个大夫,00:13:32.455,00:13:35.165,the governor's responsibility and difficulty would be a hundred times more than a doctor's.
00:13:35.581,00:13:36.300,你该找谁,00:13:35.460,00:13:37.020,Whom would you rely on?
00:13:37.830,00:13:38.370,毫无疑问,,,
00:13:38.371,00:13:39.390,应该找有经验,,,
00:13:39.391,00:13:41.880,有资质治国人才,00:13:37.380,00:13:41.500,There is no doubt that we should find an experienced and qualified person with governing capacity.
00:13:41.881,00:13:46.740,我想这个柏拉图上他的这个观念和我们中国人讲的比较一致,00:13:41.680,00:13:47.040,I think that Plato's idea is similar to China’s.
00:13:46.741,00:13:48.600,就是治国要靠人才,00:13:47.220,00:13:48.300,Governing a country needs talents.
00:13:48.601,00:13:49.770,人才要有力量,00:13:48.520,00:13:50.980,Talents must be tempered and qualified.
00:13:49.771,00:13:51.180,要有资质,,,
00:13:51.181,00:13:56.490,那么西方把本来应该是这个操作很精致的,,,
00:13:56.491,00:14:02.460,要有何丰富的这个文化积淀的内容也更加丰富的一种,00:13:51.120,00:14:02.320,"The ideal democracy should be very sophisticated and rich in culture and content,"
00:14:02.461,00:14:03.630,比较理想的名字,,,
00:14:03.631,00:14:06.840,把他大大地简化什么国情,00:14:02.460,00:14:05.660,"but the West over-simplified democracy,"
00:14:06.841,00:14:07.560,什么文化,,,
00:14:07.561,00:14:08.130,什么传统,,,
00:14:08.131,00:14:08.580,什么教育,00:14:05.760,00:14:11.000,"ignoring all important things--national condition, culture, tradition, education, and the rule of law."
00:14:08.581,00:14:10.620,随便什么法治水平通通不重要,,,
00:14:10.621,00:14:13.740,只要有多档加一元一票就是民主结果,00:14:11.000,00:14:13.535,"They think a country that has a multi-party system and the rule of one person one vote, is a democracy."
00:14:13.741,00:14:22.290,导致了世界上一大批的借助各种各样的这个劣质民族难民组多少国家一失足成千古恨,00:14:13.540,00:14:20.080,"As a result, so many bad democracies were born in the world."
,,,00:14:20.320,00:14:22.275,Far too many countries have made this mistake
00:14:22.291,00:14:25.290,陷于长期的动乱乃至战乱,00:14:22.280,00:14:25.580,"and suffered long-term turmoil, wars and economic recessions."
00:14:25.291,00:14:26.100,经济凋敝,,,
00:14:26.101,00:14:27.690,民不聊生,00:14:25.760,00:14:27.180,Their people are living in misery.
00:14:27.691,00:14:28.020,那么,,,
00:14:28.021,00:14:34.950,今天西方国家刺激实际上也感受到了民主原教支局带来的问题,00:14:27.360,00:14:34.480,"Today, Western countries themselves also realize the crisis caused by democracy fundamentalism."
00:14:34.951,00:14:40.080,所以我说那就是历史经验一再证明好民主才是人民之福,00:14:34.620,00:14:37.080,So history has repeatedly proven that
00:14:40.081,00:14:41.730,好名字才是好东西,00:14:37.360,00:14:40.660,"a good democracy is for the benefit of people,"
00:14:41.731,00:14:44.520,烂名知情人士人民在灾难的灾,00:14:40.980,00:14:43.980,while a bad democracy can be nothing but a disaster for the people.
00:14:45.570,00:14:47.640,那么大家可能知道啊,00:14:45.255,00:14:48.265,"As you may know,"
00:14:47.641,00:14:50.280,就是一个经典的难民,00:14:48.460,00:14:53.491,"Adolf Hitler, elected in a multi-party system with a rule of one person one vote,"
00:14:50.281,00:14:56.070,阻碍就是多档次加一人一票选出了德国的希特勒,00:14:53.491,00:14:55.540,is an example of bad democracies.
00:14:56.071,00:15:05.490,那是1933年希特勒的纳粹党利用德国百姓对经济社会特别是年轻的失业问题严重不满,00:14:55.740,00:15:01.580,"In 1933, Germans were strongly dissatisfied with the economy and society,"
00:15:05.491,00:15:07.560,才用民粹主义的手段,00:15:01.580,00:15:05.400,"especially the unemployment of young people,"
00:15:07.561,00:15:13.470,轻而易举的在1933年获得了37 4%的选票,00:15:05.400,00:15:12.000,"Hitler’s Nazi Party exploited the situation and easily won 37.4% of the votes by means of populism,"
00:15:13.471,00:15:15.360,成为德国议会的第一大党,00:15:12.000,00:15:15.940,becoming the largest party in the German parliament.
00:15:16.320,00:15:22.260,我们知道德国是以产生富于理性思考的哲学家威名的,00:15:16.160,00:15:21.760,"Germany is renowned for nurturing rational philosophers,"
00:15:22.261,00:15:27.330,但德国人通过多导致抑郁票选出仇视人类的希特勒,00:15:21.980,00:15:26.680,but the Germans elected Hitler by the rule of one person one vote in the multi-party system.
00:15:27.331,00:15:30.300,不仅给德国带来了灭顶之灾,00:15:26.920,00:15:29.231,He brought a catastrophe to Germany
00:15:30.301,00:15:33.420,甚至几乎毁掉了整个西方的文明,00:15:29.231,00:15:33.060,and even almost destroyed the entire Western civilization.
00:15:33.421,00:15:34.200,我记在想,,,
00:15:34.201,00:15:37.620,如果柏拉图能够活到1933年的话,00:15:33.400,00:15:37.660,"I think, if Plato could have been alive until 1933,"
00:15:37.621,00:15:38.490,他可能会说,,,
00:15:38.491,00:15:40.110,我早就预料到这一切,00:15:37.660,00:15:40.540,"he might have said, I’ve already foreseen this."
00:15:41.160,00:15:44.550,我们可以提一下另外一位古希腊的思想家,00:15:40.800,00:15:46.540,"We can also talk about Aristotle, another ancient Greek thinker."
00:15:44.551,00:15:46.830,哲学家亚里士多德,,,
00:15:46.831,00:15:50.280,那么亚十多的有这么一个动静,00:15:46.760,00:15:50.660,"Aristotle had such an insight,"
00:15:50.281,00:15:50.970,他这样说,,,
00:15:50.971,00:15:52.410,他说就是民主制度,,,
00:15:52.411,00:15:55.860,如果要成功的话需要两个元素,00:15:50.660,00:15:54.920,the success of democracy requires two elements:
00:15:55.861,00:15:56.130,第一,,,
00:15:56.131,00:15:58.770,男神有足够大的中产阶级,00:15:55.540,00:15:58.300,the first is to have a large group of the middle class;
00:15:58.771,00:16:00.630,第二难要有法治,00:15:58.445,00:16:01.305,the second is the rule of law.
00:16:00.631,00:16:03.300,如果你没有一个比较大的中产阶级,00:16:01.305,00:16:03.980,"Without a relatively large group of the middle class,"
00:16:03.301,00:16:04.950,那么亚斯多德认为,,,
00:16:04.951,00:16:06.870,民主制度很难成功,00:16:03.980,00:16:06.400,"Aristotle believed, democracy could hardly succeed,"
00:16:06.871,00:16:09.870,因为如果是一个两极分化的严重的社会,00:16:06.560,00:16:11.720,"because in a polarized society, the poor would be jealous of the rich,"
00:16:09.871,00:16:12.270,他做穷人的会嫉妒富人,,,
00:16:12.271,00:16:15.000,结果社会就出现持续的不稳定,00:16:12.000,00:16:14.855,"As a result, society would be constantly unstable."
00:16:15.001,00:16:15.420,他认为,,,
00:16:15.421,00:16:17.820,中产阶级社会的稳定器,00:16:14.880,00:16:18.459,He believed that the middle-class would act as a stabilizer in society
00:16:17.821,00:16:19.650,你总裁你自我感觉很好,00:16:18.459,00:16:19.840,because they are satisfied.
00:16:19.651,00:16:20.010,是吧,,,
00:16:20.011,00:16:22.260,比上不足比下有余,00:16:20.080,00:16:22.400,They are not as well off as the upper class but better than the lower class.
00:16:22.261,00:16:24.090,那法制他人也非常重要,,,
00:16:24.091,00:16:27.960,因为你这个要维持民主政权,00:16:22.600,00:16:26.120,"He believed that the rule of law was also very important,"
00:16:27.961,00:16:31.380,特别是当社会出现各种各样争议的时候,00:16:26.120,00:16:30.800,"because when maintaining a democracy, especially one with various disputes,"
00:16:31.381,00:16:35.040,没有法子就没办法解决各种问题,00:16:31.080,00:16:34.420,we can't resolve problems without the rule of law.
00:16:35.041,00:16:36.420,如果解决不好,,,
00:16:36.421,00:16:37.950,解之谜还可能发酵,00:16:34.660,00:16:39.280,"If they are not well settled, they may get more serious and even destroy a country."
00:16:37.951,00:16:38.940,甚至毁灭一个鬼,,,
00:16:39.840,00:16:43.110,我们现在在今天的这个估计真的会看到的,00:16:39.540,00:16:42.460,It can be seen in international politics that
00:16:43.111,00:16:44.940,一旦选举出现了选票,00:16:42.460,00:16:46.600,"once there is a dispute on the counting of the ballots,"
00:16:44.941,00:16:46.980,统计上有争议,,,
00:16:46.981,00:16:49.590,一般说是最高法院来裁决,00:16:46.900,00:16:49.320,"generally, the supreme court decides the final result."
00:16:49.591,00:16:53.160,但很多国家他不买最高法院的着,00:16:49.520,00:16:52.720,"However, in many countries, people don't accept the arbitration of the supreme court."
00:16:53.161,00:16:54.660,那么就是没有法治了,00:16:52.960,00:16:55.880,"In that case, the rule of law doesn’t work and eventually leads to chaos."
00:16:54.661,00:16:56.520,这就导致混乱,,,
00:16:56.521,00:16:58.380,那么谁叫我们想一想,00:16:56.205,00:16:59.255,Let's think about this.
00:16:58.381,00:17:01.290,就是采用西方民主制度之后,00:16:59.255,00:17:02.195,"After adopting the western democratic system,"
00:17:01.291,00:17:03.630,很多国家陷入危机,,,
00:17:03.631,00:17:04.410,陷入动漫,00:17:02.195,00:17:05.235,many countries have been thrown into crisis and turmoil.
00:17:04.411,00:17:06.540,确实和这两个因素有关,00:17:05.240,00:17:07.020,"Indeed, it has something to do with these two factors."
00:17:06.541,00:17:09.630,一个是没有中产阶级或钻机很小,00:17:07.020,00:17:09.960,"One is the lack of a middle class.
Or it's too small."
00:17:09.631,00:17:11.850,一直没有法制的传统,00:17:10.220,00:17:11.760,the other is the absence of the tradition of the rule of law.
,,,00:17:11.900,00:17:13.342,"In the past, there was a view that"
00:17:11.851,00:17:15.630,但估计有种观点就是西方国家都是成熟的民主国家,00:17:13.342,00:17:16.100,"western countries were all mature democracies, especially the US."
00:17:15.631,00:17:18.780,特别像美国那名民主制度非常成熟,00:17:16.120,00:17:20.440,It seemed that they would never experience such crises.
00:17:18.781,00:17:21.090,不会经历这样的问题,,,
00:17:21.091,00:17:22.170,大家可能记得,,,
00:17:22.171,00:17:26.280,当时这个特朗普和希拉里进行竞选的辩论,00:17:20.760,00:17:25.860,You may remember that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had a campaign debate.
00:17:26.281,00:17:27.390,电视节目主持人,,,
00:17:27.391,00:17:29.280,我姐叫华莱士,00:17:26.320,00:17:31.160,"The host of the TV show, Wallace (if I remember right) asked Trump"
00:17:29.281,00:17:30.720,他问特朗普,,,
00:17:30.721,00:17:32.790,万一您输了,,,
00:17:32.791,00:17:36.210,您是否会接受这次投票的结果,00:17:31.160,00:17:35.120,"if he lost, would he accept the result of this voting?"
00:17:36.211,00:17:38.940,汤普斯面对着摄像机啊,00:17:36.080,00:17:41.520,"Trump, facing the camera and hundreds of millions of viewers,"
00:17:38.941,00:17:41.310,面对着这么多的观众上亿的观众,,,
00:17:42.240,00:17:43.230,顾左右而言,,,
00:17:43.231,00:17:45.060,他说,00:17:42.000,00:17:44.600,didn't answer this question directly.
00:17:45.061,00:17:46.680,我留给你一个悬念,,,
00:17:46.681,00:17:47.340,到时候,00:17:44.760,00:17:49.440,"He said, it depended on the situation and he would like to keep it as a secret."
00:17:48.420,00:17:49.710,再说,,,
00:17:49.711,00:17:50.910,另外藏他又说了,,,
00:17:50.911,00:17:51.420,当然,,,
00:17:51.421,00:17:57.240,我会接受完全公正无误的投票结果,00:17:49.440,00:17:56.520,"In another debate, he said he would accept a completely fair and justice voting result."
00:17:57.241,00:17:59.310,在画出粤语话,00:17:57.020,00:17:58.460,The words meant more than he said.
00:17:59.311,00:18:00.600,但我要保留质疑,,,
00:18:00.601,00:18:05.100,并调查存在疑问的投票结果的钱也就说过去之中,00:17:59.400,00:18:03.500,He reserved the right to question and investigate if the results were questionable.
00:18:05.101,00:18:06.750,所谓法治就是不玩什么的,00:18:03.960,00:18:07.980,"In other words, in the past, no matter what happens,"
00:18:06.751,00:18:07.260,最后,,,
00:18:07.261,00:18:11.730,最高法院决定你认同不认同都得接受这种情况,00:18:07.980,00:18:11.320,The Supreme Court's decision must be accepted whether you agree or not.
00:18:11.731,00:18:13.560,现在在美国都动摇了,00:18:11.320,00:18:13.040,Now even the United States begins to question it.
00:18:13.561,00:18:16.470,所以当时美国主流媒体哗然,00:18:13.220,00:18:16.060,"Therefore, the mainstream US media was in an uproar."
,,,00:18:16.140,00:18:18.265,They thought it was unimaginable that
00:18:16.471,00:18:23.040,因为这个美国总统候选都准备挑战美国的法治的时候不可思议了,00:18:18.265,00:18:21.940,US presidential candidates prepared to challenge the rule of law
00:18:23.041,00:18:26.910,说美国政治变得越来越像第三世界的真情,00:18:22.120,00:18:26.620,and US politics became more and more similar to that of the third world.
00:18:26.911,00:18:28.680,那么最近情况也是类似的,00:18:26.960,00:18:28.860,The recent situation is also going this way.
00:18:28.681,00:18:33.900,就是美国媒体经常报道特朗普在国内面临各种各样的指控,00:18:29.060,00:18:33.460,"US media often reported that Trump was facing various charges,"
00:18:33.901,00:18:38.040,从这个通俄门到偷税漏税,00:18:33.520,00:18:40.940,"including secret communication with Russia, tax evasion and affairs."
00:18:38.041,00:18:41.550,到婚外情等等各种各样的指控,,,
00:18:41.551,00:18:45.090,那么甚至可能会被弹劾下台,00:18:40.940,00:18:44.400,so that he might even be impeached.
00:18:45.091,00:18:48.120,但特朗普的律师如迪朱利安尼,00:18:44.720,00:18:50.000,"But according to Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, a senior Republican politician as well,"
00:18:48.121,00:18:48.540,他说,,,
00:18:48.541,00:18:50.850,他也是为共和党资深的政客,,,
00:18:50.851,00:18:51.180,他说,,,
00:18:51.181,00:18:52.470,如果这样做的话啊,00:18:50.320,00:18:52.285,"if Trump was impeached,"
00:18:52.471,00:18:56.370,弹劾特朗普的话会让美国陷入混乱,00:18:52.285,00:18:55.746,"the United States might sink into chaos,"
00:18:56.371,00:18:59.280,有些支持特朗普的民主会造反,00:18:55.746,00:18:59.120,and some Trump supporters would revolt.
00:18:59.281,00:19:01.110,已经有很多的媒体报道,,,
00:19:01.111,00:19:02.760,如果汤不遭弹劾的话,00:18:59.260,00:19:04.640,"Many reports already said that if Trump got impeached, his fans would riot."
00:19:02.761,00:19:04.080,他的粉丝会暴动,00:19:05.080,00:19:07.860,So many Americans lament that
00:19:05.430,00:19:12.690,所以今天很多美国人在感叹美国曾经一次好的一个名字是越来越像第三世界国家的民族水平,00:19:07.860,00:19:10.620,the democracy that the United States once took pride in
,,,00:19:10.620,00:19:13.180,is declining to the level of third world countries.
00:19:13.770,00:19:18.630,那么其实仓库自己好几次在集会上也说,00:19:13.440,00:19:20.920,"Trump has declared several times that the United States is a developing country,"
00:19:18.631,00:19:20.430,他说没货就是个发展的国家,,,
00:19:20.431,00:19:21.450,哈哈,,,
00:19:21.451,00:19:23.550,所以他想使美国再次伟大,00:19:21.140,00:19:23.785,so that he wants to make the United States great again and
00:19:23.551,00:19:25.320,摆脱对发展中国家的地位,00:19:23.785,00:19:26.020,lift it out of the group of developing countries.
00:19:26.610,00:19:26.910,那么,,,
00:19:26.911,00:19:29.190,另外我想我们谈民族肯定不能回避,00:19:26.280,00:19:28.560,"In addition, when we talk about democracy,"
00:19:29.191,00:19:33.810,另外一位非常重要的法国的启蒙思想家卢梭,00:19:28.560,00:19:33.520,"we certainly cannot skip another very important French enlightenment thinker, Rousseau."
00:19:33.811,00:19:39.060,那么他是在西方比较早地提出了主权在民的思想,00:19:33.780,00:19:38.480,He put forward the idea of popular sovereignty relatively early in the West.
00:19:39.061,00:19:42.840,那么这个思想激励了一代又一代的这个欧洲,00:19:38.840,00:19:42.940,"This idea inspired generations of Europeans,"
00:19:42.841,00:19:45.450,特别是法国的仁人志士,00:19:42.940,00:19:45.345,especially the Frenchmen with lofty ideals
00:19:45.451,00:19:47.670,甚至可以为民族抛头颅,00:19:45.345,00:19:48.780,who could even sacrifice themselves in pursuit of democracy.
00:19:47.671,00:19:48.210,洒热血,,,
00:19:49.260,00:19:49.530,那么,,,
00:19:49.531,00:19:52.740,在他这个社会契约论这个梳理,00:19:48.920,00:19:55.740,"In his work "" The Social Contract"", he put forward a very insightful idea,"
00:19:52.741,00:19:54.840,他说提出一个观点,,,
00:19:54.841,00:19:56.250,我就很有见地,,,
00:19:56.251,00:19:59.220,我们很多学者好像引用的不多,00:19:55.980,00:19:58.820,that Chinese scholars are not likely to cite it.
00:19:59.221,00:20:00.060,他说,,,
00:20:00.061,00:20:03.390,你假设如果你生活在国家很小,00:19:58.960,00:20:04.760,"He proposes that if you live in a very small country with only 10,000 citizens,"
00:20:03.391,00:20:04.470,就一万个宫女,,,
00:20:05.400,00:20:06.930,那你手中珍贵的一票,,,
00:20:06.931,00:20:09.840,他的影响力是万分之一,00:20:05.060,00:20:09.180,"the influence of the vote in your hand can be measured as 1/10,000."
00:20:09.841,00:20:13.440,但如果这个国家人口变成了十万,00:20:09.520,00:20:12.960,"But if the population rises to 100,000,"
00:20:13.441,00:20:16.980,那你手中最漂的影响一下就减少了十倍,00:20:13.080,00:20:18.880,"the influence of your vote will be reduced to 1/100,000, only one-tenth of the former one."
00:20:16.981,00:20:18.390,变成了十万分之一,,,
00:20:19.470,00:20:20.100,同样弱智,,,
00:20:20.101,00:20:22.110,国家人口变成一百万,00:20:19.180,00:20:21.785,"In this way, if the population is 1 million,"
00:20:22.111,00:20:28.500,你的影响力就更想你这个一票的影响力就减少了一百倍,00:20:21.785,00:20:27.920,"your influence will be even smaller, only one-hundredth of the first one."
00:20:28.501,00:20:29.760,所以他的结论很简单,00:20:28.140,00:20:29.800,So his conclusion is simple.
00:20:29.761,00:20:31.200,你人口越多,,,
00:20:31.201,00:20:33.570,这个选票的影响力越小,00:20:29.940,00:20:32.900,"The larger the population is, the smaller the influence of the vote is,"
00:20:33.571,00:20:35.370,阵子离你就越远,00:20:32.920,00:20:34.740,and the farther the politics is from you.
00:20:35.371,00:20:40.140,所以他觉得这个民族这个制度特别是通过选举将事主来搞民主,00:20:35.000,00:20:41.340,"Therefore, he thinks that democracy with elections is only suitable for small countries,"
00:20:40.141,00:20:41.730,那只适合小国家,,,
00:20:41.731,00:20:45.720,而且小国家这个贫富差距千万不能太大,00:20:41.900,00:20:47.620,especially those without a large wealth gap or intense social conflicts.
00:20:45.721,00:20:47.670,社会矛盾不能太激烈,,,
00:20:47.671,00:20:51.720,否则民族是很难事情就当时就讲了这样一个观点,00:20:47.620,00:20:50.800,"Otherwise, democracy will be difficult to implement."
00:20:51.721,00:20:53.580,只戒酒就是有道理的,00:20:50.800,00:20:52.940,I think it makes sense.
00:20:53.581,00:20:55.830,那么国家规模越大,00:20:52.940,00:20:58.580,"The larger a country is, the smaller influence people can feel from their votes."
00:20:55.831,00:20:59.250,自己感觉手中的一票的影响力就越小,,,
00:20:59.251,00:21:02.970,所以我就像中国这样的将近14亿人口的国家,00:20:58.880,00:21:04.340,This is the serious issue that a country like China with a population of 1.4 billion
00:21:02.971,00:21:08.580,在建设民族确实是要思考这么一个很严肃的问题,00:21:04.340,00:21:08.000,should consider when developing democracy.
00:21:08.581,00:21:15.870,那么还要提一下就是西方自由主义的另外一位很有名的靴子要哈耶克,00:21:08.240,00:21:15.200,I would also like to talk about another famous scholar of Western liberalism called Friedrich Hayek.
00:21:15.871,00:21:19.170,那么他对民主制度也有很多疑虑,00:21:15.520,00:21:18.600,He also has many doubts about democracy.
00:21:19.171,00:21:19.500,他说,,,
00:21:19.501,00:21:24.240,这个民族应该严格都被界定为一种决策程序,00:21:18.640,00:21:23.233,"He believes that democracy should be strictly defined as a decision-making process,"
00:21:24.241,00:21:27.600,一种程序民主而不是终极价值,00:21:23.233,00:21:26.720,"a kind of procedural democracy, rather than the ultimate value."
00:21:27.601,00:21:29.040,就不能为民转民主,00:21:27.440,00:21:29.760,Democracy itself is not the final goal.
00:21:30.150,00:21:34.230,不管你如何评价哈耶克的几个自由主义学说,00:21:29.940,00:21:33.940,"No matter what’s your remark on Hayek's liberalism,"
00:21:34.231,00:21:35.730,这个很有争议,00:21:33.940,00:21:36.920,it’s indeed a very controversial idea.
00:21:35.731,00:21:37.110,但他他这样说的,,,
00:21:37.111,00:21:41.520,我们无意创造一种民主拜物教,00:21:36.920,00:21:40.700,"He said, ""We never intend to create a fetish of democracy."
00:21:41.521,00:21:46.020,我们这一代人可能过多的谈论和考虑民主,00:21:40.700,00:21:45.980,It may well be that our generation consider and discuss too much of democracy
00:21:46.021,00:21:53.160,而没有足够的重视民主所要服务的价值处置这段话是蛮有见地,00:21:45.980,00:21:49.580,"but too little of the values it aims to serve."""
,,,00:21:49.980,00:21:52.660,I think it is quite insightful.
00:21:53.161,00:21:56.070,那么他非常反对民主多数的滥用,00:21:52.920,00:21:55.820,"He is strongly opposed to the abuse of democracy in most countries,"
00:21:56.071,00:21:59.760,因为即使多数同意的决定也不一定具有合法性,00:21:56.080,00:21:59.520,because even decisions made by the majority are not necessarily legitimate.
00:21:59.761,00:22:03.600,比如说大部分如果决定要分掉小部分的财产,00:21:59.900,00:22:03.620,"For example, if the majority reach a consensus on dividing up the property of the minority,"
00:22:03.601,00:22:05.010,他说这个就不行,00:22:03.620,00:22:04.560,this is not legitimate.
00:22:05.011,00:22:08.130,而他提出的概念民主拜物教也很有意思,00:22:04.645,00:22:07.465,The concept of fetish of democracy defined by him is also interesting.
00:22:08.131,00:22:11.130,有点像我分享的民主原教之处,00:22:07.465,00:22:10.345,Itis a bit like the democracy fundamentalism in our words.
00:22:11.131,00:22:13.980,那些极力在全世界推销西方民族,00:22:10.560,00:22:16.594,"Almost all of those who strive to promote Western democracy or American democracy to the world,"
00:22:13.981,00:22:14.430,美声,,,
00:22:14.431,00:22:20.010,民族的球都是民主拜物教信徒都是明军民主园,00:22:16.594,00:22:21.040,are believers in the fetish of democracy and democracy fundamentalism.
00:22:20.011,00:22:24.030,教育局不清楚都是主张为民主而民主,00:22:21.440,00:22:24.402,They advocate implementing democracy just for democracy
00:22:24.031,00:22:25.380,这个而且是一定要用的,,,
00:22:25.381,00:22:27.540,西方名字这么一种形式,00:22:24.402,00:22:26.880,and think it a must to adopt the Western form.
00:22:27.541,00:22:31.320,结果后果我们看到把多少国家搞得四分五裂,00:22:27.220,00:22:30.680,We have seen the result -- so many countries have been torn apart.
00:22:31.321,00:22:34.980,而且实际上导致的希望自己这个一路走衰,00:22:30.980,00:22:35.360,And the fetish actually has caused the West to decline along the way.
00:22:36.060,00:22:36.630,那么,,,
00:22:36.631,00:22:39.660,随着2008年金融危机的爆发,00:22:35.760,00:22:38.650,With the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2009
00:22:39.661,00:22:44.460,其实阿拉伯之春便拿了不知东西方民主的光环,00:22:38.650,00:22:41.540,"and the Arab Spring turning into the Arab Winter,"
00:22:44.461,00:22:47.700,在全世界范围迅速褪色,00:22:41.540,00:22:47.220,the attraction of Western democracy is rapidly fading out in the world.
,,,00:22:47.360,00:22:49.120,But we should still note that
00:22:47.701,00:22:52.860,但我们还是要注意就西方民主模式尽管遭遇重大挫折,00:22:49.120,00:22:52.520,"although Western democracy has suffered serious setbacks,"
00:22:52.861,00:22:57.480,但西方民主这个话语的红利还没有耗尽,00:22:52.780,00:22:58.800,the dividend of Western democracy hasn’t been totally depleted yet.
00:22:57.481,00:22:59.040,还没有完全消失,,,
00:22:59.041,00:23:02.220,我们有些人还被忽悠得不亦乐乎,00:22:59.160,00:23:03.400,"Some people are still being fooled, which is actually very stupid."
00:23:02.221,00:23:03.210,实在是非常傻,,,
00:23:04.260,00:23:05.790,正是在这个意义上,00:23:03.920,00:23:05.967,"Considering things above,"
00:23:05.791,00:23:08.190,我认为光说名字是好东西啊,,,
00:23:08.191,00:23:09.630,是不够的,00:23:05.967,00:23:10.880,I think we shouldn't simply conclude that democracy is good.
00:23:09.631,00:23:12.210,因为你说汽车是个好东西,,,
00:23:12.211,00:23:13.890,与汽车比马车跑,00:23:10.880,00:23:15.280,We may say cars are good because they run faster than horse-drawn carriages.
00:23:13.891,00:23:14.970,谁都懂这个道理,,,
00:23:15.990,00:23:18.480,当朋友了解道路的状况,00:23:15.640,00:23:18.680,But we also need to consider the condition of the road.
00:23:18.481,00:23:19.800,如果是泥泞的小路,00:23:18.685,00:23:20.835,"If we are on a muddy path, cars can’t go smoothly."
00:23:19.801,00:23:21.810,汽车就没法开了,,,
00:23:21.811,00:23:24.090,还有比汽车跑得更快的交通工具,00:23:21.280,00:23:23.823,"Moreover, we have other vehicles that move faster than cars,"
00:23:24.091,00:23:25.710,我们可以高铁磁悬浮,00:23:23.823,00:23:26.960,"such as high-speed rails, magnetic levitation trains, airplanes and so on."
00:23:26.730,00:23:27.720,飞机等等,,,
00:23:27.721,00:23:29.970,人类还会有新的创新,00:23:27.600,00:23:29.280,And we can invent new things.
,,,00:23:29.600,00:23:32.355,"So instead of regarding democracy as a good system,"
00:23:29.971,00:23:34.740,所以预期说名字就好东西还不如说好名字才是好东西,00:23:32.355,00:23:34.840,we should say good democracy is a good system.
00:23:36.030,00:23:40.050,那么有人又讲了你们这样描述张老师,00:23:35.700,00:23:37.835,"Then some people may ask,"
00:23:40.051,00:23:40.740,你这样说,00:23:37.835,00:23:42.960,would your expressions complicate discussions on this issue?
00:23:40.741,00:23:43.890,会不会是很多讨论变得复杂化地方,,,
00:23:43.891,00:23:44.670,你也可以说,00:23:43.220,00:23:46.030,"For example, when we define socialism as a good thing,"
00:23:44.671,00:23:46.770,我们讲社会主义是好东西,,,
00:23:46.771,00:23:49.560,你是不是也要说好社会主义才是好东西,00:23:46.030,00:23:49.100,should we refer it in particular as good socialism instead?
00:23:49.561,00:23:50.610,今日问我这个问题,00:23:49.500,00:23:51.340,"Actually, someone asked me this question."
00:23:51.990,00:23:54.450,那么时间我倒觉得问题没有那么复杂,00:23:51.700,00:23:55.000,I don't think the issue is that complicated. Why?
00:23:54.451,00:23:58.770,为什么关键时就是民族这个概念,00:23:55.520,00:24:00.480,"The point is that the concept of democracy was ""registered"" by the west first."
00:23:58.771,00:24:00.600,他已经被西方先注册,,,
00:24:01.710,00:24:04.860,先你讲的民族在世界多数国家,00:24:01.360,00:24:04.080,"Now when you talk about democracy,"
00:24:04.861,00:24:07.680,他们首先想到是西方民主制度形式,00:24:04.520,00:24:07.209,in most countries people will immediately think of Western democracy
00:24:07.681,00:24:10.110,多档次奖励一票,00:24:07.209,00:24:09.780,"with a multi-party system with the rule of ""one person one vote""."
00:24:10.111,00:24:12.060,所以他是一个这样的概念,00:24:09.800,00:24:14.040,The west defines democracy as western democracy and this narrative dominates.
00:24:12.061,00:24:15.000,被他或多或少垄断之后,,,
00:24:15.001,00:24:17.670,我们觉得就容易出现误解,00:24:14.040,00:24:16.540,"As a result, we often misunderstand democracy."
00:24:17.671,00:24:19.290,和你讲社会显得不大,00:24:16.540,00:24:20.800,"As for socialism, such a kind of misunderstanding is not likely to happen."
00:24:19.291,00:24:20.940,会出现这个问题,,,
00:24:20.941,00:24:24.660,所以我觉得我们加上个形容词好还是坏好孩子啦,00:24:20.800,00:24:26.000,Adding an adjective like good or bad can make the connotation of democracy clearer.
00:24:24.661,00:24:26.700,可以把问题说得更清楚,,,
00:24:26.701,00:24:28.440,我还要讲一观点,00:24:26.560,00:24:28.898,Another fact that I want to make it clear is that
00:24:28.441,00:24:32.550,就是随着西方民族自身危机的加深,00:24:28.898,00:24:31.760,"as the crisis of Western democracy is becoming more serious,"
00:24:32.551,00:24:39.000,越来越多的西方的有识之士看到了自己自足的危机,00:24:32.240,00:24:38.360,more and more people of insight in the west have noticed the crisis of their own system.
00:24:39.001,00:24:42.060,大家可能知道就是2011年的时候,00:24:38.360,00:24:41.880,"As you may know, Belgium, a small country in Europe,"
00:24:42.061,00:24:46.350,欧洲的小国比利时经历过了有史以来,00:24:42.020,00:24:46.620,"experienced a political crisis in 2011, lasting for the longest period in its history."
00:24:47.400,00:24:49.410,历史最长的五百多天,00:24:47.000,00:24:51.600,They went through a period of more than 500 days without a central government.
00:24:49.411,00:24:51.150,没有中央政府的政治危机,,,
00:24:52.770,00:24:57.390,当时比利时的一些知识分子相当大的一个群体,00:24:52.160,00:24:59.520,"At that time, a fairly large group of intellectuals in Belgium proposed G1000 Manifesto."
00:24:57.391,00:25:00.360,专门发表了一个叫做千人集团宣言,,,
00:25:00.361,00:25:02.250,他就网上可以查到,00:24:59.820,00:25:01.520,You can find it on the Internet.
00:25:02.251,00:25:05.670,那么他这个宣言讲得非常直白,00:25:01.915,00:25:05.075,This Manifesto is very straightforward.
00:25:05.671,00:25:06.300,他说,,,
00:25:06.301,00:25:08.220,先让我们看一看这个世界,00:25:05.280,00:25:09.160,"It says that in this world, in addition to democracy,"
00:25:08.221,00:25:09.930,除了民主之外,,,
00:25:09.931,00:25:13.710,全员界的革新创新无处不在,00:25:09.160,00:25:13.180,innovations of anything is happening all over the world.
00:25:13.711,00:25:16.140,你办公室必须不断创新,00:25:13.460,00:25:15.490,Companies need innovations.
00:25:16.141,00:25:18.930,可以加比不断的跨越学科,00:25:15.490,00:25:20.000,Scientists must strive to break the barriers of discipline.
00:25:18.931,00:25:21.060,这个藩篱往前努力,00:25:20.240,00:25:22.711,Athletes must try to break world records;
00:25:21.061,00:25:25.350,运动员比不断的打破世界纪依家比不断的推陈出新,00:25:22.711,00:25:24.820,Artists must make creative efforts.
00:25:25.351,00:25:27.060,但一谈到政治,,,
00:25:27.061,00:25:29.640,谈到社会政治组织形式,00:25:25.020,00:25:29.200,"But when it comes to politics and the way society is organized,"
00:25:29.641,00:25:29.940,他说,,,
00:25:29.941,00:25:35.610,我们仍然满足1830年代的成绩,00:25:29.600,00:25:35.480,we are still satisfied with the procedures established in the 1830s.
00:25:35.611,00:25:40.140,我们为什么必须死豹子两百年的古董不放,00:25:35.480,00:25:40.440,Why must we hold tight the 200-year-old antiques?
00:25:40.141,00:25:44.040,使民族应该是活着的有机体,00:25:40.800,00:25:43.400,Democracy should be a living organism.
00:25:44.041,00:25:47.340,民主的形式并非固定不变,00:25:43.695,00:25:46.975,The form of democracy is not fixed.
00:25:47.341,00:25:51.720,应该随着时代的需要不断的成长,00:25:46.980,00:25:51.590,It should continue to grow in pace with the needs of the times.
00:25:51.721,00:25:52.860,这个见解仅到,00:25:51.590,00:25:53.200,Their word made sense.
00:25:54.030,00:25:54.840,那么,,,
00:25:54.841,00:26:00.900,石家庄我在想这个西方这么多的有头脑的责任,00:25:53.640,00:26:04.600,So many wise philosophers in the west have actually considered democracy very seriously.
00:26:00.901,00:26:03.000,对民主制度是这样的,,,
00:26:03.001,00:26:04.890,经过很认真的思考,,,
00:26:04.891,00:26:07.530,不管他们的异性的倾向如何,,,
00:26:07.531,00:26:09.720,不管他们对其他的观点,00:26:04.680,00:26:10.900,"No matter what their ideologies are and whether you agree with their views or not,"
00:26:09.721,00:26:11.310,你同意不同意,,,
00:26:11.311,00:26:18.270,但是我觉得他们对这个民族问题思考的水平总体上看远远高于我们,00:26:11.320,00:26:15.800,"in general, their consideration is much deeper than those so-called liberals,"
00:26:18.271,00:26:20.880,现在那些所谓自由派,00:26:15.800,00:26:24.220,who have been spreading western democracy throughout the world.
00:26:20.881,00:26:24.720,你也在全世界到处推广西方民主模式,,,
00:26:24.721,00:26:25.680,这个坦率来讲,,,
00:26:25.681,00:26:28.230,1776年通过的美国独立宣言,00:26:24.360,00:26:30.380,"""All men are created equal"", written in ""The Declaration of Independence"", was adopted in 1776."
00:26:28.231,00:26:30.570,理想的人人生而平等,,,
00:26:30.571,00:26:31.590,其中的渊源,,,
00:26:32.460,00:26:33.540,不包括妇女,,,
00:26:33.541,00:26:34.680,不包括奴隶,00:26:30.640,00:26:37.860,"In fact, the ""men"" excluded women, slaves, Chinese, and poor white people."
00:26:34.681,00:26:35.820,不包括华人,,,
00:26:35.821,00:26:38.610,也不包括白云中的穷,,,
00:26:38.611,00:26:43.890,我老说的美国十196才真正开始搞一人一票,00:26:38.280,00:26:44.000,I always say that the United States didn’t start to implement “one person one vote” until 1965.
00:26:43.891,00:26:46.200,美国模式中国模式都是新生,00:26:44.200,00:26:46.995,The US model and the China model were both newly born.
00:26:46.201,00:26:48.750,是两个模式可以进军,00:26:47.000,00:26:48.460,They can compete against each other.
00:26:48.751,00:26:51.600,我自己一直是更看好中国模式,00:26:48.460,00:26:51.040,I have always been more optimistic about the China model.
00:26:51.601,00:26:54.600,我们这个模式当然还在不断完善之中,00:26:51.320,00:26:53.335,"Certainly, it is still being improved and contains problems."
00:26:54.601,00:26:56.160,还有自己的问题,00:26:53.360,00:26:56.720,"I dare to say, even with this level,"
00:26:56.161,00:26:57.210,但我也讲几句,,,
00:26:57.211,00:27:00.780,现在这个水平也是可以竞争很激烈,00:26:56.720,00:27:00.080,it is competitive with the US model.
00:27:00.781,00:27:05.490,但我们应该通过改革使他能够更好的运作,00:27:00.080,00:27:04.800,But we still need to reform it to make it better.
00:27:05.491,00:27:07.140,那么最后我也享受一下,00:27:05.200,00:27:07.220,"At last, I would like to say,"
00:27:07.141,00:27:10.290,就我今天刚才讲的时间大多数都是谈的,00:27:07.220,00:27:11.220,what I said just now is about the views of western thinkers and scholars
00:27:10.291,00:27:19.590,西方思想家西方的学者关于民主弊病思考或者关于组织建设民主一些有意义的观点,00:27:11.220,00:27:19.340,on the disadvantages of democracy or how to develop it.
00:27:19.591,00:27:22.050,那么以后还有机会跟大家聊聊,00:27:19.340,00:27:21.300,"In the future,"
00:27:22.051,00:27:26.670,中国人对民族对西方民族或者民族本性的很多看法,00:27:21.580,00:27:26.475,I would love to talk about Chinese people’s views on this issue.
00:27:26.671,00:27:27.000,好吧,,,
00:27:27.001,00:27:27.840,今天就说到这里,00:27:26.475,00:27:28.245,That's all for today. Thank you all.
00:27:27.841,00:27:28.320,谢谢大家,,,
00:27:30.120,00:27:31.080,掌声送给张老师,00:27:29.815,00:27:31.575,Let’s applaud Prof. Zhang. Please have a seat.
00:27:31.081,00:27:31.800,张F座,,,
00:27:33.150,00:27:35.190,你接着我们就进入现场的头脑风暴,00:27:32.805,00:27:35.215,Now it is time for brainstorm.
00:27:35.191,00:27:37.980,我先看看我们的面前会小组有些什么观点,00:27:35.215,00:27:38.145,"First, we'd love to hear the view from the pre-production team."
00:27:37.981,00:27:40.440,刚才您演讲也提到的就是民主,00:27:38.145,00:27:39.880,"As you mentioned in your speech just now,"
00:27:40.441,00:27:41.700,要在一定的条件下,00:27:40.000,00:27:42.640,democracy can only work under certain conditions.
00:27:41.701,00:27:42.870,现在很多人说,,,
00:27:42.871,00:27:43.140,哎呀,,,
00:27:43.141,00:27:45.210,中国为什么没有民主,00:27:42.640,00:27:45.520,Many people may ask why China isn't a democracy.
00:27:45.211,00:27:46.590,所谓没有他的名字,,,
00:27:46.591,00:27:48.030,能有多脏脏的名字,00:27:45.600,00:27:47.980,They mean western democracy.
00:27:48.031,00:27:51.540,是因为我们的这个人民素质还不到台湾就这个问题,00:27:48.220,00:27:50.860,Because Chinese people's political quality isn't high enough.
,,,00:27:51.100,00:27:52.140,This is the problem of Taiwan.
00:27:51.541,00:27:54.360,台湾地区很多双向我现在台湾把民主搞成明确,00:27:52.420,00:27:53.791,"Many people in Taiwan believe,"
00:27:54.361,00:27:56.310,就是因为我们的素质不如美国,00:27:53.791,00:27:58.180,Taiwan is turning democracy into populism because they are low in quality compared to Americans.
00:27:56.311,00:27:58.050,可现在问题是英国,,,
00:27:58.051,00:28:00.450,美国他的这个民主都出现了问题,00:27:58.440,00:28:01.260,But now there are also problems in democracy of the UK and the US.
00:28:00.451,00:28:07.020,那么您认为现在中国我们是否已经具备了我们要实行的民主的这个组织部,00:28:01.920,00:28:06.680,So do you think that Chinese people has the qualities to practice our democracy?
00:28:07.021,00:28:10.320,中国现在探索的这个民族,,,
00:28:10.321,00:28:17.820,从他内容到形式都要力求符合现在这个阶段中国的民情国情,00:28:06.960,00:28:17.360,No. Both content and form of the democracy China is exploring should adjust itself to the national conditions at the current stage.
,,,00:28:17.360,00:28:18.607,"I also mentioned last time,"
00:28:17.821,00:28:21.390,上次我讲过为什么协商民主发挥着重要作用,00:28:18.607,00:28:21.240,why consultative democracy played such an important role?
00:28:21.391,00:28:22.890,就人口规模这么大,00:28:21.240,00:28:23.220,The first reason is the size of the population.
00:28:22.891,00:28:25.590,人口规模如果你10%不同意,00:28:23.440,00:28:26.560,"With such a large population, 10% of disagreement means 140 million people’s opinions."
00:28:25.591,00:28:28.830,就一四千万人中妙协商协商,00:28:26.980,00:28:29.760,So we have to consult people's opinions.
00:28:28.831,00:28:29.730,实际上啊,,,
00:28:29.731,00:28:31.950,我们过去是有这么个思路的,00:28:29.760,00:28:32.000,In fact this idea began early before.
00:28:31.951,00:28:36.300,为什么我们现在这个乡村一起进行村委会的职权,00:28:32.000,00:28:36.880,"That’s why direct elections in villages were implemented with ""one person one vote""."
00:28:36.301,00:28:40.920,一人一票当时甚至提出过的以后进入到乡一级,00:28:37.360,00:28:41.710,"We even proposed to elect leaders all along in this way,"
00:28:40.921,00:28:43.290,而进入到现已挤进了省一级,,,
00:28:43.291,00:28:46.590,就像国家元首这四项都提出过,00:28:41.710,00:28:46.680,"for the county level, municipal level, provincial level and finally for the state."
00:28:46.591,00:28:48.570,但是我们试验了30年了,,,
00:28:48.571,00:28:49.590,坦率的说,00:28:46.680,00:28:51.680,"After 30 years of practice, frankly speaking, it was not efficient as we had expected."
00:28:49.591,00:28:52.050,效果不是十分理想,,,
00:28:52.051,00:28:54.090,刚才张教授在演讲中我注意到,00:28:51.700,00:28:54.555,"There’s one thing that I noticed in the speech of Prof. Zhang,"
00:28:54.091,00:28:58.920,其实战术从这个西方民主产生的这个历史一路讲来,00:28:54.555,00:28:58.085,"When he talked about the history of western democracy,"
00:28:58.921,00:29:01.170,大家会注意到他特别强调的一点,00:28:58.085,00:29:03.474,he emphasized that we should not oversimplify democracy
00:29:01.171,00:29:01.680,就说,,,
00:29:01.681,00:29:05.010,我们不要把它的内容简单化了,,,
00:29:05.011,00:29:07.560,简单化到他只剩下程序了,00:29:03.474,00:29:07.100,and turn it into a procedural system.
00:29:07.561,00:29:10.230,其实他可能是一个要精心设计的,00:29:07.360,00:29:12.780,It should be well designed and rich in content.
00:29:10.231,00:29:12.330,要有着丰富内涵的内容,,,
00:29:12.331,00:29:13.980,但是最后如果我们就是简化的,,,
00:29:13.981,00:29:16.020,他就是那点形式叫做民主,00:29:13.280,00:29:16.060,"If we focus too much on the democratic form,"
00:29:16.021,00:29:19.890,这个可能就是我们现在对他的一个最大的不叫误解,00:29:16.060,00:29:23.620,it may be a reflection for us rather than misunderstanding.
00:29:19.891,00:29:20.640,而事实上,,,
00:29:20.641,00:29:23.220,确实他带给我们的一个最大的反思,,,
00:29:23.221,00:29:24.330,就在这儿,,,
00:29:24.331,00:29:25.590,那么以前的我们这个民族,,,
00:29:25.591,00:29:26.640,如果像任何一种东西,00:29:23.960,00:29:27.780,Everything has two sides like coins.
00:29:26.641,00:29:28.200,都有两面一个硬币一样,,,
00:29:28.201,00:29:30.420,以前大家看到了光鲜的一面,00:29:28.120,00:29:30.340,We only saw the positive side of democracy in the past .
00:29:30.421,00:29:34.110,但近年来越来越多的我们看到硬币的另外一队面,00:29:30.560,00:29:34.000,"In recent years, the other side is coming into our sight more than before."
00:29:34.111,00:29:38.130,比如说民主坑带来民粹主义民族快在多数人的暴政,00:29:34.240,00:29:37.760,"For example, democracy may bring about populism or the tyranny of the majority."
00:29:38.131,00:29:39.600,是我都说人统一的问题,00:29:37.760,00:29:40.845,What the majority agrees on is not always the right choice.
00:29:39.601,00:29:41.310,不一定是正确的选择,,,
00:29:41.311,00:29:43.980,意大利山出来的两个极端的整来一个基友,00:29:40.845,00:29:44.120,"Two extremist political parties were elected in Italy, Five Star Movement and Lega Nord (Northern League)."
00:29:43.981,00:29:45.930,一个机组的五星党和北方联盟,,,
00:29:45.931,00:29:47.280,然后两人当副总理,00:29:44.240,00:29:47.946,"Leaders of these two parties both became deputy prime ministers,"
00:29:47.281,00:29:50.280,最后拿出来一个不太有实权的孔德做总理,00:29:47.946,00:29:50.480,while Giuseppe Conte who has little experience and power was proposed as prime minister.
00:29:50.281,00:29:51.840,因为他控制不了嘛,,,
00:29:51.841,00:29:52.650,两个两方,00:29:50.960,00:29:53.840,"Though the leaders of two parties are appointed by Conte as his deputies, he can't control them."
00:29:52.651,00:29:55.620,难道必须说当副总自动里特别有意思啊,00:29:53.880,00:29:55.520,The deputy prime ministers are very interesting.
00:29:55.621,00:29:59.130,直接到法国的那个黄马甲对黄马甲见面,00:29:55.860,00:29:58.921,"They directly paid a visit to the ""yellow vests"" in France"
,,,00:29:58.921,00:30:00.980,"and supported them to overthrow Macron,"
00:29:59.131,00:30:03.150,只有支持皇马也要推翻那个马克龙直接干涉内政,00:30:01.260,00:30:02.960,interfering in French internal affairs.
00:30:03.151,00:30:05.220,刚才那个张老师提到一个问题,00:30:03.120,00:30:06.560,Prof. Zhang mentioned an issue that triggered my thoughts.
00:30:05.221,00:30:06.930,我觉得挺有感触的,,,
00:30:06.931,00:30:07.440,就是说,,,
00:30:07.441,00:30:09.900,不管是西方式的民主还是其他的制度,00:30:06.560,00:30:09.400,"That is, whether it's Western democracy or other political institutions,"
00:30:09.901,00:30:12.120,他其实确实需要精心设计,00:30:09.400,00:30:11.700,they all have to be elaborately designed.
00:30:12.121,00:30:15.060,就体现在它不只是一个程序进行设计,00:30:11.880,00:30:15.865,"This can be manifested not only in a well-designed procedural democracy,"
00:30:15.061,00:30:19.620,他对于选民还有备选者的这个资格其实都是有要求的,00:30:15.865,00:30:18.300,but also in qualified voters and candidates.
00:30:19.621,00:30:24.750,其实西方这个哲人他们很早也都说过他们预设这些选民应该是理性的,00:30:18.300,00:30:21.080,"A long time ago, western philosophers assumed that"
00:30:24.751,00:30:28.770,能够思考到这个个人能够照顾到整体利益和长远利益的,00:30:21.260,00:30:28.200,voters were rational and able to consider overall and long-term interests.
00:30:28.771,00:30:29.460,但事实上,,,
00:30:29.461,00:30:32.220,我们能够看到这样是很难实现的,00:30:28.500,00:30:31.465,"But in fact, we find it difficult to achieve."
,,,00:30:31.465,00:30:33.360,"As an old saying goes,"
00:30:32.221,00:30:36.210,咱们句古话都说治大国如烹小鲜啊,00:30:33.360,00:30:36.820,governing a great country is similar to how you cook a delicate dish.
00:30:36.211,00:30:38.430,只要非常非常仔细,00:30:36.825,00:30:39.305,You must be extremely careful and patient.
00:30:38.431,00:30:40.230,非常非常的有耐心,,,
00:30:40.231,00:30:42.570,我们来看看现场的观众有些什么样的行为,00:30:39.305,00:30:42.345,"Now, it’s time for the audience to raise questions."
00:30:42.571,00:30:45.150,哈率先举手的这位来欢迎提问,00:30:42.345,00:30:45.495,"OK, that gentleman. He raised his hand first."
00:30:45.151,00:30:47.910,大家说我来提过提个问题,00:30:45.495,00:30:47.545,"Prof. Zhang, I would like to ask a question."
,,,00:30:47.545,00:30:49.920,We live in cities.
00:30:47.911,00:30:53.070,我们生活在城市里面继承这个民主选举里面也涉及的几种其中一种,00:30:49.920,00:30:52.840,There are several types of grassroots elections.
00:30:53.071,00:30:54.030,那就是很重要的,,,
00:30:54.031,00:30:57.420,就跟我们切身相关的就是业委会的正式选举,00:30:53.100,00:30:57.280,One of them of vital importance and close relation with us is the election of the house-owner committee.
00:30:57.421,00:30:58.770,像我家这个优惠了,,,
00:30:58.771,00:31:00.960,现在选择他我就觉得挺好的,00:30:57.420,00:31:00.900,"Some committees are good, like the one selected in my community,"
00:31:00.961,00:31:03.210,但是看到别的好的地方都不行,00:31:01.060,00:31:03.380,but I find some committees are not running well in many other communities.
00:31:03.211,00:31:05.490,然后就大家吵得很厉害,00:31:03.580,00:31:05.100,The house-owners are always arguing.
00:31:05.491,00:31:07.470,想问下你这方面的,00:31:05.440,00:31:07.300,I just want to ask you about this.
00:31:07.471,00:31:11.610,如果以前我们一开始有设计或者这种设想的话,00:31:07.620,00:31:10.060,Are those committees running as we expected
00:31:11.611,00:31:13.050,有没有达到这方面的效果,00:31:10.060,00:31:12.720,if we had plans on that issue?
00:31:13.051,00:31:15.000,或者现在这个你怎么评价,00:31:12.900,00:31:16.240,Or what's your comment on it?
00:31:15.001,00:31:19.470,现在现在只能线下这个在农村进行的这个基层选举,00:31:16.440,00:31:20.544,Grassroots elections in both villagers' committees of rural areas
00:31:19.471,00:31:26.280,村委会现金你挑这个城市小区业委会的神器是让面临类似的问题,00:31:20.544,00:31:24.565,"and house-owners’ committees in urban areas that you mentioned,"
00:31:26.281,00:31:28.230,就是在农村基层选举,00:31:24.565,00:31:26.480,are facing similar challenges.
00:31:28.231,00:31:30.090,我们有一些研究的,00:31:26.860,00:31:31.680,And we have done some research on the challenges in grassroot elections.
00:31:30.091,00:31:32.100,就现在面临什么挑战,,,
00:31:32.101,00:31:37.620,一个是金钱的卷入黑社会的卷入,00:31:31.800,00:31:39.980,"These challenges include the involvement of money, gangsters, and family politics."
00:31:37.621,00:31:42.750,这个家族政治卷入这在中国文化中很普遍的啊,00:31:40.180,00:31:43.005,Those problems are very common in Chinese culture.
00:31:42.751,00:31:45.270,你一个人拿这个二十张身份证啊,00:31:43.005,00:31:46.170,You can cast 20 votes times with 20 ID cards of your family
00:31:45.271,00:31:47.970,全是自己姓张的姓王的,00:31:46.170,00:31:47.940,who have the same surname as you.
00:31:47.971,00:31:49.890,就这样都选了大家无所谓啊,00:31:47.940,00:31:49.654,You can vote for whoever you like.
00:31:49.891,00:31:53.130,就这样的那么因为现在这个很多村,00:31:49.654,00:31:50.460,They don’t care.
00:31:53.131,00:31:55.680,这个涉及到的经济压力已经很大了,00:31:50.620,00:31:55.097,"The economic benefits involved in many villages are very large,"
00:31:55.681,00:31:57.990,甚至上亿甚至更多的资材了,00:31:55.097,00:31:57.940,about hundreds of millions or even more.
00:31:57.991,00:31:59.550,就是选举竞争的很厉害,00:31:57.940,00:32:00.640,So the competition of elections is very fierce in many places.
00:31:59.551,00:32:03.240,很多地方那么另外一种情况就是空心化,00:32:00.640,00:32:03.440,Another challenge is rural hollowing.
00:32:03.241,00:32:06.000,这个城市很多人都能特别年轻,00:32:03.440,00:32:07.820,"Many rural residents, especially young people, have moved to the county-level cities or bigger cities."
00:32:06.001,00:32:08.460,都到县城到大城市娶了你,,,
00:32:08.461,00:32:10.440,开个春梦园会都开不起,00:32:07.940,00:32:10.840,There’re not enough people to organize a village committee.
00:32:10.441,00:32:11.190,唉,,,
00:32:11.191,00:32:14.280,那么这个线确实是新的挑战,00:32:10.840,00:32:14.180,This is indeed a new challenge.
,,,00:32:14.180,00:32:16.470,One of the measures we are taking
00:32:14.281,00:32:20.040,那么我们现在采用的方法就是一个是重新加强党的领导,00:32:16.470,00:32:19.800,is to re-strengthen the leadership of the party.
00:32:20.041,00:32:21.330,还是要有人来组织,00:32:19.800,00:32:21.015,"Still, we need someone to organize the committees."
00:32:21.331,00:32:23.130,否则要出问题,00:32:21.015,00:32:22.435,"Otherwise, problems will arise."
00:32:23.131,00:32:23.370,那么,,,
00:32:23.371,00:32:27.990,共产党就是代表人民的整体利益做一些安排,00:32:22.800,00:32:26.980,"The Communist Party of China makes some arrangements on behalf of the overall interests of the people,"
00:32:27.991,00:32:29.190,然后我们再来取,00:32:27.060,00:32:29.900,and then we can elect the right people.
00:32:29.191,00:32:31.410,这是一个爱就是我讲的,00:32:29.900,00:32:33.158,"Also, as I said, for the existing village committees,"
00:32:31.411,00:32:34.590,对现在已经现成的这种村委会啊,00:32:33.158,00:32:36.600,we should strengthen their functions to do a better job.
00:32:34.591,00:32:43.080,这种加强的把做的更好一点掺沙子陪受过教育的一些干部下放到那去工作一段时间驻村,00:32:36.600,00:32:43.980,Appoint some educated cadres to stay in the village to work there for a period of time.
00:32:43.081,00:32:43.560,然后呢,,,
00:32:43.561,00:32:51.600,就是侧重点从选举民主出不到这个智力就讨论各家实际的问题,00:32:44.200,00:32:48.427,The focus should gradually change from election democracy to governance democracy
,,,00:32:48.427,00:32:51.140,so that they can discuss various practical problems.
00:32:51.601,00:32:53.520,就是这个更加有价值,00:32:51.240,00:32:52.920,I think this is more valuable.
00:32:53.521,00:32:57.540,那业主委员会也这个问题就是因为他现在很多确实涉及到,00:32:53.140,00:32:56.055,"It is also the same for the house-owners’ committee,"
00:32:57.541,00:33:00.870,比如说一个小区的维修基金加在一起,00:32:56.060,00:32:58.591,because it also involves the issue of
00:33:00.871,00:33:03.180,相当大一笔钱怎么使用,00:32:58.591,00:33:03.720,how to spend a large sum of money like the maintenance fund of a community.
00:33:03.181,00:33:04.710,我自己做了个研究,,,
00:33:04.711,00:33:06.270,让我走了一百多个国家,00:33:03.720,00:33:06.500,"I myself did some research when I traveled to more than 100 countries,"
00:33:06.271,00:33:08.430,我对各种民族发觉,,,
00:33:08.431,00:33:12.510,这个发现是有不同的长处和短处,00:33:06.560,00:33:11.920,and I find that various ethnic groups have different strengths and weaknesses.
00:33:12.511,00:33:16.890,你不要说就英美主要是安陆刷信誉,00:33:12.120,00:33:16.200,"For example, Britain and the United States are mainly comprised of Anglo-Saxons."
00:33:16.891,00:33:18.660,这个名字是有一个特点,,,
00:33:18.661,00:33:22.860,它的自组织自己组织自己能力相对比较强,00:33:16.240,00:33:22.007,"This ethnic group, featuring a relatively strong ability of self-organizing,"
,,,00:33:22.007,00:33:23.600,love to form a union.
00:33:22.861,00:33:26.460,而且喜欢他班有十个人到另外国家去,00:33:24.240,00:33:27.200,"For example, if ten of them meet in a foreign country,"
00:33:26.461,00:33:28.140,他碰在一起啊,,,
00:33:28.141,00:33:28.860,他就要哎,,,
00:33:28.861,00:33:29.880,我们成立个客,,,
00:33:29.881,00:33:30.870,阿成了一个俱乐部,00:33:27.480,00:33:32.820,they will set up a club and elect a president.
00:33:30.871,00:33:33.450,来选一个专制政权的主席,,,
00:33:33.451,00:33:35.010,这很适合他们的文化,00:33:32.820,00:33:35.560,This fits their culture.
00:33:35.011,00:33:38.940,在他们自己会适应规则打造的规则走但是呢,00:33:35.640,00:33:38.160,"They will make rules by themselves, and everyone follows the rules."
00:33:38.941,00:33:39.900,中国比较优势,00:33:38.165,00:33:40.785,And what is China's comparative advantage?
00:33:39.901,00:33:47.460,在什么地方也是数千年的记忆形成就是我们的考试考核,00:33:40.785,00:33:42.985,It has been evolved in our genes for thousands of years.
00:33:47.461,00:33:48.570,呵呵,00:33:43.500,00:33:49.540,"That is the exam assessment, also called selection now."
00:33:48.571,00:33:49.470,现在叫选吧,,,
00:33:50.670,00:33:53.400,就这个是中国做的比较好,00:33:49.920,00:33:52.640,This is where China does better.
00:33:53.401,00:33:56.070,就觉得大家发挥自己的比较优势,00:33:53.005,00:33:55.940,So I think we are good at taking advantage of our comparative advantages.
00:33:56.071,00:33:57.570,我们可以进各种各样的事业,00:33:55.940,00:33:59.560,We can carry out a variety of experiments and keep doing that.
00:33:58.560,00:34:05.190,继续试验总有一些适合每个地方具体的情况的最后就出来了,00:33:59.780,00:34:02.100,There must be some pilots that fit their specific conditions in some places.
00:34:05.191,00:34:06.840,但是我一个大的基本收入,00:34:02.100,00:34:04.900,And those are the results we are looking for.
00:34:06.841,00:34:08.970,恐怕中国式还是选吧,00:34:04.900,00:34:09.760,"But basically, I think it's better for China to adopt a combination of selection and election"
,,,00:34:09.760,00:34:11.860,rather than mere election.
00:34:08.971,00:34:18.030,嘉璇笔笔光是靠选举前些日子在刚果河在尼日利亚这个总统选举发生的事情,00:34:11.860,00:34:17.900,Something happened in the presidential elections in Congo and Nigeria.
00:34:18.031,00:34:20.160,要不然就是选举的选票,,,
00:34:20.161,00:34:22.410,运送选票的飞机坠毁了,00:34:18.120,00:34:23.208,"One of the cases was that the plane carrying the ballots crashed,"
00:34:24.000,00:34:24.660,两边说,,,
00:34:24.661,00:34:27.000,那这节我们要重新选吧,00:34:23.208,00:34:26.260,so the two parties decided to re-elect.
00:34:27.001,00:34:33.450,一种情况就是领导该到最终投票钱大概48小时以内说,00:34:26.760,00:34:31.202,"Another was that about 48 hours before or even closer to the voting deadline,"
,,,00:34:31.202,00:34:32.760,"the election was postponed,"
00:34:33.451,00:34:40.500,因为漂相跟基站没有办法做到确实的物质基础选我们选举推迟吧,00:34:32.760,00:34:36.940,because the ballot box and the base station weren't ready.
,,,00:34:37.120,00:34:39.640,They had no choice but to postpone the election.
00:34:40.501,00:34:43.140,结果很多人飞了几百公里或者跑了几百公里,00:34:39.940,00:34:43.420,"As a result, many people traveled hundreds of kilometers to the constituency,"
,,,00:34:43.420,00:34:44.880,only to be told that it was postponed.
00:34:43.141,00:34:46.740,到了选区发现告诉被推迟了我们只谈形式,00:34:44.940,00:34:46.680,"If we only talk about the form,"
00:34:46.741,00:34:49.380,这形势我看差不多都属于叫失败的,00:34:46.880,00:34:50.760,I think both of these are failed electoral institutions.
00:34:49.381,00:34:51.150,这种这种选举模式,,,
00:34:51.151,00:34:54.960,你这个选举模式无论是从效率还是从结果都没达到预期,00:34:50.980,00:34:54.920,Such kind of election failed to meet expectations in terms of efficiency and results.
00:34:54.961,00:34:56.250,我后面还有朋友,00:34:55.000,00:34:58.100,Are there any questions from the audience behind? Raise your hand please.
00:34:56.251,00:35:00.510,要提问的有没有去收拾好来欢迎这位张教授,00:34:58.100,00:34:59.500,This gentleman please.
00:35:00.511,00:35:01.680,您好,,,
00:35:01.681,00:35:03.540,我这个问题是这样的,00:34:59.720,00:35:07.220,"Hello Prof. Zhang, I have a question for you."
00:35:03.541,00:35:07.830,就是我本人可能比较喜欢平常看一些历史,00:35:07.460,00:35:09.682,I love reading history books in daily life.
00:35:07.831,00:35:12.810,我觉得中国历史上至少在多党制上是有很深的传统的,00:35:09.682,00:35:12.680,I think China has a long tradition of multi-party systems.
00:35:12.811,00:35:14.490,从东汉开始,,,
00:35:14.491,00:35:14.790,对吧,00:35:13.040,00:35:15.980,"From the Eastern Han Dynasty, relatives in maternal line and eunuchs kept jostling for power."
00:35:14.791,00:35:17.520,外企和那换就开始,,,
00:35:17.521,00:35:20.100,其实就是党争的初始阶段嘛,00:35:15.980,00:35:20.100,That was actually the initial stage of the party conflicts.
00:35:20.101,00:35:21.570,然后到唐朝,00:35:20.220,00:35:22.880,"Later in the Tang Dynasty, the Niu-Faction and Li-Faction contended for power."
00:35:21.571,00:35:24.240,牛李党争到北宋新旧党,00:35:22.920,00:35:25.280,"Such things happened between the reformative party and conservative party in the Northern Song Dynasty,"
00:35:24.241,00:35:28.500,争到明朝东林党和阉党的党争基本上,00:35:25.460,00:35:28.100,and the Donglin Faction and Eunuch Faction in the Ming Dynasty.
00:35:28.501,00:35:33.060,这些党政都导致了国家最后的巨大的损失和灭亡,00:35:28.200,00:35:33.080,"Basically, these party conflicts all led to huge losses and perish of the dynasty."
,,,00:35:33.260,00:35:37.980,"So in our way of developing such a new democratic system suitable for China,"
00:35:33.061,00:35:44.130,那我们在中国在建立这种全新的这种向张教授您说的这个选拔加选举的这种适合中国的民主制度的时候,00:35:38.040,00:35:42.940,"like the one combining selection and election as you mentioned,"
00:35:44.131,00:35:46.140,又该如何去避免我们,00:35:43.020,00:35:48.820,how could we avoid the problems that have occurred in our history?
00:35:46.141,00:35:49.050,中国历史上曾经出现过的这些问题,,,
00:35:49.051,00:35:49.860,实际上过,,,
00:35:49.861,00:35:52.410,你真的看我们的传统政治的话,00:35:48.820,00:35:51.700,"If you really know well about our traditional politics,"
00:35:52.411,00:35:55.650,大家在中国传统政治文化中,00:35:52.100,00:35:58.740,"in fact, expressions like party conflicts and clique politics convey a derogatory sense."
00:35:55.651,00:35:59.280,党争朋党政治等等都是变异的,,,
00:35:59.281,00:36:01.650,就我们想有过这样的教训,00:35:58.840,00:36:01.435,We actually learned a lesson from that.
00:36:01.651,00:36:06.870,当我们那时候你可以说是一种传统的政治构架,00:36:01.440,00:36:06.560,"Of course, we can define it as a traditional political framework at that time,"
00:36:06.871,00:36:10.740,不是现代所为党政机关政党制度,00:36:06.560,00:36:10.460,instead of the current so-called party conflicts or political party system.
00:36:10.741,00:36:15.090,但是民国是真的尝试了美式民主,00:36:10.580,00:36:14.620,"But during the Republican period, we tried American-style democracy indeed,"
00:36:15.091,00:36:17.280,这一下子就有三百多个字,00:36:14.720,00:36:17.325,and more than 300 political parties mushroomed.
00:36:17.281,00:36:18.840,现在很多的研究,,,
00:36:18.841,00:36:21.390,你可以去看起他们一个一个作业,00:36:17.325,00:36:21.039,You can research into those parties one by one
00:36:21.391,00:36:27.840,没有从一个都没有真正为多数老百姓做事情的真的,00:36:21.040,00:36:27.280,and you’ll find that none of these parties behaved for the interests of the people.
00:36:27.841,00:36:33.390,我们传统也不允许不分离盆挡着你也是不分灵异档案,00:36:27.740,00:36:32.792,"Also, our tradition does not allow the existence of parties for partial interests"
,,,00:36:32.792,00:36:35.100,including parties of clique politics.
00:36:33.391,00:36:38.520,这个因为我的基本的道理就是中国是个文明行为,00:36:35.220,00:36:38.836,"All my views are based on that China is a civilizational state,"
00:36:38.521,00:36:43.290,成百上千国家慢慢整合地域概念非常之强,00:36:38.836,00:36:40.960,an integration of hundreds of states.
,,,00:36:40.960,00:36:43.360,Chinese people have a strong feeling for their own regions.
00:36:44.250,00:36:48.870,不要说中国你看我们的邻国韩国一直注意他那个选取,00:36:43.440,00:36:46.720,"Leaving aside China, just pay attention to our neighbor, South Korea."
00:36:48.871,00:36:49.590,哎,00:36:46.720,00:36:49.120,Pay attention to its election.
00:36:49.591,00:36:49.740,哎,,,
00:36:49.741,00:36:49.950,当然,,,
00:36:49.951,00:36:54.780,他们现在韩国总统是最危险的职业,00:36:49.220,00:36:52.960,The presidency is the most dangerous position in Korea.
00:36:54.781,00:36:56.010,大家都知道了,00:36:53.100,00:36:55.700,(laughs) Most of us know this.
00:36:56.011,00:36:59.850,他那个选民结构基本上都是本地,00:36:55.700,00:36:59.577,"Its electoral districts are basically in accordance with ""Do"","
00:36:59.851,00:37:00.870,我是这个道具,00:36:59.577,00:37:01.640,"which equals ""province"" in China."
00:37:00.871,00:37:05.670,箱内我们是我就选我们这个时代最大的改中文稿,00:37:01.740,00:37:04.780,"People will only vote for candidates from their own province, on most occasions."
00:37:05.671,00:37:07.410,他也地狱干得非常近,00:37:05.040,00:37:08.380,Chinese people also share this kind of mindset.
00:37:07.411,00:37:10.560,我江苏人就选加入三星就像山西,00:37:08.580,00:37:11.058,"Similarly, people vote for candidates from their province."
00:37:10.561,00:37:12.390,这是个大概率事件,00:37:11.058,00:37:12.340,It’s a high probability event.
00:37:12.391,00:37:13.950,所以中国我们不能这样子,00:37:12.500,00:37:14.560,So elections can't be held like that in China.
00:37:13.951,00:37:16.350,我们已超出这个阶段,00:37:14.760,00:37:15.980,We have left this way behind.
00:37:16.351,00:37:21.030,好在就是当我们这个探索还在继续进行之中,00:37:16.200,00:37:19.262,"Of course, we are still exploring"
00:37:21.031,00:37:23.130,我们还有自己的问题,00:37:19.262,00:37:22.880,because we still have our own problems.
00:37:23.131,00:37:24.660,怎么能把它做的更好,00:37:22.880,00:37:24.220,We keep looking for a solution to improve the way of election.
00:37:24.661,00:37:25.830,但是这点共识,,,
00:37:25.831,00:37:27.720,我今天多数人都有了,00:37:24.240,00:37:27.880,"At least, one consensus that most people have is that"
00:37:27.721,00:37:31.530,就是一定要有一个整体利益,00:37:27.880,00:37:30.593,"there must be a party for overall interests,"
00:37:31.531,00:37:35.760,而不是一个一个的部分利益的中国才有希望,00:37:30.593,00:37:33.860,instead of a number of parties for partial interests.
00:37:35.761,00:37:37.440,否则就完蛋了,00:37:33.860,00:37:36.720,"Only in this way can China have a promising future, or we'll fail."
00:37:37.441,00:37:41.460,这也是我们现在一些工资他最不习惯,00:37:36.880,00:37:41.220,This is a view that some public intellectuals can hardly accept.
00:37:41.461,00:37:45.540,所以他看到甚至连一谈到这个集体主义也好,00:37:41.220,00:37:43.576,"When people talk about collectivism,"
00:37:45.541,00:37:47.640,难道是众志成城克服困难,00:37:43.576,00:37:46.520,"the spirit of unity to overcome difficulties,"
00:37:47.641,00:37:51.450,像这个流浪地球只有精神以体现出来,00:37:46.680,00:37:51.080,"or things like ""The Wandering Earth"","
00:37:51.451,00:37:55.650,他都觉得不能适应谁叫这是中国的优势,00:37:51.260,00:37:53.540,they find it hard to accustom themselves to the spirit in them.
,,,00:37:53.740,00:37:56.200,"But actually, this is China's advantage."
00:37:55.651,00:37:57.510,我们是整体利益的,00:37:56.380,00:37:57.960,We have a party for overall interest.
00:37:57.511,00:38:00.570,现在就是中国共产党保持先进性,00:37:57.960,00:37:59.540,That is the Communist Party of China.
00:38:00.571,00:38:02.730,真的能够代表人民的身体,00:37:59.540,00:38:01.128,"They should maintain its advanced nature,"
00:38:02.731,00:38:04.980,而不能代表少数人,00:38:01.128,00:38:04.380,and keep representing the overall interests of Chinese people instead of a minority.
,,,00:38:04.740,00:38:08.720,So I say that the biggest difference between Chinese politics and American politics is that
00:38:04.981,00:38:12.720,所以我讲中国美国政治最大的不同就是我们最富的一百个人不可能左右中共不要进去,00:38:08.800,00:38:12.060,"the 100 richest people in our country cannot control the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,"
00:38:12.721,00:38:15.750,而美国最富的一百个人甚至五十人就可以左右,00:38:12.400,00:38:17.580,while the 100 richest people in the United States or even 50 people can control the White House.
00:38:15.751,00:38:17.220,白宫最大的区,,,
00:38:18.240,00:38:20.160,好我们接下来继续提问,00:38:17.860,00:38:20.940,Let's keep the questions going. Anyone else?
00:38:20.161,00:38:20.820,还有没有,,,
00:38:21.960,00:38:23.190,来欢迎这位朋友,00:38:21.560,00:38:22.800,"This lady, please."
00:38:23.191,00:38:24.390,我们话筒传递一下,00:38:22.800,00:38:24.760,"Pass her the microphone, please. Thanks."
00:38:24.391,00:38:25.290,谢谢啊,,,
00:38:25.291,00:38:26.820,郑先生你好啊,00:38:24.760,00:38:26.400,"Hello, Prof. Zhang."
00:38:26.821,00:38:28.950,就是在征集民意的过程中呢,00:38:26.400,00:38:29.583,"In the process of collecting people's opinions,"
00:38:28.951,00:38:33.330,额我发现群众的意见会很分散,00:38:29.583,00:38:32.360,I found that the opinions were unfocused.
00:38:33.331,00:38:36.120,因此就会觉得发明主没有效率,00:38:32.360,00:38:35.565,so I think that democracy is inefficient.
00:38:36.121,00:38:37.740,最终还是由领导来决定,00:38:35.565,00:38:37.965,And it is up to the leaders to decide in the end.
00:38:37.741,00:38:43.200,那不同的领导班子有对民主集中制有着不同的理解和操作,00:38:37.965,00:38:42.320,Different leading groups have different understandings of democratic centralism and different ways to practice.
00:38:43.201,00:38:46.470,这样的话就是民主集中制能否得到实现,00:38:42.660,00:38:46.086,"In this case, whether democratic centralism can be achieved"
00:38:46.471,00:38:50.490,可能会过分依赖于一把手的素质和能力,00:38:46.086,00:38:49.860,may be overly dependent on the quality and ability of the leader.
00:38:50.491,00:38:50.940,那么,,,
00:38:50.941,00:38:54.840,你是如何看待这种民主被虚置的问题呢,00:38:50.160,00:38:53.600,"So what do you think of this issue that democracy is put ""on the shelf""?"
00:38:54.841,00:38:56.490,谢谢,00:38:53.600,00:38:55.120,Thank you.
00:38:56.491,00:38:58.830,不同观点可以互相讨论辩论,00:38:55.980,00:38:59.000,Different opinions can be discussed and debated.
,,,00:39:00.220,00:39:02.320,We are not afraid of competitions at all.
00:39:00.510,00:39:06.960,我们一点都不害怕竞争中国人你要自信就是中国青,00:39:02.700,00:39:04.280,"China, be confident."
00:39:06.961,00:39:07.920,张维维说,00:39:04.860,00:39:06.860,"China now with Zhang Weiwei.

00:39:11.070,00:39:11.970,在微观层面,00:39:10.780,00:39:13.240,"At the micro-level, I agree with you."
00:39:11.971,00:39:15.720,我同意你的就是确实是千差万别,00:39:13.240,00:39:14.780,Conditions vary greatly in different places.
00:39:15.721,00:39:16.560,到每个单位,,,
00:39:16.561,00:39:20.190,他可能这个民主集中做的好还是不好的,00:39:15.360,00:39:18.740,Democratic centralism is implemented differently.
00:39:20.191,00:39:21.450,水平差差远去了,00:39:18.880,00:39:21.820,It varies greatly in different organizations.
00:39:22.470,00:39:25.170,那么现在我看中国的解决办法,00:39:22.360,00:39:25.400,One of the solutions in our country is that
00:39:25.171,00:39:30.150,其中之一就是一个是中组部在陪干不起要特别考虑,00:39:25.620,00:39:28.970,The Organization Department of the Central Committee of the CPC
00:39:30.151,00:39:32.040,比如说你是一个大学,00:39:28.970,00:39:32.000,would assign different cadres to different organizations.
00:39:32.041,00:39:34.950,你是个什么企业国企,00:39:32.240,00:39:37.200,"Universities, state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises should have different calibers of personnel."
00:39:34.951,00:39:37.770,那么最好找到比较合适的匹配,,,
00:39:37.771,00:39:38.910,导致也不太容易,00:39:37.680,00:39:40.625,"It's not easy, though, we are trying our best."
00:39:38.911,00:39:42.360,但是尽量在做还一个就是先通过形式,00:39:40.625,00:39:42.179,Another solution is to rely on inspections.
00:39:42.361,00:39:44.070,因为现在是两种情况,00:39:42.180,00:39:45.920,Two problems are found very common in this process.
00:39:44.071,00:39:51.630,就是不喜欢民主集中制的一种就是张横跋扈就一个人全都我报了啊,00:39:46.140,00:39:48.440,One is that some officials are imperious and despotic.
00:39:51.631,00:39:54.120,我说什么就是什么不民主,00:39:48.940,00:39:53.400,"The head decides everything, making the system undemocratic."
00:39:54.121,00:39:57.330,海总就是懒政山真不错,00:39:53.720,00:39:56.620,And the other is that they are lazy and unwilling to work.
00:39:57.331,00:40:00.600,那么巡视中这两个都是要注意的问题,00:39:56.915,00:40:00.035,These two issues should be paid attention to during the inspection.
00:40:00.601,00:40:03.720,如果你们这个单位这个领导要么是懒政,00:40:00.280,00:40:02.594,"If your leader is lazy or arbitrary,"
00:40:03.721,00:40:05.550,要不是不搞民主集中制,,,
00:40:05.551,00:40:07.020,你可以直接性交意见啊,00:40:02.594,00:40:09.020,you can directly call the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on their cellphones. (laughs）
00:40:07.021,00:40:11.250,直接冲到中纪委手机这个宏观层面,00:40:09.220,00:40:12.455,"At the macro level, we have done a good job overall."
00:40:11.251,00:40:12.780,从前我们做的不错,,,
00:40:12.781,00:40:13.110,哎呦,,,
00:40:13.111,00:40:16.710,最经典案例就是五年计划,00:40:12.460,00:40:16.220,The five-year plan is a typical case.
00:40:16.711,00:40:20.820,中国这个四年的崛起或者七年崛起前三年,00:40:16.360,00:40:19.800,"Although we encountered more setbacks in the first 30 years,"
00:40:20.821,00:40:22.710,当我们碰到挫折多一点,00:40:19.825,00:40:22.565,I would attribute the rise of China in the past 70 years or the latest 40 years
00:40:22.711,00:40:25.680,但总体上是无名计划一个一个的气息,00:40:22.565,00:40:25.275,"to the successful implementation of five-year plans,"
00:40:25.681,00:40:28.290,特别是过去事情进行得相当之好,00:40:25.275,00:40:27.905,especially in the latest 40 years.
00:40:28.291,00:40:35.430,我倒是同意就是中国模式中实际上一把手的作用非常之重要,00:40:27.905,00:40:34.160,"I agree that in the China model, the role of the top leader is very important,"
00:40:35.431,00:40:38.790,所以我们反复强调治国要靠人才,00:40:34.520,00:40:38.260,so we have repeatedly stressed that governing the country depends on talents.
00:40:38.791,00:40:40.980,上次是个普遍真理,00:40:38.400,00:40:40.620,"In fact, this is a universal truth."
00:40:40.981,00:40:42.240,一个公司的成功,00:40:40.620,00:40:43.059,A company's success is the same.
00:40:42.241,00:40:46.890,阿里巴巴没有马云就没有阿里巴巴公司治理是一个道理的,00:40:43.059,00:40:46.260,There would not be Alibaba without Ma Yun.
00:40:46.891,00:40:49.200,能在中国的模式尤其如此,00:40:46.880,00:40:49.427,"This is especially true in the China model,"
00:40:49.201,00:40:54.660,那是中国该向四周年可以看得出来的不同观点,00:40:49.427,00:40:53.040,which can be proven in the 40 years of reform and opening up.
00:40:54.661,00:40:56.370,可以互相讨论辩论,00:40:54.040,00:40:56.700,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:40:58.770,00:41:00.960,中国向全世界输出最多的游客,00:40:58.900,00:41:00.840,China is the largest tourist exporting country.
00:41:00.961,00:41:02.670,他们为什么回到一个着,00:41:00.840,00:41:02.727,Why do they still go back to a country
00:41:02.671,00:41:05.100,你们讲师没有人权,00:41:02.727,00:41:05.060,that you called a country without human rights?
00:41:05.101,00:41:07.800,美国每年发布一个世界人权观察报告,00:41:05.100,00:41:08.643,The US publishes a report on the observation on worldwide human rights every year.
00:41:07.801,00:41:10.530,就是您怎么看他的这个报告,00:41:08.643,00:41:09.940,What do you think of that?
00:41:10.531,00:41:13.350,您觉得中国式的女权应该是怎样的,00:41:10.120,00:41:13.055,What should be Chinese Feminism like in your opinion?
00:41:13.351,00:41:18.090,你谈这个人群特别中国的裤子乃至任何一家人群,00:41:13.060,00:41:18.060,"When you want to talk about human rights, human rights in China or any other countries,"
00:41:18.091,00:41:21.210,你首先要问这个国家的人,00:41:18.060,00:41:20.500,you should ask the people in that country first.
00:41:21.211,00:41:24.180,这就是中国青张尾数,00:41:20.845,00:41:23.755,"Translators: The Magpie Bridge Brigade 鹊桥小队翻译组
