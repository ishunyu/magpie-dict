00:00:02.720,00:00:05.440,我记得当年台湾刚开始,00:00:02.720,00:00:07.120,I remember when Taiwan started the so-called Democratization process
00:00:05.440,00:00:07.120,所谓民主转型的时候,,,
00:00:07.120,00:00:08.840,美国不少的政治人物,,,
00:00:08.880,00:00:10.240,都说台湾民主,00:00:07.120,00:00:12.820,"Many American politicians said that Taiwan’s democracy
would be a beacon for mainland China."
00:00:10.240,00:00:10.800,能够成为,,,
00:00:10.800,00:00:12.840,照亮中国大陆的灯塔,,,
00:00:13.200,00:00:14.280,所谓的,,,
00:00:14.400,00:00:16.680,口口声声台湾讲的民主,00:00:13.200,00:00:16.200,"Compared to what they keep claiming,
the thing they do not tell you is"
00:00:16.760,00:00:17.880,他都不告诉你,00:00:16.200,00:00:19.520,the so-called Taiwan style democracy can be manipulated.
00:00:17.880,00:00:19.680,民主是可以操控与,,,
00:00:19.720,00:00:21.800,与台独势力相比,,,
00:00:21.800,00:00:22.880,港独势力有,00:00:19.720,00:00:23.940,What is the difference between the Taiwan separatists and the Hong Kong separatists?
00:00:22.920,00:00:23.760,相同点和,,,
00:00:24.080,00:00:25.680,这就是中国,,,

a local leader election in 2020."
00:00:41.840,00:00:44.200,即将展开地区领导人的选举,,,
00:00:44.200,00:00:46.080,那么对于台湾岛内的政治生态,,,

00:01:09.400,00:01:10.080,黄老师,,,
00:01:10.080,00:01:14.200,是台湾的一个知名的媒体人,00:01:07.320,00:01:14.200,So as we all know that Ms. Huang is a well-known media personality in Taiwan
00:01:14.440,00:01:17.360,支持祖国统一支持一国两制,00:01:14.440,00:01:17.360,"She supports the unification of our country,
and the ‘one country two systems’ principle."
00:01:17.560,00:01:19.080,10月1号国庆节时候,00:01:17.560,00:01:20.360,"On Oct 1st, She was at Tiananmen Square
to attend the National Day ceremony."
00:01:19.080,00:01:20.360,他还在天安门,,,
00:01:20.360,00:01:22.400,我看着记者对他采访,00:01:20.600,00:01:22.520,I saw an interview of her.

00:01:34.520,00:01:38.200,从环境中能够发出这样非常重要,00:01:36.160,00:01:39.020,"your voice is very precious and
 important in such an environment."
00:01:38.200,00:01:38.360,的,,,

00:01:46.600,00:01:47.920,谢谢主持人,,,
00:01:48.080,00:01:49.800,真得很荣幸能够来到,00:01:45.320,00:01:51.240,"Thank you, Prof. Zhang, and thanks to the host.
It is an honor to come to China Now."
00:01:49.840,00:01:51.240,这就是中国,,,
00:01:51.400,00:01:52.760,每次我都要讲我,,,
00:01:52.800,00:01:53.400,是台湾人,00:01:51.400,00:01:55.240,"Every time, I say I am Taiwanese, so of course, I am Chinese."
00:01:53.440,00:01:54.160,所以我当然,,,
00:01:54.400,00:01:55.240,中国人,,,
00:01:55.800,00:01:56.480,但是,,,
00:01:56.920,00:01:58.320,讲这样一句话,,,
00:01:58.360,00:01:59.680,在台湾,00:01:55.800,00:02:02.360,"But if you say such a thing in Taiwan, you will be treated as insane."
00:02:00.280,00:02:02.360,当然就被当成是神经病,,,
00:02:02.720,00:02:03.960,然后你每一天,,,
00:02:03.960,00:02:04.400,你都觉得,,,
00:02:04.400,00:02:05.280,你好像活在,00:02:02.700,00:02:07.240,"Then every day you feel the pressure
as if you are living a life as a spy."
00:02:05.320,00:02:06.480,敌后工作的,,,
00:02:06.560,00:02:07.360,太下,,,
00:02:07.840,00:02:10.600,为什么在一个号称是自由,00:02:07.680,00:02:13.402,"The question is, why are you not allowed
to live an ordinary human life"
00:02:10.600,00:02:13.320,号称有人权的一个地方,,,
00:02:13.720,00:02:14.240,终究,,,
00:02:14.520,00:02:15.040,你不,,,
00:02:15.080,00:02:16.440,被容许,00:02:13.402,00:02:18.560,in a place claiming to be free and to have human rights?
00:02:16.960,00:02:18.560,活得像一个人,,,
00:02:19.200,00:02:20.480,这就是我今天想要讨论的,00:02:19.200,00:02:21.340,This is what I want to discuss today.
00:02:20.520,00:02:20.960,的,,,
00:02:21.360,00:02:22.080,站在一个,,,
00:02:22.080,00:02:24.360,这就是中国人的一个立场,,,
00:02:24.360,00:02:25.880,我们回头过来看看,00:02:21.340,00:02:27.620,"From the perspective a Chinese national, I will review what Taiwan has gone through,"
00:02:25.920,00:02:27.640,台湾曾经走了怎么样的路,,,
00:02:27.640,00:02:29.280,然后怎么会走到今天,,,
00:02:30.240,00:02:32.440,未来应该怎么办,00:02:27.640,00:02:32.440,"And how did Taiwan become what it is today,
and what should Taiwan do in the future?"
00:02:32.560,00:02:32.960,是,00:02:32.440,00:02:33.320,Right.
00:02:32.960,00:02:34.920,所以今天我们将会在节目里面,,,
00:02:34.960,00:02:36.840,深度的来解读台湾,00:02:33.480,00:02:36.780,"So today, we will have an in-depth interpretation of Taiwan."
00:02:36.920,00:02:38.920,首先我们会请张教授,00:02:36.920,00:02:40.040,"Firstly, Prof. Zhang will give a speech,"
00:02:38.920,00:02:40.040,先给出一段演讲,,,
00:02:40.040,00:02:41.320,然后再请黄志杰女士,00:02:40.040,00:02:42.440,"then Ms. Huang will also give a speech,"
00:02:41.320,00:02:42.840,也给出一段演讲之后,,,
00:02:42.840,00:02:44.680,我们会开放现场互动讨论,00:02:42.460,00:02:44.700,"In the end, we will open the floor for questions and discussion."
00:02:44.680,00:02:46.240,首先把时间交给章教授,00:02:44.700,00:02:46.740,"Now, I will give the stage to Professor Zhang."
00:02:52.440,00:02:54.000,那么2016年,,,
00:02:54.080,00:02:56.200,我曾经在东南卫视,00:02:52.440,00:02:57.640,I gave a speech at Southeast Television in 2016.
00:02:56.200,00:02:57.640,做过一个演讲,,,
00:02:57.720,00:02:59.600,那么演讲结束的时候,00:02:57.720,00:03:01.880,I gave an example at the end of that speech.
00:03:00.000,00:03:01.280,我用了一个例子,,,
00:03:01.280,00:03:02.200,我就说,,,
00:03:02.600,00:03:05.040,当时我是比较大陆基础设施的,,,
00:03:05.040,00:03:06.120,飞速发展,00:03:02.600,00:03:07.760,I compared the rapid development of infrastructure in the Mainland and the situation in Taiwan.
00:03:06.120,00:03:07.760,和台湾的情况,,,
00:03:08.000,00:03:09.640,那么我比较两岸,,,
00:03:09.720,00:03:10.040,采用,,,
00:03:10.080,00:03:11.760,不同的政治制度产生,00:03:08.000,00:03:14.800,The measure is the performance gap caused by the different political systems across the strait.
00:03:11.760,00:03:14.800,我叫做制度绩效的落差,,,
00:03:14.800,00:03:15.960,我当时这样讲的,00:03:14.800,00:03:15.960,"I said,"
00:03:15.960,00:03:17.680,我说我第1次去台湾访问,00:03:15.960,00:03:19.000,It was 1996 when I first visit Taiwan.
00:03:17.680,00:03:19.000,是1996年,,,
00:03:19.240,00:03:20.880,那么当时台湾就决定,,,
00:03:20.920,00:03:22.200,要建一条地铁,00:03:19.240,00:03:23.720,"They decided to build a subway,
known as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in Taiwan."
00:03:22.200,00:03:23.720,在台湾叫捷运,,,
00:03:23.960,00:03:26.520,从台北市中心到桃园机场,00:03:23.960,00:03:28.220,The full length is 51 km from Central Taipei to Taoyuan International Airport.
00:03:26.640,00:03:28.240,一共是51公里,,,
00:03:28.440,00:03:30.880,但20年过去还没有建成,00:03:28.440,00:03:30.880,"But 20 years passed, and it was still not completed."
00:03:31.160,00:03:33.560,这个期间换了13个交通部长,00:03:31.160,00:03:33.560,"During this period, they had 13 Ministers of Transportation."
00:03:33.560,00:03:34.920,大都是政治任命,,,
00:03:34.960,00:03:36.560,不是真正干事业,00:03:33.560,00:03:36.560,"Most of them were appointed for political reasons, but not for doing real business."
00:03:37.200,00:03:38.560,玩过去这20年间,,,
00:03:38.560,00:03:40.200,中国大陆发生了什么,00:03:37.200,00:03:40.200,But what happened in Mainland China in those 20 years?
00:03:40.200,00:03:41.400,中国大陆修建了,,,
00:03:41.400,00:03:43.680,世界最大的高速公路网,00:03:40.200,00:03:43.700,"Mainland China built the largest national highway network,"
00:03:43.680,00:03:46.000,世界最大最好的高铁网,00:03:43.700,00:03:46.000,and also the largest and best high-speed train network
00:03:46.040,00:03:47.600,所以能建地铁的城市,00:03:46.040,00:03:48.880,All the cities that meet the conditions have built subways.
00:03:47.600,00:03:48.880,都在建地铁,,,
00:03:49.080,00:03:50.440,上海从零开始,,,
00:03:50.440,00:03:51.400,已经修建了,,,
00:03:51.400,00:03:53.880,世界最长的城市地铁线,00:03:49.080,00:03:53.880,Shanghai has built the world's longest metro mileage from zero.
00:03:54.040,00:03:55.080,所以当时我这样说的,00:03:54.040,00:03:55.080,So this is what I said:
00:03:55.120,00:03:57.880,我说在制度绩效的反差,00:03:55.120,00:04:00.040,"With such an obvious gap between the performance of two political systems,"
00:03:57.920,00:04:00.040,如此巨大的情况下,,,
00:04:00.200,00:04:02.600,我们有些人还是认为,,,
00:04:02.600,00:04:05.920,台湾制度代表中华民族的未来,00:04:00.200,00:04:06.040,some of us still believed that the Taiwan system represented the future of China.
00:04:06.040,00:04:08.360,我说这叫做严重的脑残,00:04:06.040,00:04:08.140,"I said, ""They must've had some brain damage"""
00:04:08.360,00:04:10.960,或者叫是严重的脑子进水,00:04:08.360,00:04:10.960,“or their heads are filled with water.”
00:04:10.960,00:04:13.160,缺少起码的实事求是,00:04:10.960,00:04:13.160,At least they were unable to see the truth from simple facts.
00:04:13.680,00:04:14.760,我当时讲这番话,,,
00:04:14.840,00:04:16.160,本来是针对我们国内,00:04:13.720,00:04:18.080,"I was targeting the ""leading"" public intellectuals
when I said this."
00:04:16.160,00:04:18.080,那些带路党工资的,,,
00:04:18.200,00:04:20.680,没想到这话传到了台湾一石,00:04:18.200,00:04:22.080,"I didn't expect my words to spread to Taiwan like
""tossing a stone that creates thousands of waves""."
00:04:20.680,00:04:22.080,激起千层浪,,,
00:04:22.280,00:04:23.680,台湾的中国时报,,,
00:04:23.680,00:04:25.360,那年12月7号,00:04:22.280,00:04:26.800,"On December 7th that year, Taiwan's
China Times published an editorial."
00:04:25.400,00:04:26.800,发了一篇社论,,,
00:04:27.080,00:04:28.240,它的标题是,,,
00:04:28.400,00:04:29.240,台湾民主,00:04:27.080,00:04:31.040,The title is ’Is There Any Institutional Advantage in Taiwan Democracy?‘
00:04:29.240,00:04:31.040,还有制度优势吗,,,
00:04:31.640,00:04:32.360,社论引用了,,,
00:04:32.400,00:04:33.880,我刚才讲的那段话,00:04:31.640,00:04:33.880,The editorial quoted what I said.
00:04:33.880,00:04:37.880,然后说台湾20多年来的民主化,00:04:33.880,00:04:37.980,It says some mainland intellectuals believes that
00:04:37.960,00:04:40.400,在部分大陆知识分子看来,00:04:37.980,00:04:42.780,"the past 20 years of democratization in Taiwan not only failed to be a good reference for the mainland,"
00:04:40.400,00:04:41.680,不仅不是大陆,,,
00:04:41.720,00:04:42.160,未来,,,
00:04:42.160,00:04:43.880,需要参考的模式,,,
00:04:43.920,00:04:46.360,甚至根本还是负面的教材,00:04:42.780,00:04:46.360,but also a lesson taught with a negative example.
00:04:46.840,00:04:47.880,文章还这样说,,,
00:04:47.880,00:04:50.320,张委委并不是第1次这样评论,00:04:46.840,00:04:51.080,The article also says: It is not the first time for Zhang Weiwei to comment on Taiwan like this.
00:04:50.320,00:04:51.040,台湾,,,
00:04:51.040,00:04:52.960,前年也就2014年,00:04:51.080,00:04:53.140,"Two years ago, in 2014,"
00:04:53.520,00:04:56.760,台湾太阳花学运落幕的时候,00:04:53.520,00:04:56.760,"When the Taiwan Sunflower Student Movement ended,"
00:04:56.760,00:04:59.000,他曾经在大陆凤凰卫视,00:04:56.760,00:05:00.960,he gave a speech on the Taiwan Democracy's problems on Phoenix Television
00:04:59.120,00:05:00.640,世纪大讲堂中,,,
00:05:00.720,00:05:03.000,以从希望到失望为标题,,,
00:05:03.000,00:05:06.120,谈了台湾的民主问题,00:05:00.960,00:05:05.240,with the title: From Hope to Disappointment.
00:05:06.440,00:05:08.360,实际上社论作者可能不知道,00:05:06.440,00:05:08.440,The author may not know that
00:05:08.400,00:05:11.360,我在很多场合很多次的讲过,00:05:08.440,00:05:11.360,I mentioned this several times on many occasions:
00:05:11.400,00:05:13.560,如果没有中国大陆的帮助的话,00:05:11.400,00:05:13.840,Without help from mainland China
00:05:13.600,00:05:17.040,台湾民主将不仅是从希望走向,00:05:13.840,00:05:19.240,Taiwan democracy will fall from hope to not only disappointment but also desperation.
00:05:17.040,00:05:17.520,失望,,,
00:05:17.520,00:05:19.240,而且从希望走向绝望,,,
00:05:19.640,00:05:20.880,因为大陆这个模式,,,
00:05:20.960,00:05:22.600,是大陆经济腾飞,00:05:19.640,00:05:22.600,Mainland China's model enables the mainland's economy to take off.
00:05:22.600,00:05:25.080,给台湾带来了大量的发展机遇,00:05:22.600,00:05:25.080,It also brings numerous developmental opportunities for Taiwan.
00:05:25.240,00:05:26.880,那么大陆出于同胞情,,,
00:05:26.880,00:05:28.160,愿意与台湾同胞,00:05:25.240,00:05:29.520,Then the mainland is willing to share these opportunities with our compatriots in Taiwan.
00:05:28.160,00:05:29.520,分享这些机遇,,,
00:05:30.360,00:05:31.360,这篇社论很有意思,,,
00:05:31.360,00:05:32.520,他接着这样说,00:05:30.360,00:05:32.680,This interesting editorial goes on to says:
00:05:33.040,00:05:36.720,从这个节目的高收视率来看,00:05:33.040,00:05:36.720,"Based on the high rating of this show [on Phonix TV],"
00:05:36.840,00:05:39.520,大陆为数不少的精英阶层,00:05:36.840,00:05:41.620,a large number of elites in mainland China has gradually turned their impression of Taiwan from
00:05:39.520,00:05:41.240,对台湾的印象,,,
00:05:41.440,00:05:43.160,已经逐渐从昔日的,,,
00:05:43.160,00:05:44.640,台湾最美的风景,00:05:41.620,00:05:46.880,"""people are the most beautiful scenery in Taiwan"""
00:05:44.640,00:05:46.880,是人这种浪漫情怀,,,
00:05:47.040,00:05:48.600,逐步转到今天,,,
00:05:48.640,00:05:49.400,这个叫做一个,,,
00:05:49.400,00:05:51.760,比大陆落后的负面示范,00:05:47.040,00:05:51.760,"to ""a demonstration of falling behind the mainland""."
00:05:52.560,00:05:53.240,换言之,,,
00:05:53.320,00:05:55.200,他说不少台湾人过往,00:05:52.560,00:05:57.800,"In other words, the Democratic achievements
that Taiwanese were proud of"
00:05:55.200,00:05:57.800,感到相当自豪的民主成就,,,
00:05:57.960,00:06:00.520,在两岸互动交流的20多年来,00:05:57.960,00:06:03.160,is not attractive to the people over the past 20 years of cross-strait interactions.
00:06:00.680,00:06:03.160,并没有让对岸感到心向往之,,,
00:06:03.160,00:06:06.440,反而是避之唯恐不及,00:06:03.320,00:06:06.600,"Instead, they are avoiding it out of fear."
00:06:06.880,00:06:08.880,而且持这种看法的,00:06:06.880,00:06:10.560,And many of those who hold this view are intellectuals.
00:06:08.880,00:06:10.560,很多还是知识分子,,,
00:06:11.320,00:06:13.360,我们也得扪心自问,,,
00:06:13.400,00:06:15.200,台湾的民主是泛指,00:06:11.320,00:06:16.760,"We should also ask ourselves, is Taiwan’s example of democracy really worthy of pride?"
00:06:15.200,00:06:16.760,真的值得骄傲吗,,,
00:06:17.120,00:06:17.880,没错,,,
00:06:17.880,00:06:20.560,台湾经历了三次政党轮替,00:06:17.120,00:06:20.960,It is true that Taiwan has experienced political party alternations for three times
00:06:20.560,00:06:23.120,但却是一次撕裂,00:06:20.960,00:06:24.520,"However, time and again, it creates more serious social cleavages each time."
00:06:23.160,00:06:24.520,比一次严重,,,
00:06:24.920,00:06:26.960,而且自今年所经历的政党,00:06:24.920,00:06:28.640,"I am afraid that after this year's party alternation,"
00:06:26.960,00:06:28.640,再轮替后的台湾,,,
00:06:28.760,00:06:30.640,恐怕连想自我感觉,00:06:28.760,00:06:32.480,Taiwanese won't even have a chance to feel good about themselves.
00:06:30.640,00:06:32.480,良好的机会都没有了,,,
00:06:33.040,00:06:35.600,只有这社论作者他感叹,00:06:33.040,00:06:35.860,"In the end, the author of this editorial sighed:"
00:06:35.880,00:06:38.440,当台湾每个不同立场者,,,
00:06:38.480,00:06:41.520,每天在街头在媒体PK,00:06:35.880,00:06:41.520,"When people with different positions keep on arguing in the media or on the streets every day,"
00:06:41.600,00:06:43.760,当社会弥漫着焦虑不安,00:06:41.600,00:06:44.080,"when Taiwan's society is filled with anxiety,"
00:06:43.760,00:06:45.840,也不必再等张伟伟,,,
00:06:45.840,00:06:47.040,这样的大陆学者,00:06:44.080,00:06:48.960,"we don’t need to wait for mainland scholars, like Zhang Weiwei, to make negative comments."
00:06:47.080,00:06:48.960,做任何负面评论,,,
00:06:49.120,00:06:50.520,台湾的主流民意,,,
00:06:50.520,00:06:51.880,早就通过民调,00:06:49.120,00:06:54.080,"Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion has already rated Taiwan’s democracy through polls, hasn't it?"
00:06:51.880,00:06:53.320,给台湾民主打了分,,,
00:06:53.320,00:06:54.080,不是吗,,,
00:06:54.360,00:06:56.400,当台湾作为负面教材,00:06:54.360,00:06:57.960,"When it gets popular to treat Taiwan as a negative example,"
00:06:56.400,00:06:57.960,成为一种流行,,,
00:06:58.240,00:07:00.040,没有人会感到好过,00:06:58.240,00:07:00.260,none of us feels good.
00:07:00.040,00:07:02.480,但我们是不是也要做一些理性的,00:07:00.400,00:07:03.280,But should we also reflect on ourselves rationally?
00:07:02.480,00:07:02.920,反思,,,
00:07:03.480,00:07:05.400,一个没有理性反思的制度,00:07:03.480,00:07:06.840,How can we say we have a more advanced system without rational re-thinking?
00:07:05.440,00:07:06.840,还谈什么优势呢,,,
00:07:07.600,00:07:09.680,有意思观察者网,00:07:07.600,00:07:11.840,"Interestingly, when guancha.cn firstly shared this editorial,"
00:07:09.800,00:07:11.840,当时把这篇社论刊登了出来,,,
00:07:12.000,00:07:14.000,下面网民热议,00:07:12.000,00:07:14.160,netizens had an enthusiastic discussion.
00:07:14.480,00:07:15.400,因为住在美国,,,
00:07:15.400,00:07:16.600,波士顿的华人,,,
00:07:16.640,00:07:18.280,写的跟贴很雷人,00:07:14.480,00:07:19.300,"A Chinese expat living in Boston in the US
wrote an interesting comment:"
00:07:18.360,00:07:19.320,他这样说的,,,
00:07:19.440,00:07:21.400,说台湾桃园捷运,,,
00:07:21.400,00:07:23.200,1996年规划,00:07:19.720,00:07:23.200,"When Taiwan Taoyuan MRT was planned in 1996,"
00:07:23.360,00:07:26.000,据说不久就要试通车,00:07:23.360,00:07:26.000,they said that the trial operation would start soon.
00:07:26.000,00:07:26.840,不管怎么样,,,
00:07:26.840,00:07:28.160,二十来年建成,00:07:26.000,00:07:28.600,"No matter what, its construction completed in twenty years."
00:07:28.760,00:07:29.600,51公里,,,
00:07:29.640,00:07:31.240,造价大约等于人民币,00:07:28.760,00:07:32.520,"The cost is approximately 26 billion RMB, for 51 kilometers."
00:07:31.280,00:07:32.520,260亿元,,,
00:07:32.520,00:07:34.360,这简直太了不起了,00:07:32.520,00:07:34.360,That is amazing!
00:07:34.480,00:07:36.520,你们看看在我居住这个城市,00:07:34.480,00:07:38.360,"Look at Boston, the city where I live,"
00:07:36.520,00:07:38.360,美国的波斯顿,,,
00:07:38.600,00:07:40.360,有个中心隧道工程,00:07:38.600,00:07:40.640,"there is a central tunnel project,"
00:07:40.360,00:07:42.440,又较大挖掘工程,00:07:40.640,00:07:43.800,AKA the Big Dig.
00:07:42.440,00:07:43.800,因为叫钉钉,,,
00:07:44.160,00:07:46.200,才12公里多一点点,00:07:44.160,00:07:46.200,It's just 12 something kilometers.
00:07:46.440,00:07:48.000,但四十五年过去了,00:07:46.440,00:07:48.000,But 45 years passed
00:07:48.000,00:07:48.880,还没有建成,00:07:48.000,00:07:49.900,and the construction has not finished yet.
00:07:50.120,00:07:51.400,1971年规划,,,
00:07:51.440,00:07:52.960,1991年开始施工,00:07:50.100,00:07:54.560,"Planned in 1971, began in 1991 and is still in progress..."
00:07:52.960,00:07:54.360,迄今还在进行之中,,,
00:07:54.360,00:07:56.520,已经花掉了150亿美元,,,
00:07:56.520,00:07:58.080,也就是1000亿人民币,00:07:54.740,00:07:58.360,"15 billion US dollars have been spent, which is 100 billion RMB."
00:07:58.640,00:08:01.280,几乎比桃园捷运高4倍,00:07:58.640,00:08:01.520,Almost 4 times higher than Taoyuan MRT
00:08:01.720,00:08:03.040,其实采用西方模式,,,
00:08:03.040,00:08:03.560,带来的,00:08:01.720,00:08:04.680,We see that big trouble brought by the western model
00:08:03.560,00:08:04.680,一个很大的困境,,,
00:08:04.720,00:08:07.440,就是各种利益集团和政客,00:08:04.720,00:08:10.000,is the endless disputes triggered by all kinds of interest groups and politicians.
00:08:07.480,00:08:10.000,挑起无穷无尽的党争,,,
00:08:10.120,00:08:11.160,结果以牺牲,00:08:10.120,00:08:11.380,"As a result,"
00:08:11.160,00:08:12.720,包括基础设施在内的,,,
00:08:12.720,00:08:13.000,人民,,,
00:08:13.040,00:08:14.800,整体利益为代价,00:08:11.380,00:08:14.900,the overall interests of the people including infrastructure are sacrificed.
00:08:15.080,00:08:17.200,比方说美国加州想建高铁,,,
00:08:17.200,00:08:19.840,从上世纪八十年代就开始,00:08:15.080,00:08:19.840,"For example, California wants to build a high-speed rail, since the 1980s."
00:08:19.840,00:08:20.720,但迄今为止,,,
00:08:20.720,00:08:22.160,一公里也没有建成,00:08:19.840,00:08:22.160,"So far, zero kilometer has been built."
00:08:22.280,00:08:24.080,因为家族的各个县的议员说,00:08:22.300,00:08:25.840,"Because all the senators demanded a stop to be built in their county,"
00:08:24.080,00:08:25.360,必须在我这里建驿站,,,
00:08:25.360,00:08:27.080,否则高铁就不能通过,00:08:25.920,00:08:28.140,"otherwise, the high-speed rail was not allowed to pass."
00:08:28.320,00:08:29.240,建高铁,,,
00:08:29.240,00:08:30.760,要损害航空公司利益,00:08:28.320,00:08:30.760,Building high-speed rail will harm the interests of airlines
00:08:30.800,00:08:32.160,要损害汽车公司利益,00:08:30.800,00:08:32.500,the interests of car companies
00:08:32.160,00:08:33.600,要受害饭店,,,
00:08:33.600,00:08:35.240,旅馆等等行业的利益,00:08:32.500,00:08:35.420,and the interests of hotels and other industries.
00:08:35.840,00:08:36.720,那么这些公司,,,
00:08:36.760,00:08:39.320,都有强大的游说集团,00:08:35.840,00:08:39.320,These companies had strong lobbying groups
00:08:39.600,00:08:41.440,也可以打各种各样的关系,00:08:39.600,00:08:41.440,and were able to start various lawsuits.
00:08:42.200,00:08:42.760,总而言之,,,
00:08:42.800,00:08:43.520,就西方模式,00:08:42.080,00:08:44.800,"Overall, the western model does have a big problem."
00:08:43.520,00:08:44.800,确实出了大问题,,,
00:08:44.800,00:08:45.840,不改革的话,00:08:44.800,00:08:45.840,"Without reform,"
00:08:45.840,00:08:46.960,美国也好,,,
00:08:46.960,00:08:47.840,台湾地区也好,,,
00:08:47.840,00:08:50.120,恐怕是只能一路走衰,00:08:45.840,00:08:50.420,"whether it is the United States or Taiwan area,
I am afraid that they will only decline all the way."
00:08:50.880,00:08:53.640,那么我记得当年台湾刚开始,00:08:50.880,00:08:55.240,"I remember, when Taiwan first started the so-called Democratization process,"
00:08:53.640,00:08:55.240,所谓民主转型的时候,,,
00:08:55.280,00:08:57.080,美国不少的政治人物,,,
00:08:57.120,00:08:58.440,都说台湾民主,00:08:55.280,00:09:01.000,many American politicians said that Taiwan’s democracy would be a beacon for mainland China.
00:08:58.440,00:08:59.000,能够成为,,,
00:08:59.040,00:09:01.000,照亮中国大陆的灯塔,,,
00:09:01.440,00:09:03.400,现在美国民主灯塔,00:09:01.440,00:09:04.600,Now even the American Democracy Beacon is swaying.
00:09:03.400,00:09:04.600,也是晃晃悠悠,,,
00:09:04.680,00:09:06.760,我们网民调侃为灯塔国,00:09:04.680,00:09:06.760,"Our netizens joke that the US is ""the Beacon Country""."
00:09:06.840,00:09:08.280,自己都失去了方向,,,
00:09:08.280,00:09:09.960,更不用说台湾这个灯塔了,00:09:06.840,00:09:10.140,"The US has already lost its own direction,
not to mention Taiwan's beacon."
00:09:09.960,00:09:11.840,能照亮自己前行的道路,00:09:10.140,00:09:12.880,Can it even illuminate the way for itself?
00:09:11.840,00:09:12.880,就很不错了,,,
00:09:13.400,00:09:14.280,那么台湾民主,,,
00:09:14.280,00:09:15.480,究竟出了什么问题,00:09:13.400,00:09:15.700,So what went wrong in Taiwan's Democracy?
00:09:15.640,00:09:17.400,我和大家初步探讨一下,,,
00:09:17.400,00:09:19.280,一家之言仅供参考,00:09:15.700,00:09:19.280,Let me discuss with you a little bit.
00:09:20.000,00:09:21.400,那么我们可以先看一下,00:09:20.000,00:09:21.400,"First of all,"
00:09:21.520,00:09:22.360,台湾民主化,,,
00:09:22.360,00:09:24.680,三十来年的几个结果,00:09:21.520,00:09:24.680,let's look at the outcomes of Taiwan's democratization in the past 30 years
00:09:24.840,00:09:27.280,首先是经济严重的滑坡,00:09:24.840,00:09:27.280,The first is a serious economic downturn.
00:09:27.400,00:09:30.320,台湾经济G从亚洲四小龙之首,00:09:27.400,00:09:31.680,"Taiwan’s economy has gone from the top of ""The Four Asian Tigers"" to the bottom."
00:09:30.320,00:09:31.680,变成最陌生,,,
00:09:32.000,00:09:34.160,96年民选上来的李登辉,00:09:32.000,00:09:35.960,"Lee Teng-hui, elected in 1996,  implemented the economic policy of “patience without haste”"
00:09:34.160,00:09:36.800,搞借机用台湾失去了,,,
00:09:37.160,00:09:39.280,大陆市场发展的良机,00:09:35.960,00:09:39.280,"As a result, Taiwan lost its opportunity to develop in the mainland market."
00:09:39.320,00:09:41.440,00年民选上来的,,,
00:09:41.440,00:09:42.120,陈水扁,00:09:39.320,00:09:44.200,"Chen Shui-bian, elected in 2000, changed seven Premiers in eight years."
00:09:42.120,00:09:44.200,八年换了七个行政院长,,,
00:09:44.480,00:09:45.800,搞权术平衡,,,
00:09:45.800,00:09:47.280,不是搞经济建设,00:09:44.480,00:09:47.280,He focused on balancing powers instead of developing the economy.
00:09:47.320,00:09:49.920,连续八年的公共投资负数,00:09:47.320,00:09:51.680,"For eight consecutive years, the public investment was negative, and economic declined rapidly."
00:09:50.000,00:09:51.680,经济急剧走衰,,,
00:09:51.880,00:09:53.320,08年民选上来的,,,
00:09:53.320,00:09:55.080,马英九民调支持率,00:09:51.880,00:09:57.800,"Ma Ying-jeou, elected in 2008, had even lower approval ratings than Chen Shui-bian's."
00:09:55.080,00:09:57.800,后来甚至低于陈水扁当年的水平,,,
00:09:57.960,00:09:59.480,但他有一点事做对了,00:09:57.960,00:09:59.480,But he did one thing right:
00:09:59.480,00:10:00.880,就承认九二共识,00:09:59.480,00:10:00.880,acknowledging the 1992 Consensus.
00:10:00.920,00:10:02.320,是在一段时间内,00:10:00.920,00:10:03.720,"It stabilized cross-strait relations for a period of time,"
00:10:02.320,00:10:03.720,稳定了两岸关系,,,
00:10:03.760,00:10:06.440,加强了与大陆的经济融合,00:10:03.760,00:10:06.440,and strengthened economic integration with the mainland.
00:10:07.000,00:10:08.880,那么台湾经济大陆相比,,,
00:10:09.000,00:10:10.680,更是三十年河东三十年,00:10:07.000,00:10:11.560,"Compared to the Mainland, Taiwan’s economy changed like the Yellow River’s course."
00:10:10.680,00:10:12.040,河西台湾,,,
00:10:12.040,00:10:13.960,所谓民主化起步的时候,00:10:12.040,00:10:14.100,When Taiwan’s so-called democratization started
00:10:13.960,00:10:16.280,也就是上世纪八十年代末,00:10:14.100,00:10:16.280,"in the late 1980s,"
00:10:16.640,00:10:17.640,台湾经济规模,,,
00:10:17.640,00:10:19.960,大约是大陆的45%,00:10:16.640,00:10:19.960,Taiwan’s economy was about 45% of the mainland’s.
00:10:20.560,00:10:21.760,30年过去,00:10:20.560,00:10:21.760,"30 years have passed,"
00:10:21.760,00:10:23.240,台湾今天的经济规模,00:10:21.760,00:10:23.240,Taiwan's economy today
00:10:23.240,00:10:25.760,大约是只有大陆经济的4%,00:10:23.240,00:10:25.760,is only about 4% of the mainland economy.
00:10:26.040,00:10:28.480,今年深圳一个市的财政收入,00:10:26.040,00:10:28.480,The revenue of Shenzhen city now
00:10:28.480,00:10:31.120,就超过整个台湾的财政收入,00:10:28.480,00:10:31.120,surpasses the total fiscal revenue of Taiwan.
00:10:31.280,00:10:32.240,也就是说,00:10:31.280,00:10:32.240,"In other words,"
00:10:32.680,00:10:34.880,我们深圳市市长手中的预算,,,
00:10:34.880,00:10:37.880,大于台湾蔡省长掌管的预算,00:10:32.680,00:10:37.880,The budgets made by the mayor of Shenzhen are larger than Taiwan governor's.
00:10:39.200,00:10:40.760,多数百姓的实际收入,00:10:38.960,00:10:40.760,"The real income of most people,"
00:10:40.760,00:10:42.080,包括大学毕业生,00:10:40.760,00:10:42.080,including college graduates
00:10:42.080,00:10:43.400,在台湾近二十年,00:10:42.080,00:10:44.400,has not increased for the past 20 years.
00:10:43.400,00:10:44.400,没有增加,,,
00:10:44.720,00:10:46.040,台湾芯片工程师,00:10:44.720,00:10:46.040,Chip engineers in Taiwan
00:10:46.040,00:10:47.640,纷纷跳槽到大陆工作,00:10:46.040,00:10:47.640,have moved to the mainland for work.
00:10:47.640,00:10:49.800,因为大陆的收入是台湾的三倍,00:10:47.640,00:10:49.800,Because the mainland’s income is three times that of Taiwan’s
00:10:50.920,00:10:53.240,第二是政治恶斗加剧,00:10:50.920,00:10:53.240,The second is intensifying political strife.
00:10:53.720,00:10:54.560,一些人还认为,,,
00:10:54.560,00:10:55.160,台湾民主,,,
00:10:55.240,00:10:57.240,至少实现了多次政党轮替,00:10:53.720,00:10:57.240,Some people still believe that Taiwan’s democracy has at least enabled party alternation for several times
00:10:57.240,00:10:59.160,这是了不起的成就,00:10:57.240,00:10:59.160,They see this as a great achievement.
00:10:59.360,00:11:00.920,实际上每次轮替之后,00:10:59.360,00:11:00.920,"Actually after each alternation,"
00:11:00.920,00:11:02.080,就是一个政党,,,
00:11:02.080,00:11:04.000,对另一个政党的掠夺,00:11:00.920,00:11:05.500,"the ruling party begins to plunder,
liquidate and retaliate another party."
00:11:04.040,00:11:05.640,清算报复,,,
00:11:06.280,00:11:07.960,例如蔡英文上台后,00:11:06.280,00:11:07.960,"For example, after Tsai Ing-wen came to power,"
00:11:07.960,00:11:09.600,不是优先解决经济问题,00:11:07.960,00:11:10.440,she didn't prioritize economic issues and people’s livelihood.
00:11:09.600,00:11:10.440,民生问题,,,
00:11:10.480,00:11:13.320,而是热衷于推动所谓的转型正义,00:11:10.480,00:11:13.320,"Instead, she was keen on promoting so-called transformational justice."
00:11:13.840,00:11:15.040,民进党利用自己,,,
00:11:15.040,00:11:18.280,在立法院占多数的优势,00:11:13.840,00:11:18.280,The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan used its majority vote advantage
00:11:18.280,00:11:19.200,通过了,,,
00:11:19.600,00:11:21.960,叫做不当党产处理条例,00:11:18.280,00:11:21.960,and passed regulations on the disposition of ill-gotten party assets.
00:11:21.960,00:11:23.520,也就剥夺国民党的财产,00:11:21.960,00:11:23.520,"That is to deprive Kuomintang (KMT,
aka the Nationalist Party) of its property"
00:11:23.520,00:11:24.360,当国民党以后,,,
00:11:24.360,00:11:26.480,没有足够的资源投入选举,00:11:23.520,00:11:26.480,so that Kuomintang will not have enough resources for elections.
00:11:26.840,00:11:29.440,他们还通过了促进转型正义条例,00:11:26.840,00:11:29.440,DPP also passed the transitional justice act.
00:11:29.600,00:11:31.240,意图就是把民进党,00:11:29.600,00:11:32.660,"The intention is to portray the DPP as the incarnation of democracy,"
00:11:31.240,00:11:33.040,描绘为民主的化身,,,
00:11:33.120,00:11:35.360,把国民党定为专制的化身,00:11:32.660,00:11:35.360,"and make the KMT the incarnation of autocracy,"
00:11:35.360,00:11:38.120,来继续双方你死我活的斗争,00:11:35.520,00:11:38.280,to continue the political strife between the two sides.
00:11:38.480,00:11:40.200,那么在民进党的操作下,00:11:38.480,00:11:40.200,"Then under those maneuvers by the DPP’s,"
00:11:40.200,00:11:41.920,搞台独就是民主,00:11:40.200,00:11:41.920,seeking independence is democracy
00:11:42.000,00:11:43.200,和大陆发展关系,00:11:42.000,00:11:44.280,and developing relations with the mainland is autocracy.
00:11:43.200,00:11:44.280,就是专职,,,
00:11:44.560,00:11:45.080,这种情况,,,
00:11:45.120,00:11:46.440,今天在香港的乱局中,00:11:44.560,00:11:47.400,This situation can also be seen in the chaos in Hong Kong today:
00:11:46.440,00:11:47.400,我们也可以看到,,,
00:11:47.440,00:11:48.840,反大陆就是民主,00:11:47.440,00:11:48.840,Anti-Mainland is democracy;
00:11:48.880,00:11:49.560,支持大陆,,,
00:11:49.560,00:11:50.720,就是专制,00:11:48.880,00:11:50.720,Pro-Mainland is autocracy.
00:11:50.760,00:11:52.720,我把这叫做愚昧之极,00:11:50.760,00:11:52.720,I call this the extreme of ignorance.
00:11:53.560,00:11:55.160,我们大家在店上看到了,,,
00:11:55.160,00:11:56.520,很多台湾立法院,00:11:53.560,00:11:58.000,We’ve seen a lot of physical assaults in Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan on TV.
00:11:56.560,00:11:58.000,肢体冲突的恶斗,,,
00:11:58.000,00:11:59.240,有一个统计,00:11:58.000,00:11:59.240,"There is a statistic,"
00:11:59.440,00:12:01.880,从2008年到2016年,00:11:59.440,00:12:01.880,"from 2008 to 2016,"
00:12:02.040,00:12:02.680,八年间,00:12:02.040,00:12:02.680,8 years，
00:12:03.200,00:12:05.880,民进党立法机构开会的时候,,,
00:12:05.880,00:12:08.480,霸占主席台多达将近一,00:12:03.200,00:12:09.240,the DPP occupied the rostrum nearly a hundred times when the legislature was in session.
00:12:08.520,00:12:09.240,百次,,,
00:12:09.440,00:12:11.240,上演各种各样的肢体冲突,00:12:09.440,00:12:12.600,"There were various physical conflicts, including deliberate attacks."
00:12:11.240,00:12:12.600,甚至大打出手,,,
00:12:12.760,00:12:13.440,这样的民族,,,
00:12:13.440,00:12:15.360,怎么能够赢得别人的尊重,00:12:12.760,00:12:15.580,How can such a democracy win the respect of others?
00:12:16.080,00:12:17.240,台湾媒体的生态,,,
00:12:17.280,00:12:18.640,也发生了巨大的变化,00:12:16.080,00:12:18.640,Taiwan’s media ecology has also undergone tremendous changes.
00:12:18.800,00:12:20.840,台湾媒体在两蒋时期,00:12:18.800,00:12:20.840,Taiwanese media in the two-Chiangs period [1949-1987]
00:12:20.960,00:12:22.160,被叫作哈巴狗,00:12:20.960,00:12:22.460,was called pet dogs.
00:12:22.480,00:12:24.120,现在被叫做疯狗,00:12:22.480,00:12:24.480,Now they are called mad dogs.
00:12:24.800,00:12:25.760,族群矛盾,,,
00:12:25.760,00:12:26.760,被故意挑起,00:12:24.800,00:12:26.760,"Ethnic conflicts were deliberately provoked"""
00:12:26.760,00:12:27.920,什么外省人,00:12:26.760,00:12:28.560,the outsider vs the local;
00:12:27.920,00:12:28.560,本省人,,,
00:12:28.560,00:12:29.200,台湾人,,,
00:12:29.200,00:12:31.680,中国人等等族群被撕裂,00:12:28.600,00:12:31.680,tearing apart Taiwanese and Chinese  groups.
00:12:31.720,00:12:34.680,政府丧失对社会的整合能力,00:12:31.720,00:12:34.680,The government lost its ability to integrate society.
00:12:35.000,00:12:37.200,第三是腐败有增无减,00:12:35.000,00:12:37.200,The third is increased corruption.
00:12:37.480,00:12:38.600,台湾民主化后,,,
00:12:38.600,00:12:40.080,黑道和金钱,00:12:37.480,00:12:41.800,"After the democratization of Taiwan, the underworld and money intervene in politics as they please."
00:12:40.080,00:12:41.800,大规模的介入争执,,,
00:12:42.360,00:12:45.760,台湾民主化迅速的变成市场化,00:12:42.360,00:12:45.760,Democratization quickly turned into marketization.
00:12:46.240,00:12:49.600,陈水扁8年执政贪婪敛财,00:12:46.240,00:12:50.640,Chen Shui-bian acquired a shocking amount of properties during his 8 years in office.
00:12:49.760,00:12:50.640,令人发止,,,
00:12:50.680,00:12:52.400,最后是锒铛入狱,00:12:50.680,00:12:52.260,He went to jail
00:12:52.520,00:12:53.560,然后又保释出来,00:12:52.260,00:12:53.560,and got released on bail.
00:12:53.720,00:12:54.880,我就不想多谈,,,
00:12:54.920,00:12:56.160,大家都很熟悉,00:12:53.720,00:12:56.180,"I don't want to keep on talking about this -
we're all familiar with this story."
00:12:56.440,00:12:57.640,早在2009年,00:12:56.440,00:12:57.640,"Back in 2009,"
00:12:57.640,00:13:01.080,也就在大陆出台8项规定之前,00:12:57.640,00:13:01.080,"before the mainland issued ""The Eight Regulations"","
00:13:02.160,00:13:04.600,亚洲政经风险公司,00:13:02.160,00:13:06.440,Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) published a report.
00:13:04.600,00:13:06.520,在09年的报告中就认为,,,
00:13:06.520,00:13:08.960,台湾地区的腐败程度高于大陆,00:13:06.440,00:13:08.960,The report believed the level of corruption in Taiwan is higher than in mainland China
00:13:09.160,00:13:11.560,当时马英九痛心疾首,00:13:09.160,00:13:11.560,That made Ma Ying-jeou heartbroken.
00:13:11.960,00:13:13.120,那么在马英九时期,,,
00:13:13.200,00:13:15.400,虽然马英九本人还算清廉,00:13:11.960,00:13:15.400,"In the Ma Ying-jeou period, Ma Ying-jeou himself was relatively incorruptible."
00:13:15.400,00:13:17.440,但也出现了很多贪腐事件,00:13:15.400,00:13:17.440,But there were many corruption cases -
00:13:17.440,00:13:19.040,他管不住下面的人,00:13:17.440,00:13:19.320,he couldn't control his subordinates.
00:13:19.240,00:13:20.160,因此他的政府,,,
00:13:20.200,00:13:22.240,在民众中的形象也不好,00:13:19.320,00:13:22.240,So his administration didn't have a good reputation among the people.
00:13:22.280,00:13:25.000,国民党多位高官接连贪腐,00:13:22.280,00:13:25.000,Corruptions of senior KMT officials are reported one after another.
00:13:25.040,00:13:26.320,使得台湾民众,,,
00:13:26.320,00:13:28.960,发出蓝绿皆贪的感叹,00:13:25.040,00:13:28.960,Taiwanese people sighed that both blue (KMT) and green (DPP) are greedy.
00:13:29.520,00:13:31.040,各种形式的贿赂,,,
00:13:31.040,00:13:31.640,会选,00:13:29.520,00:13:33.160,"Various forms of bribery, including election bribery, remain unabated."
00:13:31.640,00:13:33.160,更是屡禁不绝,,,
00:13:33.320,00:13:34.080,最新的丑闻,00:13:33.280,00:13:34.320,The latest scandal is:
00:13:34.120,00:13:34.280,就是,,,
00:13:34.280,00:13:35.880,蔡英文出访的专机上,,,
00:13:35.920,00:13:38.840,竟然有官员走私近万条香烟,00:13:34.320,00:13:38.840,"On Tsai Ing-wen’s official airplane, there were officials smuggling nearly 10,000 cigarettes."
00:13:40.080,00:13:42.400,第四就是台湾对大陆的文化,00:13:40.080,00:13:44.080,The fourth is that Taiwan’s cultural soft power over the mainland has declined on all fronts.
00:13:42.400,00:13:42.960,软实力,,,
00:13:42.960,00:13:44.080,全面衰退,,,
00:13:44.080,00:13:45.840,我2013年去台湾时候,,,
00:13:45.840,00:13:46.160,发现,,,
00:13:46.160,00:13:48.840,大陆的电视连续剧甄嬛传火遍,00:13:44.080,00:13:49.520,The mainland TV series Empresses in the Palace was popular in Taiwan when I visited Taiwan in 2013.
00:13:48.840,00:13:49.520,台湾,,,
00:13:49.800,00:13:51.520,那么大陆的历史正剧,,,
00:13:51.520,00:13:52.920,纷纷被台湾抢购,00:13:49.780,00:13:53.380,"Actually, Mainland’s historical dramas were aired in Taiwan as big hits:"
00:13:52.920,00:13:54.480,热波鲁泽天,00:13:53.380,00:13:54.680,"The Empress of China [Wu Zetian],"
00:13:54.760,00:13:55.720,康熙王朝,00:13:54.760,00:13:55.980,"Kangxi Dynasty,"
00:13:55.960,00:13:57.200,雍正王朝,00:13:55.980,00:13:57.200,"Yongzheng Dynasty,"
00:13:57.280,00:13:58.160,汉武大帝,00:13:57.280,00:13:58.180,"The Emperor Han Wu,"
00:13:58.160,00:13:58.800,大宅门,00:13:58.180,00:13:59.320,"The Grand Mansion Gate,"
00:13:59.240,00:14:00.480,乔家大院等等,00:13:59.320,00:14:00.480,Qiao's Grand Courtyard etc..
00:14:00.560,00:14:03.520,收视率在台湾都是比较好的,00:14:00.560,00:14:03.520,Their ratings are quite good in Taiwan.
00:14:04.000,00:14:05.520,那么台湾民进党政客认为,,,
00:14:05.560,00:14:07.320,大陆正在给台湾人洗脑,00:14:04.000,00:14:07.320,Then DPP politicians believe that the mainland is brainwashing the Taiwanese.
00:14:07.800,00:14:09.400,他们担心的多了一点,00:14:07.800,00:14:09.400,They worry a bit too much.
00:14:10.080,00:14:11.520,这想着二三十年前,00:14:10.080,00:14:11.520,"Twenty or thirty years ago,"
00:14:11.560,00:14:14.440,整个大陆都在听邓丽君看琼瑶剧,00:14:11.560,00:14:14.440,the entire mainland was listening to Teresa Teng and watching Chiung Yao's drama.
00:14:14.440,00:14:15.840,真有三年河东,,,
00:14:15.840,00:14:17.320,三年河西的感觉,00:14:14.600,00:14:17.480,"It feels like ""you're on the other side of Yellow River after 30 years"" [its course changes frequently]."
00:14:17.800,00:14:18.920,大陆的电商,,,
00:14:18.920,00:14:19.600,也在改变,00:14:17.800,00:14:21.200,Mainland e-commerce is also changing the way of life of many in Taiwan.
00:14:19.600,00:14:21.200,许多台湾人的生活方式,,,
00:14:21.200,00:14:23.160,淘宝的粉丝非常多,00:14:21.200,00:14:23.160,Taobao has a lot of fans.
00:14:23.200,00:14:23.960,我前面提到,00:14:23.200,00:14:24.380,"As I mentioned earlier,"
00:14:24.280,00:14:25.880,我对台湾民主的研判,00:14:24.380,00:14:25.880,"according to my research on Taiwan's democracy,"
00:14:26.560,00:14:27.920,一直比较悲观,00:14:26.560,00:14:28.180,I have always been pessimistic on it -
00:14:28.080,00:14:29.800,也就讲的从希望到失望,00:14:28.180,00:14:29.800,from hope to disappointment.
00:14:29.840,00:14:31.320,如果没有中国大陆帮助,,,
00:14:31.320,00:14:32.960,将从希望到绝望,00:14:29.840,00:14:32.960,"And without help from mainland China, it would fall from hope to desperation."
00:14:33.080,00:14:36.000,实际上我对整个非西方社会,,,
00:14:36.120,00:14:37.480,采用西方政治模式,00:14:33.080,00:14:39.200,I hold this opinion for all the non-Western societies which adopt the Western political model.
00:14:37.520,00:14:39.200,都是判断,,,
00:14:39.640,00:14:41.360,如果香港颜色革命,00:14:39.640,00:14:42.880,"If unfortunately, the Hong Kong Color Revolution succeeds,"
00:14:41.400,00:14:42.880,不幸成功的话,,,
00:14:42.880,00:14:45.320,那么香港将直接从希望到绝望,00:14:42.880,00:14:45.620,then Hong Kong will directly fall from hope to desperation.
00:14:45.920,00:14:47.400,我这是另外一个大的话题,,,
00:14:47.400,00:14:49.040,以后有机会我们再谈,00:14:45.920,00:14:49.220,This is another big topic for us to talk about in the future.
00:14:49.840,00:14:51.600,我今天讲的就是台湾的民主,,,
00:14:51.600,00:14:53.800,下一步估计是什么样情况,00:14:49.840,00:14:53.800,What I’m talking about today is what's next for Taiwan’s democracy.
00:14:53.800,00:14:55.480,我估计是更大的失望,00:14:53.800,00:14:55.560,"I guess it's an even greater disappointment,"
00:14:55.560,00:14:57.280,但一时还不至于绝望,00:14:55.560,00:14:57.780,but may not be desperation for a while.
00:14:58.000,00:14:59.400,什么不至于绝望呢,00:14:58.000,00:14:59.400,Why not?
00:14:59.600,00:15:00.520,只有几个原因,00:14:59.600,00:15:00.520,For a few reasons:
00:15:00.560,00:15:03.880,首先就是台湾在所谓民主化之前,00:15:00.560,00:15:03.880,"The first is that before the democratization,"
00:15:04.000,00:15:05.640,也就在两蒋时期,00:15:04.000,00:15:05.640,"in the two-Chiangs period,"
00:15:05.640,00:15:07.280,特别在蒋经国时期,00:15:05.640,00:15:07.420,"especially during the Chiang Ching-kuo period [autocracy 1978-1988],"
00:15:07.280,00:15:09.640,已经初步实现了现代化,00:15:07.420,00:15:09.640,Taiwan was initially modernized.
00:15:09.760,00:15:12.440,那么中产阶级的比重还比较大,00:15:09.760,00:15:12.440,The middle class had a relatively large proportion in the society.
00:15:12.560,00:15:13.920,如果当初就采用,00:15:12.560,00:15:15.120,"If the Western democratic model was adopted from the beginning,"
00:15:13.920,00:15:15.120,西方民主模式的话,,,
00:15:15.120,00:15:16.600,我想台湾根本就不可能,,,
00:15:16.640,00:15:18.600,实现初步的现代化,00:15:15.120,00:15:18.840,I believe it would be impossible for Taiwan to achieve initial modernization
00:15:19.480,00:15:21.560,第二点是中国传统文化,00:15:19.480,00:15:21.560,The second is Chinese traditional culture.
00:15:21.600,00:15:23.720,在台湾基本上没有中断,00:15:21.600,00:15:23.720,It was uninterrupted and inherited in Taiwan.
00:15:23.720,00:15:24.840,这意味着,00:15:23.720,00:15:24.840,It means
00:15:24.840,00:15:27.560,只要能够维持最基本的稳定,00:15:24.840,00:15:27.560,"as long as Taiwan can maintain basic stability,"
00:15:27.720,00:15:29.280,老百姓吃苦耐劳,00:15:27.720,00:15:29.280,"people work hard,"
00:15:29.280,00:15:31.280,重视教育辛勤工作,00:15:29.280,00:15:31.280,"focus on education and work,"
00:15:31.280,00:15:33.320,整个经济不至于崩溃,00:15:31.280,00:15:33.320,then its economy will not collapse
00:15:33.880,00:15:34.280,第三,,,
00:15:34.360,00:15:34.920,非常重要,00:15:33.880,00:15:34.920,"Thirdly, very importantly,"
00:15:34.960,00:15:36.440,就是中国模式的影响,00:15:34.960,00:15:36.440,It is the impact of the China model.
00:15:36.440,00:15:37.040,某种意义上,,,
00:15:37.080,00:15:37.520,可以说,,,
00:15:37.520,00:15:37.720,是,,,
00:15:37.720,00:15:39.560,中国模式拯救了台湾,00:15:36.440,00:15:39.560,"In a sense, the China model saved Taiwan."
00:15:39.760,00:15:40.280,经济上,,,
00:15:40.320,00:15:40.880,中国模式,,,
00:15:40.880,00:15:43.440,带来中国大陆的迅速的崛起,00:15:39.760,00:15:43.440,"Economically, the China model has brought about the rapid rise of mainland China."
00:15:43.480,00:15:45.160,为台湾经济和台湾同胞,00:15:43.480,00:15:46.680,It provides a lot of opportunities for Taiwan’s economy and people.
00:15:45.160,00:15:46.680,提供了大量的机会,,,
00:15:47.040,00:15:48.480,政治上中国模式,,,
00:15:48.480,00:15:51.120,通过选贤任能机制产生的领导人,00:15:47.040,00:15:51.120,"Politically, the China model selects leaders through a meritocratic system."
00:15:51.360,00:15:53.400,比台湾民粹主义产生领导人,,,
00:15:53.400,00:15:54.400,更为理性,00:15:51.360,00:15:55.540,More rational and mature compared to the leaders elected by populism in Taiwan.
00:15:54.400,00:15:55.520,更为成熟,,,
00:15:55.600,00:15:57.520,比方说2008年,00:15:55.600,00:15:57.520,"For example in 2008,"
00:15:57.520,00:15:59.800,西方挑起西藏的暴乱,00:15:57.520,00:15:59.800,the West provoked riots in Tibet.
00:15:59.960,00:16:02.760,当时马英九在民进党的压力下,,,
00:16:02.760,00:16:03.760,也大声疾呼,00:15:59.960,00:16:05.640,"At that time, Ma Ying-jeou, under pressure from the DPP, also claimed to boycott the Beijing Olympics."
00:16:03.760,00:16:05.640,要抵制北京奥运会,,,
00:16:05.800,00:16:07.480,但大领导人权衡利弊,00:16:05.800,00:16:07.480,"However, the mainland leaders weighed the pros and cons,"
00:16:07.480,00:16:09.120,没有计较马英九的表现,00:16:07.480,00:16:09.120,and didn't take action on that.
00:16:09.160,00:16:11.920,而是着眼于两岸人民的长远利益,00:16:09.160,00:16:11.920,"Instead, they focused on the long-term interests of the people on both sides of the strait."
00:16:11.920,00:16:14.000,避免了两岸关系的恶化,00:16:11.920,00:16:14.280,It avoided the deterioration of the cross-strait relationship.
00:16:14.320,00:16:16.040,如果双方都是民粹主义,00:16:14.320,00:16:17.480,"If both of us were led by populism-elected leaders,"
00:16:16.040,00:16:16.680,选出来的,,,
00:16:16.680,00:16:17.480,领导人的话,,,
00:16:17.560,00:16:18.360,两岸关系,,,
00:16:18.360,00:16:20.760,恐怕就要陷入剧烈的动荡,00:16:17.560,00:16:20.760,the cross-strait relations would expect a violent turmoil.
00:16:21.960,00:16:23.200,那么为什么台湾民主,,,
00:16:23.200,00:16:25.600,可能带来更大的失望,00:16:21.960,00:16:25.600,Why Taiwan’s democracy may bring greater disappointment?
00:16:26.160,00:16:27.600,因为台湾民主困境,00:16:26.160,00:16:27.600,Because of Taiwan's democratic predicament
00:16:27.720,00:16:29.680,主要是有一些深层次的,00:16:27.720,00:16:31.360,is mainly caused by some deep-seated structural problems.
00:16:29.680,00:16:31.360,结构性的问题造成,,,
00:16:31.600,00:16:33.520,我跟大家来探讨一下,00:16:31.600,00:16:33.520,I will share some of my thoughts.
00:16:33.520,00:16:35.840,首先就是一个比较成熟的民主,00:16:33.520,00:16:36.520,"First of all, a relatively mature democratic system"
00:16:35.840,00:16:36.520,制度,,,
00:16:36.520,00:16:39.320,一般都聚焦辩论公共政策问题,00:16:36.520,00:16:39.320,"focuses more on debating public policy issues,"
00:16:39.400,00:16:41.120,而不是意识形态的层面,00:16:39.400,00:16:41.120,rather than ideologies.
00:16:41.280,00:16:41.960,今天好了,,,
00:16:42.000,00:16:43.800,从华盛顿到伦敦,00:16:41.280,00:16:43.800,"Well today, from Washington to London,"
00:16:43.840,00:16:45.000,大家争论的都是,,,
00:16:45.040,00:16:46.880,你死我活的意识形态问题,00:16:43.840,00:16:46.880,everyone is arguing fiercely about ideological issues.
00:16:47.080,00:16:48.640,西方国家治理能力,,,
00:16:48.680,00:16:50.440,也因此而急剧下降,00:16:47.000,00:16:50.440,"As a consequence, the governance capacity of Western countries has dropped sharply."
00:16:50.560,00:16:52.400,台湾地区就更是如此了,00:16:50.560,00:16:52.540,And that is even more true in the Taiwan area.
00:16:52.680,00:16:53.840,成熟的民主制度,,,
00:16:53.880,00:16:56.160,一定要在涉及民族国家等,00:16:52.680,00:16:56.160,A mature democratic system must be built based on a broad consensus
00:16:56.200,00:16:58.080,最根本的政治问题上,00:16:56.200,00:16:59.360,on the most fundamental political issues concerning the nation and the state.
00:16:58.080,00:16:59.360,有广泛共识,,,
00:16:59.360,00:17:01.160,而台湾做不到这一点,00:16:59.360,00:17:01.160,And Taiwan can't do this.
00:17:01.400,00:17:03.040,当一个社会的主流,,,
00:17:03.080,00:17:04.720,是在争论台,00:17:01.400,00:17:06.000,"When the mainstream of society is arguing about
""loving Taiwan or betraying Taiwan"","
00:17:04.760,00:17:06.000,还是卖台,,,
00:17:06.440,00:17:09.360,这个社会就一定陷入剧烈的对抗,00:17:06.440,00:17:09.360,this society will fall into intense confrontations.
00:17:09.360,00:17:11.480,而且政客很容易打民粹牌,00:17:09.360,00:17:11.680,"What is more, it’s easy for politicians to play the populist card"
00:17:11.480,00:17:13.600,通过煽动族群对立,00:17:11.680,00:17:14.920,to get votes by inciting conflicts among ethnic groups.
00:17:13.640,00:17:14.920,来获取选票,,,
00:17:15.040,00:17:17.760,结果就是族群撕裂斗不断,00:17:15.040,00:17:18.120,The result is that the ethnic groups are torn apart and in constant fights.
00:17:18.400,00:17:20.440,第二就是台湾的法律制度,00:17:18.400,00:17:22.120,The second is that Taiwan’s legal system does not have enough credibility.
00:17:20.520,00:17:22.120,没有足够的公信力,,,
00:17:22.120,00:17:24.920,比方说人们不满台湾高等法院,00:17:22.120,00:17:24.920,"For example, people were not satisfied with the court's ruling that"
00:17:24.960,00:17:26.320,对两颗子弹带来的,00:17:24.960,00:17:27.600,"helped with Chen Shui-bian's re-election
based on the two bullets they found."
00:17:26.320,00:17:27.600,陈水扁当选,,,
00:17:27.800,00:17:29.560,那是2004年,00:17:27.800,00:17:29.560,It was 2004.
00:17:30.400,00:17:31.080,这个裁定,00:17:29.620,00:17:31.580,They made this ruling.
00:17:31.080,00:17:33.160,所以红衫军数百万人,00:17:31.580,00:17:34.760,"So millions of ""red shirts"" went to the streets to protest."
00:17:33.200,00:17:34.760,走上街头抗争,,,
00:17:34.960,00:17:38.240,这反映了人民对现有的司法体制,00:17:34.960,00:17:38.240,This reflects the people’s suspicion of the existing judicial system
00:17:38.840,00:17:41.200,和在体制内解决问题,00:17:38.840,00:17:42.560,and how problems are solved within this system.
00:17:41.200,00:17:42.560,持怀疑态度,,,
00:17:42.640,00:17:45.000,台湾的司法系统监察系统,00:17:42.640,00:17:46.380,"Taiwan’s judicial system and investigatory
system has not yet been able to establish a mechanism"
00:17:45.000,00:17:46.400,还没有能够建立起一种,,,
00:17:46.400,00:17:48.640,超越党派政治分歧的制度,00:17:46.500,00:17:48.840,that transcends partisanship and political differences.
00:17:49.680,00:17:50.680,那么第三点是,,,
00:17:50.680,00:17:53.440,台湾的选举制度设计是有问题的,00:17:49.680,00:17:53.620,The third point is the design of Taiwan's electoral system is problematic.
00:17:53.480,00:17:55.560,因为台湾领导人选举,,,
00:17:55.960,00:17:57.920,是第1轮简单多数,00:17:53.620,00:17:57.920,The first round is a simple majority system
00:17:57.960,00:17:59.840,就决定结果了,00:17:57.960,00:17:59.840,and it determines the result.
00:18:00.240,00:18:01.920,那么2千年选举的时候,00:18:00.240,00:18:03.360,"Then in the 2000 elections, there was internal conflicts within the KMT."
00:18:01.920,00:18:03.360,国民党内讧,,,
00:18:03.360,00:18:05.560,结果陈水扁以30%多,00:18:03.360,00:18:07.320,"As a result, Chen Shui-bian was elected with a little more than 30% of the vote."
00:18:05.640,00:18:07.320,这个选票就当选了,,,
00:18:07.880,00:18:09.360,假设像法国那样,,,
00:18:09.360,00:18:11.320,比方第1轮候选人,00:18:07.880,00:18:12.140,"In France, for example, if the candidates get less than 50% of the votes in round one,"
00:18:11.320,00:18:12.800,得票低于50%的话,,,
00:18:12.840,00:18:14.320,要举行第2轮选票,00:18:12.140,00:18:14.380,a second round of voting will be held.
00:18:14.360,00:18:15.200,那么当时结果,,,
00:18:15.200,00:18:16.960,可能就会完全不一样了,00:18:14.380,00:18:16.960,The result could have been completely different.
00:18:17.400,00:18:18.960,但选举相关的法律,00:18:17.400,00:18:20.440,But it’s very difficult to amend election-related laws.
00:18:18.960,00:18:20.440,要修改是非常难的,,,
00:18:20.440,00:18:22.640,这也是西方模式普遍陷入,,,
00:18:22.680,00:18:23.600,体制僵化,00:18:20.440,00:18:25.260,This is also the general problem brought by institutional and legal rigidity in the Western model.
00:18:23.600,00:18:25.520,法制僵化带来的问题,,,
00:18:25.600,00:18:27.240,比方说美国要改革的话,00:18:25.600,00:18:28.600,"For example, if the United States wants to reform, it must amend the constitution."
00:18:27.240,00:18:28.480,就要修宪,,,
00:18:28.720,00:18:31.240,但在美国党派高度对立情况下,00:18:28.720,00:18:31.060,But this kind of constitutional amendment is almost impossible
00:18:31.240,00:18:33.000,这种修宪几乎是不可能,00:18:31.060,00:18:33.000,with current opposition between American parties.
00:18:33.000,00:18:34.360,所以就没法进行改革,00:18:33.000,00:18:35.000,So there is no way to make a reform.
00:18:35.480,00:18:37.080,第四点就是公民文化,00:18:35.480,00:18:37.080,The fourth point is civic culture:
00:18:37.080,00:18:38.680,公民文化严重不足,00:18:37.080,00:18:38.680,The civic culture is seriously inadequate.
00:18:38.680,00:18:39.640,所谓公民文化,00:18:38.680,00:18:40.560,The so-called civic culture is
00:18:39.640,00:18:40.560,本来就是一种,,,
00:18:40.560,00:18:41.280,我叫做,00:18:40.560,00:18:42.080,what I call
00:18:42.280,00:18:44.440,特定的习俗和态度,00:18:42.280,00:18:44.440,specific customs and attitudes.
00:18:44.800,00:18:46.520,特点就是你要尊重你的对手,00:18:44.800,00:18:48.080,The feature is to respect your opponent and respect the minority.
00:18:46.520,00:18:47.640,尊重少数,,,
00:18:48.360,00:18:48.840,换言之,00:18:48.180,00:18:49.380,"In other words,"
00:18:48.880,00:18:50.800,台湾仅仅实现了选举民主,00:18:49.380,00:18:51.100,"Taiwan merely achieved electoral democracy,"
00:18:50.800,00:18:53.560,但公民文化仍然严重缺位,00:18:51.140,00:18:53.540,but civic culture is still gravely absent.
00:18:53.720,00:18:54.680,明白了一种,,,
00:18:54.680,00:18:55.400,我们学术界,,,
00:18:55.440,00:18:57.320,称之为叫非自由的民族,00:18:53.720,00:18:59.160,"It’s full of what the academia calls ""illiberal democracy."""
00:18:57.320,00:18:59.160,一类不如给max,,,
00:18:59.600,00:19:00.920,是这样一种气氛,00:18:59.600,00:19:00.920,"In such an atmosphere,"
00:19:00.960,00:19:01.800,什么台湾人,,,
00:19:02.200,00:19:04.680,台湾成为一种民粹的符号,00:19:00.960,00:19:04.680,‘Taiwanese’ and ‘love Taiwan’ have become populist symbols.
00:19:04.840,00:19:06.920,政治对手的一切主张,00:19:04.840,00:19:08.340,All claims of political opponents can be demonized
00:19:06.960,00:19:08.320,都可以被妖魔化,,,
00:19:08.320,00:19:09.280,被抹黑,,,
00:19:09.320,00:19:10.520,抹红抹黄,00:19:08.340,00:19:10.520,and discredited through political labeling
00:19:10.520,00:19:11.640,各种各样的手段,00:19:10.520,00:19:11.940,and other means.
00:19:11.960,00:19:12.960,把人性中,,,
00:19:12.960,00:19:14.440,很多黑暗的东西,00:19:11.960,00:19:15.840,They can bring out the dark side in human nature.
00:19:14.440,00:19:15.840,调动出来了,,,
00:19:16.320,00:19:17.720,2014年春天,00:19:16.320,00:19:17.720,"In the spring of 2014,"
00:19:17.720,00:19:18.960,台湾大学生,,,
00:19:19.000,00:19:21.720,蔑视法制的太阳花运动,00:19:17.720,00:19:21.720,Taiwan's college students occupied the Legislative Yuan and hit the Executive Yuan
00:19:21.760,00:19:23.640,占领立法院,00:19:21.760,00:19:25.440,in their Sun Flower movement despising the legal system.
00:19:23.760,00:19:25.440,冲击行政院,,,
00:19:25.440,00:19:27.600,抗议总体上对台湾有利的,,,
00:19:27.600,00:19:30.000,两岸服务贸易协议,00:19:25.440,00:19:30.000,They protested against the cross-strait service trade agreement which benefits Taiwan overall.
00:19:30.360,00:19:31.840,而这一乱象的背后,00:19:30.360,00:19:31.840,And behind this chaos
00:19:31.840,00:19:33.800,是台湾政党恶斗,00:19:31.840,00:19:33.800,is the political strife
00:19:33.840,00:19:35.600,理性判断的丧失,00:19:33.840,00:19:35.600,"the loss of rational judgment,"
00:19:36.640,00:19:38.200,和整个社会的成本,00:19:36.180,00:19:38.520,and the sinking of the entire society.
00:19:39.320,00:19:40.400,这第五点我觉得是,00:19:39.320,00:19:40.640,"I think, the fifth point is,"
00:19:40.400,00:19:42.840,美国和美国模式的过度影响,00:19:40.640,00:19:42.920,the excessive influence of the US and the US model.
00:19:42.840,00:19:43.800,在台湾,,,
00:19:43.960,00:19:45.120,美国势力的渗透,00:19:42.920,00:19:46.040,"In Taiwan, America's influence has reached everywhere."
00:19:45.120,00:19:46.040,无处不在,,,
00:19:46.080,00:19:48.480,这影响台湾自己的政治探索,00:19:46.080,00:19:48.480,This affects Taiwan’s own political exploration.
00:19:48.720,00:19:51.320,美国模式本身面临巨大的挑战,00:19:48.720,00:19:51.320,The American model itself is facing huge challenges:
00:19:51.360,00:19:52.760,包括资本力量,,,
00:19:52.800,00:19:54.000,对政治力量,00:19:51.360,00:19:56.160,capital is harvesting political and social powers.
00:19:54.040,00:19:56.160,和社会力量的普福祸,,,
00:19:56.520,00:19:58.600,以及民主游戏化的问题,00:19:56.520,00:19:58.600,And the gamification of democracy -
00:19:58.640,00:20:00.280,民主变成一种游戏,00:19:58.640,00:20:00.280,democracy became a game.

00:20:02.760,00:20:03.760,美国自己的模式,,,
00:20:03.760,00:20:04.520,都陷入了,00:20:02.760,00:20:05.800,"America's model has fallen into a ""Trump dilemma""."
00:20:04.520,00:20:05.800,我觉特朗普困境,,,
00:20:05.840,00:20:07.840,或者叫特不靠谱困境,00:20:05.840,00:20:07.840,Or we can also call it the TRuly Unreliable Man Problem (TRUMP) dilemma.
00:20:08.040,00:20:09.520,你说跟着美国亦步亦趋的,00:20:08.040,00:20:10.800,Do you think there is still a future for Taiwan to follow the US model?
00:20:09.560,00:20:10.200,台湾模式,,,
00:20:10.200,00:20:10.800,还有戏,,,
00:20:12.320,00:20:14.640,那么从台湾民主发展的教训中,00:20:12.320,00:20:14.640,"From the lessons of Taiwan’s democratic development,"
00:20:14.640,00:20:15.840,我觉得可以,,,
00:20:16.080,00:20:17.440,引出那么几点思考,00:20:14.640,00:20:17.440,I believe it leads to a few thoughts.
00:20:17.440,00:20:19.680,首先就是我们一定要突破西方,00:20:17.440,00:20:21.800,"Firstly, we must break through the Western narrative."
00:20:19.680,00:20:20.200,主导的,,,
00:20:20.920,00:20:21.800,话语范式,,,
00:20:21.840,00:20:22.480,也就是说,,,
00:20:22.520,00:20:22.880,世界上,,,
00:20:22.920,00:20:24.880,只有民主和专制两种制度,00:20:21.840,00:20:25.400,They say there are only two types of systems in the world: democracy and autocracy.
00:20:24.920,00:20:27.200,这种饭是不能成立的,00:20:25.400,00:20:27.540,This narrative does not hold.
00:20:27.520,00:20:29.000,如果一定要用两分法,,,
00:20:29.000,00:20:30.280,来看世界上制度,00:20:27.540,00:20:30.940,"If we must use a dichotomy to look at the systems in the world,"
00:20:30.280,00:20:32.000,那么我一贯讲的,,,
00:20:32.000,00:20:33.680,实际上只有量质格嘎,00:20:30.940,00:20:35.820,then I would say the difference is only between good governance and bad governance.
00:20:33.720,00:20:34.320,不能,,,
00:20:34.360,00:20:35.400,和劣质bag,,,
00:20:35.400,00:20:38.280,不能是这个分析框架,00:20:36.340,00:20:39.400,This analysis framework is more fact-based.
00:20:38.320,00:20:39.400,更加实事求是,,,
00:20:39.400,00:20:41.640,我想最终会成为世界的主流,00:20:39.400,00:20:42.000,I believe it will eventually become the mainstream of the world.
00:20:42.320,00:20:44.760,第二点就是台湾在两蒋时期,00:20:42.320,00:20:46.400,"Secondly, Chinese traditional culture and historical education"
00:20:44.880,00:20:47.160,毕竟中国的传统文化,,,
00:20:47.200,00:20:48.320,和历史教育,00:20:46.400,00:20:49.560,were not interrupted in Taiwan during the two Chiangs period.
00:20:48.360,00:20:49.280,没有中断,,,
00:20:49.800,00:20:51.680,但现在台独势力操纵下,00:20:49.740,00:20:53.380,"But now it is increasingly disrupted under
the manipulation of Taiwan separatists."
00:20:51.680,00:20:52.920,也日益中断,,,
00:20:53.480,00:20:55.600,台湾民间社会相当时间内,,,
00:20:55.640,00:20:58.080,还是比较温良恭俭让的一种社会,00:20:53.480,00:20:58.280,"Taiwan's civil society inherited good qualities
""gentle, kind, respectful, thrifty, and tolerant."""
00:20:58.080,00:21:00.240,但现在确实越来越分裂了,00:20:58.280,00:21:00.240,But now it is getting more and more divided.
00:21:00.280,00:21:01.440,这十分可惜的,00:21:00.280,00:21:01.620,It's a pity.
00:21:01.680,00:21:02.720,我想当初,,,
00:21:02.840,00:21:05.520,如果台湾没有照搬美国民主模式,00:21:01.680,00:21:05.520,"What would happen if Taiwan had not copied the American democratic model,"
00:21:05.520,00:21:07.200,而是按照中国传统文化的,00:21:05.520,00:21:08.640,but had developed in accordance with the logic of Chinese traditional culture?
00:21:07.200,00:21:08.480,逻辑发展下去,,,
00:21:08.480,00:21:10.880,同时吸收西方制度中的,00:21:08.640,00:21:12.440,"In the meantime, if it also absorbed some reasonable elements from Western system,"
00:21:10.880,00:21:12.400,某些合理元素,,,
00:21:12.520,00:21:14.360,也许台湾可以发展出,,,
00:21:14.400,00:21:14.840,一种,00:21:12.440,00:21:16.900,perhaps Taiwan could have developed a higher-quality consultative democracy
00:21:14.840,00:21:16.880,更高质量的协商式的民主,,,
00:21:16.920,00:21:20.000,而不是对抗式的美式民族I一种,00:21:17.080,00:21:19.840,rather than a confrontational American democracy.
00:21:20.000,00:21:21.440,民生导向的民族,,,
00:21:21.440,00:21:22.600,而不是白切问题,,,
00:21:22.600,00:21:25.200,都政治化的这种美式的民族,00:21:19.840,00:21:25.640,"A livelihood-oriented democracy, rather than an American democracy that politicizes all issues."
00:21:25.600,00:21:26.960,我想台湾已经,,,
00:21:26.960,00:21:28.560,而且将继续为自己,,,
00:21:28.560,00:21:30.080,当初不明智的选择,00:21:25.640,00:21:32.080,I think Taiwan has paid a heavy price for its unwise choices and will continue to do so.
00:21:30.080,00:21:31.640,付出沉重的代价,,,
00:21:32.600,00:21:36.520,第三点是以台湾地区作为参照,00:21:32.600,00:21:36.520,"Thirdly, using the Taiwan area as a reference,"
00:21:36.560,00:21:37.560,我们可以看到,,,
00:21:37.760,00:21:39.360,中国自己的中国道路,00:21:36.560,00:21:41.520,we can see our own path and model has a bright future.
00:21:39.400,00:21:41.640,中国模式前途非常光明,,,
00:21:41.760,00:21:43.040,那么30年前,,,
00:21:43.200,00:21:44.360,台湾感觉良好,00:21:41.760,00:21:44.640,"Thirty years ago, Taiwan felt so good about itself."
00:21:44.360,00:21:46.760,而大陆经济才刚刚开始起飞,00:21:44.640,00:21:47.000,"When the mainland economy just began to take off,"
00:21:47.200,00:21:49.240,台湾方面已经先走了一步,00:21:47.200,00:21:49.240,Taiwan had already taken a step ahead.
00:21:49.400,00:21:51.120,但今天大陆台湾实力,,,
00:21:51.120,00:21:53.080,发生了翻天覆地的变化,00:21:49.400,00:21:52.940,"but today, the strength of mainland of Taiwan has undergone enormous changes:"
00:21:53.120,00:21:54.640,大陆迅速崛起,,,
00:21:54.680,00:21:56.160,台湾迅速走衰,00:21:53.120,00:21:56.220,The mainland has risen rapidly and Taiwan quickly declined.
00:21:56.560,00:21:58.120,那么中国模式的一个特点,,,
00:21:58.120,00:21:59.760,是可以制定和执行,00:21:56.560,00:22:00.180,A feature of China's model is that it can formulate and implement policies and plans
00:21:59.760,00:22:02.800,符合自己长远利益的政策和规划,00:22:00.180,00:22:02.800,that are in line with long-term interests.
00:22:03.480,00:22:05.160,中国一系列五年规划的,00:22:03.480,00:22:06.640,The stable formulation and implementation of a series of five-year plans
00:22:05.160,00:22:06.640,顺利制定和执行,,,
00:22:06.880,00:22:08.560,奠定了中国崛起的基础,00:22:06.880,00:22:08.560,laid the foundation for China's rise.
00:22:09.000,00:22:10.680,而台湾的民主化之后,00:22:09.000,00:22:10.680,"However, after Taiwan’s “democratization”,"
00:22:10.680,00:22:12.880,就丧失了中长期规划,00:22:10.680,00:22:14.440,it lost the mid-term to long-term capability to design and execute plans.
00:22:12.880,00:22:14.440,和执行规划的能力,,,
00:22:14.920,00:22:16.240,另外在政治方面,,,
00:22:16.240,00:22:17.200,西方模式讲,00:22:14.920,00:22:17.980,"Also, in terms of politics, the Western model highlights 'one person, one vote'"
00:22:17.200,00:22:18.160,一人一票,,,
00:22:18.200,00:22:20.280,中国模式讲选贤任能,00:22:18.200,00:22:20.280,while the Chinese model emphasizes meritocracy.
00:22:20.400,00:22:21.720,两者可以竞争,00:22:20.400,00:22:21.860,The two methods can compete.
00:22:21.720,00:22:23.360,今天是新媒体时代,00:22:21.860,00:22:23.420,"In the era of new media,"
00:22:23.360,00:22:25.920,西方民主模式变得越来越明确,00:22:23.420,00:22:27.160,Western democratic models are becoming more populist and gamified.
00:22:25.960,00:22:27.240,越来越游戏化,,,
00:22:27.280,00:22:29.360,越来越难产生优秀的领导人,00:22:27.160,00:22:29.500,It's increasingly difficult to produce good leaders.
00:22:29.560,00:22:31.600,两岸实力的此长彼消,00:22:29.560,00:22:32.880,The trend of changing powers across the strait is irreversible.
00:22:31.600,00:22:32.880,已不可逆转,,,
00:22:32.880,00:22:35.040,我记得上次在谈到香港问题的,00:22:32.880,00:22:36.480,"I remember that when I talked about the Hong Kong issue last time, I said:"
00:22:35.040,00:22:35.280,时候,,,
00:22:35.280,00:22:36.480,我讲过这么一番话,,,
00:22:36.480,00:22:38.960,我说如果香港的资本主义制度不,00:22:36.480,00:22:39.960,"If Hong Kong's capitalist system refuses to reform,"
00:22:38.960,00:22:39.960,思改革,,,
00:22:40.320,00:22:42.320,香港可能真的会沉沦下去,,,
00:22:42.320,00:22:43.960,给香港人民的利益,00:22:40.320,00:22:45.340,Hong Kong may sink and cause significant harm to the interests of Hong Kong people.
00:22:43.960,00:22:45.800,造成极大的伤害,,,
00:22:45.920,00:22:47.680,尽管我们非常不愿意看到这种,00:22:45.920,00:22:48.400,We're very reluctant to see this.
00:22:47.680,00:22:48.400,情景,,,
00:22:48.640,00:22:51.480,但我不排除香港最终会成为,00:22:48.640,00:22:51.180,"Still, I do not exclude the possibility that"
00:22:51.640,00:22:53.480,大陆人民道路自信,,,
00:22:53.520,00:22:55.360,制度自信的一个教育基地,00:22:51.300,00:22:56.020,Hong Kong will eventually become an education base to raise confidence in the mainland model and system.
00:22:55.840,00:22:57.320,一个好端端的城市,,,
00:22:57.320,00:22:58.920,在资本主义制度下,,,
00:22:58.960,00:23:00.080,不思改革,00:22:56.020,00:23:02.920,"This successful city, which refuses reforms and lost its ability to reform, will sink all the way."
00:23:00.120,00:23:01.120,也无法改革,,,
00:23:01.120,00:23:02.920,最终一路沉沦下去,,,
00:23:03.360,00:23:04.720,就像台湾事实上,,,
00:23:04.720,00:23:06.600,已经成为这样一个教育基地,00:23:03.360,00:23:06.600,Just like Taiwan - it has already become such an education base.
00:23:06.880,00:23:09.480,希望香港不要步台湾的后尘,00:23:06.880,00:23:09.480,I hope Hong Kong will not become another.
00:23:10.160,00:23:13.520,总之今天台湾迫切需要政治改革,00:23:10.160,00:23:13.520,"In short, Taiwan urgently needs political reform today."
00:23:13.520,00:23:15.640,否则台湾将继续走衰,00:23:13.520,00:23:15.640,"Otherwise, it will continue to decline."
00:23:15.680,00:23:17.360,我们希望台湾能够推动,00:23:15.680,00:23:18.840,"We hope that Taiwan can promote substantive political reforms,"
00:23:17.360,00:23:18.840,实质性的政治改革,,,
00:23:18.840,00:23:21.280,希望两岸人民越走越近,00:23:18.840,00:23:21.280,"that the people on both sides of the strait will keep going closer,"
00:23:21.400,00:23:24.240,希望两岸能够实现共同繁荣,00:23:21.400,00:23:24.240,"that the two sides of the strait can achieve common prosperity,"
00:23:24.240,00:23:26.920,希望最终能够实现国家统一,00:23:24.240,00:23:26.920,and that our county can eventually be unified.
00:23:27.040,00:23:28.000,我也相信,,,
00:23:28.000,00:23:30.520,这是不可逆转的历史大事,00:23:27.040,00:23:30.340,I also believe that this is an irreversible historical trend.
00:23:30.640,00:23:30.960,好,,,
00:23:30.960,00:23:32.200,今天就跟大家说这些,,,
00:23:32.200,00:23:33.480,谢谢大家,00:23:30.960,00:23:34.000,"Okay, that's all for my speech today.
Thank you."
00:23:35.120,00:23:35.720,特别,,,
00:23:37.160,00:23:37.320,好,,,
00:23:37.320,00:23:39.440,谢谢张教授给出的一段演讲,00:23:37.320,00:23:39.440,"Thank you, Professor Zhang, for the keynote."
00:23:39.440,00:23:40.200,对台湾问题,,,
00:23:40.240,00:23:41.600,有了一个深刻的解剖,00:23:39.440,00:23:41.600,It gives a deep analysis of the Taiwan issue.
00:23:41.640,00:23:43.920,接下来我们马上有请黄智贤女士,00:23:41.640,00:23:43.920,"Next, let’s welcome Ms. Huang Zhixian."
00:23:44.040,00:23:45.080,来自台湾地区,00:23:44.040,00:23:45.160,"You come from Taiwan,"
00:23:45.080,00:23:46.600,您眼中的台湾又是怎样,00:23:45.160,00:23:46.600,What is Taiwan like in your eyes?
00:23:46.640,00:23:47.360,有请,00:23:46.640,00:23:47.360,Please.
00:23:47.400,00:23:48.280,谢谢主持人,00:23:47.400,00:23:48.620,Thank you.
00:23:52.680,00:23:53.440,6月的时候,,,
00:23:53.480,00:23:54.520,我在厦门,00:23:52.680,00:23:54.520,"When I was in Xiamen in June [2019],"
00:23:54.760,00:23:55.600,当我讲,00:23:54.760,00:23:55.600,I said that
00:23:55.960,00:23:56.800,我们这一代,,,
00:23:56.840,00:23:58.520,要把台湾带回家,00:23:55.960,00:23:58.520,our generation would bring Taiwan home.
00:23:58.960,00:23:59.400,为什么,,,
00:23:59.400,00:24:01.400,我可以有这样的底气呢,00:23:58.960,00:24:01.400,Why was I so confident?
00:24:01.720,00:24:02.960,因为我觉得,00:24:01.720,00:24:04.400,Because I know what I see now
00:24:03.400,00:24:05.200,我知道我所看到的,,,
00:24:05.960,00:24:07.520,未来会看到的事实,00:24:04.400,00:24:07.520,is waht I will see in the future.
00:24:08.040,00:24:09.880,我们小时候成长的时候,,,
00:24:10.040,00:24:12.400,所有的台湾人都觉得自己是中国,00:24:08.040,00:24:12.060,"When my generation grew up, all Taiwanese identified Chinese."
00:24:12.400,00:24:12.800,人,,,
00:24:12.800,00:24:14.960,99.9999%,00:24:12.920,00:24:14.960,99.9999%.
00:24:15.040,00:24:15.840,我们每天想,,,
00:24:15.920,00:24:16.960,我们成长的过程,00:24:15.040,00:24:17.760,"When we were growing up, we were always thinking"
00:24:17.000,00:24:17.760,一直在想,,,
00:24:17.840,00:24:19.440,我们要怎么样让我们,,,
00:24:20.080,00:24:22.840,中国能够复兴我们中国人,00:24:17.820,00:24:21.660,"how we can rejuvenate China,"
00:24:22.840,00:24:25.320,能够变成最伟大的国家,00:24:21.660,00:24:25.320,"how we can make China the greatest country,"
00:24:25.320,00:24:26.520,我们要如何才能够,,,
00:24:26.520,00:24:29.200,解救苦难的大陆同胞,00:24:25.320,00:24:29.280,"and how can we ""rescue"" our mainland compatriots who were ""suffering""?"
00:24:29.440,00:24:31.200,每天想我们应该革命,00:24:29.440,00:24:32.400,"Every day, we thought about whether we need revolutions or reforms."
00:24:31.200,00:24:32.400,还是应该改革,,,
00:24:32.640,00:24:34.280,我们这一代的知识分子,00:24:32.640,00:24:34.960,This is how the intellectuals of our generation are.
00:24:34.280,00:24:34.960,是这样,,,
00:24:35.080,00:24:36.920,可是因为那是我们读的教科书,00:24:35.080,00:24:38.420,"Because at that time, our textbooks told us since we were very young"
00:24:36.920,00:24:38.520,从小就是告诉我们,,,
00:24:38.560,00:24:39.640,我们就中国人,00:24:38.560,00:24:40.100,that we are Chinese -
00:24:40.360,00:24:41.600,从北京人开始,00:24:40.320,00:24:42.560,all the dynasties back to the ancient Peking Man.
00:24:41.600,00:24:42.360,然后每个朝代,,,
00:24:42.360,00:24:44.120,当然背的时候恨得要死,00:24:42.560,00:24:44.700,"Although we hated to memorize the facts,"
00:24:44.240,00:24:44.920,可是,,,
00:24:45.440,00:24:47.120,教科书就好像是,,,
00:24:47.200,00:24:49.440,电脑硬体里面的软体,00:24:44.700,00:24:49.720,textbooks are like the software on a computer:
00:24:49.760,00:24:51.360,你把它种进去以后,,,
00:24:51.360,00:24:54.920,它就会变成按照软体的指示去做,00:24:49.720,00:24:54.920,"once installed, it will follow the instructions of the program."
00:24:55.280,00:24:56.160,你想想看,00:24:55.280,00:24:56.480,Think about this:
00:24:56.200,00:24:58.960,当李登辉在90年代初,,,
00:24:59.000,00:24:59.560,开始,,,
00:24:59.560,00:25:01.800,用中国国民党的位置,00:24:56.480,00:25:05.220,when Lee Teng-hui used his power as the KMT president and the leader of Taiwan in early 1990s
00:25:01.800,00:25:03.040,国民党主席,,,
00:25:03.040,00:25:05.720,而且加上台湾领导人这个位置,,,
00:25:05.880,00:25:08.560,然后来做第1本的台独教科书,00:25:05.880,00:25:08.560,"to make the first ""Taiwan independence"" textbook."
00:25:08.560,00:25:11.360,那个时候他找了民进党的人,00:25:08.560,00:25:11.360,"At that time, he invited DPP members"
00:25:11.400,00:25:13.440,在他办公室里面开香槟,00:25:11.400,00:25:13.440,to open champagnes in his office.
00:25:13.640,00:25:14.640,他说,,,
00:25:15.000,00:25:16.600,教科书一出以后,00:25:13.640,00:25:16.600,"He said that ""In 20 years after we publish this textbook,"""
00:25:17.000,00:25:18.680,二十年后,,,
00:25:18.680,00:25:20.520,扛着台湾人,00:25:17.000,00:25:22.920,"""all the Taiwanese people will always be our people even if we do nothing at all."""
00:25:20.520,00:25:22.920,永远都是我们的人,,,
00:25:22.960,00:25:23.960,你想想看,00:25:22.960,00:25:24.300,It is simple math:
00:25:23.960,00:25:25.480,90年代初,,,
00:25:25.480,00:25:28.080,那个时候念初中一年级的人,00:25:24.300,00:25:28.080,people who began their junior high school in early 1990s
00:25:28.080,00:25:30.840,现在三十岁,00:25:28.080,00:25:30.840,are now in their thirties.
00:25:30.840,00:25:33.440,所以台湾最近在做民调,,,
00:25:33.480,00:25:36.120,三十岁以下的台湾人,00:25:30.840,00:25:36.600,"Therefore, a recent poll in Taiwan shows that 85 % of people under 30"
00:25:37.160,00:25:40.360,8×5认为自己是台湾人,00:25:36.600,00:25:41.520,"consider themselves Taiwanese, not Chinese."
00:25:40.360,00:25:41.520,不是中国人,,,
00:25:42.080,00:25:43.720,现在台湾的大学毕业生,,,
00:25:43.760,00:25:45.560,已经不知道诸葛亮是谁了,00:25:42.080,00:25:45.520,"College graduates in Taiwan no longer
know who Zhuge Liang is"
00:25:45.680,00:25:46.840,因为它的教科书里面,00:25:45.680,00:25:47.720,because they don't have it in their textbooks.
00:25:46.880,00:25:48.680,没有所谓的,,,
00:25:48.680,00:25:50.960,口口声声台湾讲的民主,00:25:47.720,00:25:50.960,"They are saying democracy in Taiwan all the time,"
00:25:51.040,00:25:53.280,民主不是人民做主吗,00:25:51.040,00:25:53.280,"but isn't democracy ""having the people making the decisions""."
00:25:53.440,00:25:54.880,他都不告诉你,,,
00:25:54.880,00:25:56.520,民主是可以操控的,00:25:53.440,00:25:56.340,"No, they do not tell you that democracy can be manipulated."
00:25:56.520,00:25:57.640,为什么很多学者,00:25:56.520,00:25:58.660,Why so many Western scholars start
00:25:57.680,00:25:58.360,西方的学者,,,
00:25:58.360,00:25:59.680,现在开始思考,,,
00:25:59.880,00:26:01.600,民主的终结,00:25:58.660,00:26:01.600,thinking about the end of democracy?
00:26:01.600,00:26:04.520,因为你实施一人一票普选之后,00:26:01.600,00:26:04.520,"Because after the implementation of
'one-person, one-vote' suffrage,"
00:26:04.520,00:26:07.120,到最后有钱的人,00:26:04.520,00:26:09.080,"the rich people can finally buy votes with money,"
00:26:07.120,00:26:09.080,金钱就可以买到选票,,,
00:26:09.120,00:26:11.560,因为全台湾,00:26:09.120,00:26:12.400,"because in Taiwan and the United States,"
00:26:11.880,00:26:14.600,美国除了欧洲少数地方以外,00:26:12.400,00:26:14.600,"and most places in Europe,"
00:26:14.600,00:26:16.240,大部分的媒体,,,
00:26:16.240,00:26:17.600,绝大部分的媒体,00:26:14.600,00:26:20.080,most of the media are controlled by capital.
00:26:17.600,00:26:20.080,都掌控在资本家手里,,,
00:26:20.560,00:26:22.240,你有钱就可以买个报纸,00:26:20.560,00:26:22.740,I can buy newspapers.
00:26:23.120,00:26:24.760,然后买报纸还不高兴,,,
00:26:24.760,00:26:26.480,我再买两个电视台,00:26:23.460,00:26:26.820,"And then I can also buy two TV channels,"
00:26:26.920,00:26:27.920,广播电台,00:26:26.940,00:26:28.100,"a radio channel,"
00:26:28.200,00:26:29.960,然后网络平台,00:26:28.200,00:26:29.960,and online platforms.
00:26:30.200,00:26:31.280,我多少钱,,,
00:26:31.280,00:26:32.400,我就可以买多少,00:26:30.200,00:26:32.400,"I can buy as many as possible,"
00:26:32.440,00:26:34.600,然后我就可以决定要怎么样,00:26:32.440,00:26:34.600,and then I can decide what to promote.
00:26:34.600,00:26:35.720,然后影响议员,00:26:34.600,00:26:35.720,I can also affect the MPs
00:26:35.760,00:26:36.840,因为议员要当选,,,
00:26:36.840,00:26:38.520,他需要露面,00:26:35.760,00:26:38.460,because they need to make appearances to be elected.
00:26:38.520,00:26:39.640,然后他需要沟通,,,
00:26:39.640,00:26:40.680,他需要广告,00:26:38.520,00:26:40.860,They need to communicate and advertise.
00:26:40.720,00:26:42.640,然后这些议员不听我的话,00:26:40.860,00:26:42.640,"If the MPs are not obedient,"
00:26:42.640,00:26:43.720,我就不让你上电视,00:26:42.640,00:26:43.720,they will not be allowed to appear on TV.
00:26:43.720,00:26:44.960,这些议员,,,
00:26:44.960,00:26:47.360,你胆敢去帮助我的对手,00:26:43.720,00:26:47.360,"If the MPs dare to help my opponents,"
00:26:47.480,00:26:49.440,我就每天报纸修理你,00:26:47.480,00:26:49.440,my newspaper will criticize them every day.
00:26:49.920,00:26:50.040,你,,,
00:26:50.080,00:26:50.600,想干哪,00:26:49.760,00:26:51.660,That was how they did it back then.
00:26:52.000,00:26:55.240,一个民主制度设计的困境,00:26:51.700,00:26:54.940,This is a dilemma in democratic system design -
00:26:56.480,00:26:58.680,尤其在台湾特别彰显,00:26:56.480,00:26:58.680,especially obvious in Taiwan.
00:26:58.800,00:27:01.200,你必须看到五年十年,,,
00:27:01.240,00:27:02.720,二十年之后,00:26:58.800,00:27:04.160,"You have to look 5, 10, and 20 years ahead."
00:27:02.760,00:27:04.160,会是什么样子,,,
00:27:04.200,00:27:06.240,而当五年十年,00:27:04.200,00:27:07.400,"But after 5, 10, or 20 years,"
00:27:06.240,00:27:06.640,十五年,,,
00:27:06.640,00:27:07.400,二十年之后,,,
00:27:07.400,00:27:09.840,我执政的人我已经下台了,00:27:07.400,00:27:09.840,this ruler is no longer in office.
00:27:09.960,00:27:11.440,台湾在日本时代,00:27:09.960,00:27:12.140,"When Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule,"
00:27:11.480,00:27:12.560,日据时代,,,
00:27:12.560,00:27:14.920,85%的农民,00:27:12.140,00:27:17.120,85% of the farmers in Taiwan were tenant farmers with no land.
00:27:14.920,00:27:16.080,都是佃农,,,
00:27:16.120,00:27:17.120,都没有土地,,,
00:27:17.120,00:27:19.040,等到两蒋回来之后,00:27:17.120,00:27:19.460,"After the ""two Chiangs"" came back,"
00:27:19.480,00:27:21.560,几乎三等佃农,00:27:19.460,00:27:22.500,almost all the third-class tenant farmers and poor households
00:27:21.560,00:27:22.560,三等评户,,,
00:27:22.600,00:27:24.000,都有自己的米饭吃,,,
00:27:24.040,00:27:25.240,都有自己的土,00:27:22.600,00:27:25.500,"had their rice to eat, and they all had their land."
00:27:25.240,00:27:26.600,包括陈水扁他们家,00:27:25.560,00:27:27.520,Chen Shui-bian's family was one of them:
00:27:27.400,00:27:28.640,佃农出身,00:27:27.520,00:27:29.460,he was born in a tenant farmer family and
00:27:28.640,00:27:30.800,就是靠着两讲,,,
00:27:30.800,00:27:31.760,然后开始给你,00:27:29.460,00:27:32.440,obtained some land thanks to the policy.
00:27:31.800,00:27:32.440,土地了,,,
00:27:32.800,00:27:34.840,然后开始强迫教育,00:27:32.800,00:27:35.000,"The ""two Chiangs"" began obligational education."
00:27:34.880,00:27:37.080,然后让穷困的小孩子,00:27:35.000,00:27:38.520,So that poor children could go to the military and public school.
00:27:37.120,00:27:38.520,他可以去考军公教,,,
00:27:38.560,00:27:40.600,所以陈水扁他的姐姐们,00:27:38.560,00:27:41.700,Chen Shui-bian's sisters all passed exams to be teachers
00:27:40.600,00:27:42.000,都是去考老师,,,
00:27:42.040,00:27:42.760,出来以后,,,
00:27:42.760,00:27:43.760,他就终身职,00:27:42.040,00:27:45.180,and they had life-time employment.
00:27:43.760,00:27:44.480,终身俸,,,
00:27:44.480,00:27:45.600,他一辈子吃喝不愁,,,
00:27:45.640,00:27:47.160,他一袋他就翻身了,00:27:45.180,00:27:47.160,It only took one generation to change a family's life.
00:27:47.160,00:27:49.880,然后开始发展纺织业,,,
00:27:49.880,00:27:50.840,轻工业,00:27:47.160,00:27:52.840,"Taiwan then began to develop textile and light industry, as well as electronics industries."
00:27:50.840,00:27:52.840,然后电子业,,,
00:27:53.200,00:27:56.360,一每一步其实都跟西方的,00:27:53.200,00:27:58.640,Every step was contrary to Western theories.
00:27:56.760,00:27:58.640,理论是方相反,,,
00:27:59.160,00:28:00.440,都是政府在看,,,
00:28:00.440,00:28:03.480,说我现在我需要高速公路,00:27:59.160,00:28:03.180,"For example, the government found they need to build highways."
00:28:03.480,00:28:04.800,它要盖高速公路的时候,,,
00:28:04.800,00:28:07.480,当时所有的人都是反对的,00:28:03.480,00:28:07.480,"When the construction started,  everyone opposed it."
00:28:07.560,00:28:09.400,车街上没有几部车,00:28:07.560,00:28:09.500,"""There are barely any cars on the streets."""
00:28:09.440,00:28:10.160,你开高速公路,,,
00:28:10.160,00:28:11.880,都是给有钱人开的,00:28:09.500,00:28:12.160,"""Highways are for the rich."""
00:28:12.240,00:28:12.760,好,,,
00:28:13.240,00:28:15.680,如果是以台湾现在的制度,00:28:13.320,00:28:17.800,"If this was in Taiwan's current system,
they would never be able to build any highway."
00:28:16.960,00:28:17.040,对,,,
00:28:17.040,00:28:18.000,盖不了高速登陆,,,
00:28:18.040,00:28:20.400,台湾现在一定还在推牛车,00:28:18.040,00:28:21.420,"Taiwanese would still be pushing ox-wagons, I'm sure."
00:28:20.840,00:28:21.600,绝对,,,
00:28:21.600,00:28:22.880,因为每个人都反对,00:28:21.600,00:28:23.640,Because everyone is opposed to it.
00:28:23.560,00:28:25.760,所以民主内在的一个困局,00:28:23.640,00:28:26.500,"Therefore, the inner dilemma of democracy is"
00:28:25.760,00:28:27.720,是绝大多数的,,,
00:28:27.760,00:28:29.840,人对于很,00:28:26.500,00:28:30.800,that most people really have no time or ability
00:28:29.880,00:28:31.440,复杂的一个法案,,,
00:28:31.600,00:28:32.840,他真的没有时间,00:28:30.800,00:28:34.580,to understand a complicated plan or policy.
00:28:32.840,00:28:34.240,真的没有能力了解,,,
00:28:34.240,00:28:37.440,我在台湾念最好的高中北一女,00:28:34.580,00:28:37.600,"I was studying at Taipei First Girls High School, the best high school."
00:28:37.600,00:28:40.400,那个时候家父就希望我能够读一,00:28:37.600,00:28:40.520,My father wanted me to study medicine.
00:28:40.720,00:28:42.200,我一直想读中文,00:28:40.720,00:28:42.640,"However, my interest was always in Chinese."
00:28:42.200,00:28:43.720,就后来家父就说,,,
00:28:43.920,00:28:45.360,你不然就不要读,00:28:42.640,00:28:45.360,"My father told me ""either medicine or quit""."
00:28:45.480,00:28:47.600,那是后来我就辍学以后,00:28:45.480,00:28:47.240,So I dropped out of school.
00:28:47.600,00:28:49.440,我在台湾打工,00:28:47.600,00:28:50.320,"Since then, I worked for seven years."
00:28:49.440,00:28:50.320,打了七年,,,
00:28:50.320,00:28:53.040,我去端盘子当油漆工,00:28:50.540,00:28:53.040,"I worked as a house painter, served dishes,"
00:28:53.040,00:28:54.280,我开过计程车,00:28:53.040,00:28:54.800,"drove a taxi,"
00:28:54.320,00:28:54.800,车,,,
00:28:54.800,00:28:55.160,然后,,,
00:28:55.240,00:28:57.480,做过各种各样的餐厅,00:28:54.800,00:28:57.480,and worked in all kinds of restaurants.
00:28:57.480,00:28:59.120,这样子存了钱之后,00:28:57.580,00:28:59.220,"After I made enough money,"
00:28:59.160,00:29:00.600,我到美国去念大学,00:28:59.220,00:29:00.780,I went to university in the United States.
00:29:00.880,00:29:01.640,继续打工,00:29:00.880,00:29:02.540,"I was also working part-time,"
00:29:02.200,00:29:02.840,然后,,,
00:29:02.880,00:29:03.720,念完大学的,,,
00:29:03.760,00:29:04.760,以后就跑到1,00:29:02.540,00:29:06.440,and then went to the UK for a master's degree.
00:29:04.800,00:29:06.440,英国去念硕士,,,
00:29:06.600,00:29:08.000,我在社会的底层,00:29:06.600,00:29:08.000,I was always working at the bottom of society.
00:29:08.000,00:29:09.400,在台湾打工,,,
00:29:09.400,00:29:10.400,在美国打工,00:29:08.000,00:29:11.400,"I worked in Taiwan,  the US, and the UK."
00:29:10.440,00:29:11.120,在英国打工,,,
00:29:11.120,00:29:12.000,我知道,,,
00:29:12.040,00:29:12.640,当你每天,,,
00:29:12.640,00:29:15.160,在为社会生活奔忙的时候,00:29:11.400,00:29:15.000,"I know that when you are busy making a living,"
00:29:15.440,00:29:17.280,我听不懂讲什么,00:29:15.000,00:29:17.300,you won't understand what politicians are talking about.
00:29:17.600,00:29:19.400,但如果我还对政治有兴趣,00:29:17.600,00:29:19.500,If I am still interested in politics
00:29:19.400,00:29:20.480,我要那一天投票,,,
00:29:20.480,00:29:20.600,说,,,
00:29:20.600,00:29:22.200,我要去投一票的时候,00:29:19.500,00:29:22.200,"and I want to cast a vote,"
00:29:22.400,00:29:23.840,我根据什么投票,00:29:22.400,00:29:24.760,what do I base my vote on?
00:29:23.840,00:29:24.760,就,,,
00:29:25.160,00:29:26.520,这个女生好漂亮,00:29:25.160,00:29:27.840,This girl is so beautiful and you feel an affinity with her first sight.
00:29:26.880,00:29:27.880,好有眼缘,,,
00:29:28.000,00:29:30.160,所以台湾有一种选票叫朱哥票,00:29:28.000,00:29:30.720,"Some Taiwanese cast ""the pig brother votes""."
00:29:31.280,00:29:32.000,政党推出,,,
00:29:32.040,00:29:34.200,很漂亮的年轻的女生,00:29:31.280,00:29:34.200,"Political parties send out beautiful young girls,"
00:29:34.200,00:29:36.320,然后爱他请投我一票,00:29:34.200,00:29:36.340,and they appeal to people to vote for her.
00:29:36.600,00:29:37.280,祝哥们就,,,
00:29:37.320,00:29:37.880,来了,00:29:36.600,00:29:38.240,"The ""pig brothers"" come,"
00:29:38.400,00:29:38.960,我投他一票,,,
00:29:38.960,00:29:39.320,他就,00:29:38.340,00:29:40.080,vote for her and she will be elected.
00:29:39.400,00:29:40.040,选了,,,
00:29:40.200,00:29:40.960,或者是说,,,
00:29:40.960,00:29:42.400,我要让你印象深刻,00:29:40.200,00:29:43.040,"In other words, if I want to impress you and make you remember me,"
00:29:42.400,00:29:44.160,记得我就要走偏锋,00:29:43.200,00:29:45.420,I have to make an unexpected move and get media coverage.
00:29:45.080,00:29:45.200,对,,,
00:29:45.280,00:29:46.360,然后媒体就来报道,,,
00:29:46.360,00:29:47.720,所以为什么大家要打架,00:29:45.420,00:29:47.720,That's why people start fights - because the media will report.
00:29:47.720,00:29:49.400,或者说白天打一打,00:29:47.720,00:29:50.940,"Sometimes they fight during the day,
and drink together at night."
00:29:49.400,00:29:51.360,然后晚上大家继续喝酒,,,
00:29:51.440,00:29:52.840,那也都是为什么,00:29:51.440,00:29:52.960,That's all true. But why?
00:29:53.000,00:29:54.880,因为我们有共同的利益,00:29:52.960,00:29:55.200,Because we have common interests.
00:29:55.080,00:29:57.600,我们打是我代表国民党,00:29:55.200,00:29:59.200,We fight as I represent the KMT and you represent the DPP.
00:29:57.800,00:29:59.200,你代表民进党,,,
00:29:59.480,00:30:01.560,你民进党有一些支持台独的人,00:29:59.480,00:30:01.560,"There are some pro-independence  members of DPP,"
00:30:01.600,00:30:02.840,所以你要演给他看,,,
00:30:03.000,00:30:04.400,说你很努力要台独,00:30:01.600,00:30:04.940,"so they have to show that they're working hard for  ""Taiwan independence."""
00:30:05.200,00:30:06.280,我是国民党,,,
00:30:06.360,00:30:08.480,所以我要骂民进党,00:30:05.020,00:30:08.300,"And as a member of KMT, I need to criticize DPP."
00:30:08.560,00:30:09.120,好,,,
00:30:09.120,00:30:10.120,然后记者摆好,00:30:08.560,00:30:10.600,"Okay, once the reporters have set up the cameras,"
00:30:10.160,00:30:11.720,Tm让了来我们来答,00:30:10.600,00:30:11.980,our fight starts.
00:30:12.440,00:30:13.080,打完以后,00:30:12.440,00:30:13.460,"After the show,"
00:30:13.480,00:30:15.000,可是我们还是有一些法案,00:30:13.480,00:30:15.480,we still have some bills to review.
00:30:15.800,00:30:18.680,我的金主跟你的金主是同一个,00:30:15.800,00:30:18.680,My funder might be the same as yours.
00:30:18.760,00:30:19.720,你知道吗,,,
00:30:19.720,00:30:22.120,在台湾有很多很好笑的事情是,00:30:18.760,00:30:22.200,"You may not know this, but there are so many ridiculous things in Taiwan."
00:30:22.360,00:30:24.440,国民党跟民进党的金主,00:30:22.360,00:30:25.400,The KMT and DPP share the same funder.
00:30:24.440,00:30:25.400,是同一个人,,,
00:30:25.640,00:30:26.440,我是企业家,00:30:25.460,00:30:27.340,"For example, I am a rich entrepreneur."
00:30:26.440,00:30:27.120,我有钱,,,
00:30:27.120,00:30:28.840,我给国民党300万,00:30:27.340,00:30:28.840,I pay the KMT 3 million
00:30:28.840,00:30:30.240,我给民进党500万,00:30:28.840,00:30:30.240,and DPP 5 million
00:30:30.280,00:30:31.600,我给亲民党100万,00:30:30.280,00:30:31.600,and People First Party 1 million
00:30:31.600,00:30:33.960,我给谁的我全都买,00:30:31.600,00:30:33.880,and some amount for some party - I buy them all!
00:30:34.040,00:30:35.480,所以我黄智贤,,,
00:30:35.480,00:30:36.680,我要通过的法案,,,
00:30:36.680,00:30:39.520,你们大家都多乖一点,00:30:34.040,00:30:39.580,"So when I want to pass a bill, you better all behave."
00:30:40.240,00:30:41.920,可玩真的吵吵闹闹,00:30:39.580,00:30:41.400,Don't really review it.
00:30:41.960,00:30:43.960,一定要过I三天以后要过,00:30:41.500,00:30:44.380,"You can make some noise but the bill
must pass in no more than 3 days."
00:30:44.920,00:30:47.760,这是一个实际上发生在台湾,00:30:44.920,00:30:47.200,"This is a true story that happens in Taiwan,"
00:30:47.760,00:30:50.680,也是时发生在美国民主,00:30:47.440,00:30:50.320,and it also occurs in the United States.
00:30:50.720,00:30:52.680,台湾自炫的民主的陷阱,00:30:50.320,00:30:52.680,The democracy that Taiwan flaunts is a trap.
00:30:52.720,00:30:54.360,有个跟美国不一样,,,
00:30:54.360,00:30:56.280,是美国没有国族认同的问题,00:30:52.720,00:30:56.240,One significant difference from the US is that the US doesn't have a national identity problem.
00:30:56.280,00:30:57.880,可是台湾就变成有,00:30:56.280,00:30:57.920,But this is a problem in Taiwan.
00:30:57.920,00:30:59.280,因为这是当政的人,,,
00:30:59.320,00:31:00.560,就有意为之,00:30:57.920,00:31:00.720,The ruling party intentionally makes this an issue.
00:31:00.560,00:31:04.080,我就是要在台湾用披着,00:31:00.720,00:31:06.180,"They want to sneakily complete ""Taiwan independence"","
00:31:05.160,00:31:07.080,国民党带来的体质,,,
00:31:07.080,00:31:08.640,用着怪双膝,00:31:06.180,00:31:10.680,under the cover of the KMT heritage
00:31:08.680,00:31:11.080,故宫的六十万件的宝贝,,,
00:31:11.120,00:31:13.320,来完成我的台独,,,
00:31:13.320,00:31:16.880,就不知不觉的就完成我的台独,00:31:10.680,00:31:16.880,"and the 600,000 treasures in the Waishuangxi Palace Museum."
00:31:16.960,00:31:18.760,当年从国跟国民党,,,
00:31:18.760,00:31:20.160,从大陆过去的,00:31:16.960,00:31:22.580,The first generation who followed the KMT from the mainland to Taiwan
00:31:20.160,00:31:22.800,他第一代逃难到台湾的这些人,,,
00:31:22.800,00:31:24.880,他都一一个雕翎,00:31:22.580,00:31:24.880,is withering one after another.
00:31:24.880,00:31:26.280,你看已经七十年,00:31:24.880,00:31:26.420,"Seventy years have passed,"
00:31:26.320,00:31:27.840,所以他们现在很多已经几乎都,00:31:26.420,00:31:28.620,and many of them are no longer alive.
00:31:27.840,00:31:28.520,凋零,,,
00:31:28.520,00:31:32.000,所以为什么我觉得非常恐惧,00:31:28.620,00:31:32.000,This is the reason for my great fear.
00:31:32.040,00:31:33.160,在2004年,00:31:32.040,00:31:33.300,"In the end,"
00:31:33.160,00:31:35.480,我最后讲一下2004年,00:31:33.300,00:31:38.800,Let me talk about this book I published in 2004.
00:31:36.880,00:31:38.240,我出版这本书,,,
00:31:39.400,00:31:41.120,陈水扁靠两颗子弹,,,
00:31:41.400,00:31:41.880,然后,00:31:39.240,00:31:43.720,It was about how Chen Shui-bian used two bullets to manipulate and falsify.
00:31:41.960,00:31:43.720,操作弄讲,,,
00:31:44.000,00:31:44.920,我写站立的,,,
00:31:44.960,00:31:45.480,未来,,,
00:31:45.480,00:31:47.440,解购台湾新独裁,00:31:44.000,00:31:47.440,"""Trambling Future: Taiwan's New Dictatorship"""
00:31:47.440,00:31:49.720,那个时候我就把民进党跟,00:31:47.440,00:31:51.140,"At that time, I compared the DPP with the Nazis."
00:31:49.760,00:31:52.160,跟纳粹比较发现,,,
00:31:52.160,00:31:55.240,它是惊人相似的一个套路,00:31:51.140,00:31:55.240,I found they had a strikingly similar routine:
00:31:55.280,00:31:56.720,然后操纵,00:31:55.280,00:31:58.200,to manipulate hatred.
00:31:56.840,00:31:58.200,操纵那种仇恨,,,
00:31:58.240,00:31:58.960,为什么,00:31:58.240,00:31:59.540,How?
00:31:59.240,00:32:00.680,纳粹希特勒,,,
00:32:00.680,00:32:02.200,他是在威玛共和,00:31:59.540,00:32:03.860,Nazi Hitler turned Germany into dictatorship
00:32:02.200,00:32:04.840,当时德国最民主的状态下,,,
00:32:04.880,00:32:06.600,然后它变成什么,00:32:03.860,00:32:07.960,under its most democratic state of the Weimar Republic.
00:32:07.000,00:32:07.960,它变成独裁,,,
00:32:08.360,00:32:09.880,我利用一个民主的体制,00:32:08.360,00:32:10.900,"He utilized a seemingly democratic system,"
00:32:09.880,00:32:10.720,表面上技术铁路,,,
00:32:10.720,00:32:11.920,然后最后搞成,,,
00:32:11.920,00:32:13.920,最后变成纳粹变成法西斯,00:32:10.900,00:32:13.920,"and finally turned it into Nazi, into a fascist state."
00:32:14.120,00:32:15.640,这个之前就发生过了,,,
00:32:15.640,00:32:17.240,台湾依然可以如此,00:32:14.120,00:32:18.300,"Even though this has happened long ago,
it can still happen in Taiwan."
00:32:17.240,00:32:18.480,依然是这样子,,,
00:32:18.480,00:32:20.640,所以要操作是很容易的,00:32:18.480,00:32:20.640,It is very simple to manipulate.
00:32:20.840,00:32:22.480,两岸终将统一,00:32:20.840,00:32:22.600,"The two sides across the strait will eventually reunify,"
00:32:22.480,00:32:23.560,必定统一,,,
00:32:23.560,00:32:24.600,一定会统一,00:32:22.600,00:32:24.660,"we must reunify,
we will definitely reunify,"
00:32:24.600,00:32:25.600,而且我也觉得说,,,
00:32:25.600,00:32:27.360,我这一辈子一定会看到,00:32:24.660,00:32:27.360,and I believe I can see it in my life.
00:32:27.560,00:32:28.320,我觉得,00:32:27.560,00:32:28.720,"I think,"
00:32:28.600,00:32:30.400,中国人要有一个底气,00:32:28.720,00:32:31.880,the Chinese people must be confident and assertive.
00:32:30.400,00:32:31.880,要有一个自信,,,
00:32:31.880,00:32:34.480,就是我们中国人这样的领土,00:32:31.880,00:32:35.380,"China has its own territory, its own land,"
00:32:34.520,00:32:35.480,这样的国土,,,
00:32:35.520,00:32:36.720,这样的人民,00:32:35.520,00:32:36.720,and its own people -
00:32:36.720,00:32:38.560,我们要走自己的路,00:32:36.720,00:32:38.560,we must walk our own path.
00:32:38.560,00:32:39.400,你想想看,,,
00:32:39.400,00:32:41.760,如果大陆是用台湾的方式,00:32:38.560,00:32:41.960,"Just imagine, if the mainland uses Taiwan's method,"
00:32:42.880,00:32:45.120,谁要去帮助贫困的地方,00:32:42.680,00:32:45.120,then who will help the poor areas?
00:32:45.600,00:32:47.080,每个人上海人,00:32:45.600,00:32:48.440,"For example, Shanghainese will just need to think about their own interests."
00:32:47.080,00:32:48.640,只要管自己的利益就好,,,
00:32:48.720,00:32:50.200,上海人为什么要帮助别人,00:32:48.540,00:32:50.400,Why should they help others?
00:32:50.240,00:32:51.680,所有的贫富不均,00:32:50.400,00:32:52.980,And no one will help resolve the rich and poor divide.
00:32:51.720,00:32:52.880,没有人要帮助,,,
00:32:53.080,00:32:55.320,所以那样子的一种民主的体制,,,
00:32:55.320,00:32:56.560,所谓民主的体制,00:32:53.080,00:32:59.620,"Therefore, this so-called democratic system devastates human rights most."
00:32:56.600,00:32:59.880,其实是一个最掠夺人权的体制,,,
00:32:59.920,00:33:00.240,好,,,
00:33:00.240,00:33:00.960,谢谢,00:32:59.920,00:33:01.280,Thank you.
00:33:01.320,00:33:02.000,谢谢,00:33:01.320,00:33:02.840,Thank you.
00:33:06.400,00:33:06.600,好,,,
00:33:06.600,00:33:08.080,谢谢两位给出的演讲,00:33:06.600,00:33:08.260,Thank you both for the keynotes.
00:33:08.120,00:33:09.080,刚才张教授特别,,,
00:33:09.120,00:33:09.600,说,,,
00:33:09.720,00:33:11.800,台湾的这样的一个现状,00:33:08.260,00:33:13.200,Professor Zhang gave us a few insights about Taiwan.
00:33:11.800,00:33:13.200,就告诉我们几点启发,,,
00:33:13.200,00:33:13.960,其中有一点,,,
00:33:13.960,00:33:16.960,就真的要摆脱西方的那种范式,00:33:13.200,00:33:16.940,One of them is to break away from the Western paradigm.
00:33:17.000,00:33:18.400,要从里面突破出来,00:33:17.000,00:33:18.440,Step out of it.
00:33:18.400,00:33:19.840,刚才黄女士也特别说,,,
00:33:19.840,00:33:21.080,台湾目前的困境,00:33:18.440,00:33:21.500,Ms Huang also mentioned that Taiwan’s current problem is
00:33:21.080,00:33:21.800,它就是所谓的,,,
00:33:21.800,00:33:24.040,西方的模式的这种困境,00:33:21.500,00:33:24.160,the so-called Western model predicament.
00:33:24.160,00:33:25.960,这样的困境就放在眼前,00:33:24.160,00:33:27.660,Can Taiwanese break through such a predicament?
00:33:26.000,00:33:27.920,台湾人自己能不能突破,,,
00:33:27.960,00:33:29.120,我自己比较悲观,00:33:27.960,00:33:29.480,I am relatively pessimistic.
00:33:29.160,00:33:31.320,因为一旦进入西方这个模式,00:33:29.480,00:33:31.400,"Because once entering this Western model,"
00:33:31.480,00:33:33.600,我老说就要么希望到失望,00:33:31.480,00:33:35.060,"as I always said, it would either go from hope to disappointment or hope to despair."
00:33:33.640,00:33:34.880,要么希望到绝望,,,
00:33:34.880,00:33:36.360,很难再跳出来的,00:33:35.060,00:33:36.800,It is hard to jump out.
00:33:36.800,00:33:38.920,但台湾是可能为数不多的,00:33:36.800,00:33:40.260,"Taiwan may be one of the few places where there is still an opportunity,"
00:33:38.920,00:33:40.160,还有机遇的地方,,,
00:33:40.200,00:33:41.840,那就是和平统一之后,00:33:40.260,00:33:42.420,and the opportunity is peaceful reunification.
00:33:42.600,00:33:43.280,同意之后,,,
00:33:43.880,00:33:44.960,一是一国两制,00:33:42.740,00:33:44.980,"After reunification, even if it is ""one country, two systems"","
00:33:45.000,00:33:46.520,我想是与时俱进的,00:33:45.000,00:33:47.740,the policy will also advance with the times.
00:33:46.520,00:33:47.280,一国两制,,,
00:33:48.120,00:33:49.320,台湾的民主制度,,,
00:33:49.320,00:33:51.800,也要就我前面提过建议的,00:33:48.120,00:33:51.700,"As I suggested, Taiwan's democratic system"
00:33:51.840,00:33:54.360,更能够面向民生的,00:33:51.840,00:33:54.300,should focus more on people's livelihood
00:33:54.480,00:33:55.640,民生导向的,00:33:54.300,00:33:55.860,and be livelihood-oriented.
00:33:55.640,00:33:56.320,更包含,,,
00:33:56.320,00:34:00.040,中国传统文化因素的寻求共识,00:33:55.860,00:33:59.280,"It should also embrace more of China's traditional ""consensus-seeking thinking"""
00:34:00.040,00:34:02.120,而不寻求对抗的民主,00:33:59.280,00:34:02.120,instead of confrontation in democracy.
00:34:02.240,00:34:04.080,大陆可以提供很多的经验,00:34:02.240,00:34:04.400,The mainland can provide a lot of experience.
00:34:04.440,00:34:06.160,我觉得台湾要汲取很多的教训,00:34:04.400,00:34:06.160,I think Taiwan has a lot to learn.
00:34:06.160,00:34:07.320,这制度一定要改,00:34:06.160,00:34:07.500,This system must be changed.
00:34:07.320,00:34:10.320,我唯一比黄老师稍微乐观点,00:34:07.500,00:34:10.540,I am only slightly more optimistic than Ms. Huang on one thing:
00:34:10.600,00:34:12.040,我还是相信最终,,,
00:34:12.360,00:34:15.480,形势比人强I我可以理解,00:34:10.600,00:34:14.060,"I still believe that ""the trend is stronger than individuals""."
00:34:15.760,00:34:17.760,现在特别是台湾年轻人,00:34:14.400,00:34:17.880,"I can understand that under the current  ""Taiwan independence"" climate,"
00:34:17.800,00:34:20.040,在台独环境当中,00:34:17.880,00:34:22.360,young people in Taiwan have been experiencing increasing depression.
00:34:20.280,00:34:21.400,气氛越来越压抑,,,
00:34:21.400,00:34:22.200,坦率的说,,,
00:34:22.920,00:34:25.560,但我觉得物极必反,00:34:22.960,00:34:27.320,"Still, I believe that ""there is a reverse after the peak."""
00:34:25.600,00:34:27.160,到一个点上之后,,,
00:34:27.880,00:34:29.920,特别大陆方方面面的,00:34:27.880,00:34:31.800,The mainland also needs to progressively put measures in place.
00:34:29.920,00:34:31.800,有关的措施也要到位,,,
00:34:31.840,00:34:34.000,我相信有办法的,00:34:31.840,00:34:34.140,I believe we will find a solution.
00:34:34.920,00:34:37.120,这个就是我们在台湾存在,,,
00:34:37.160,00:34:37.600,在台湾,00:34:34.920,00:34:39.720,"This is the reason why we feel as if we were
""working as spies in our enemies"""
00:34:37.640,00:34:38.440,其实每一天,,,
00:34:38.440,00:34:40.360,都觉得在做敌后工作,,,
00:34:40.400,00:34:43.160,可是我们觉得必须要做的原因,00:34:40.400,00:34:43.160,but we think we must do it.
00:34:43.200,00:34:45.400,曾经有很多观众跟我讲说,00:34:43.520,00:34:45.720,Many audiences told me that
00:34:46.560,00:34:48.040,他已经有20年,00:34:45.920,00:34:48.340,it's been 20 years that they fear to speak out
00:34:48.480,00:34:49.840,不敢在公开场合说,00:34:48.480,00:34:50.960,that they identify as Chinese in public.
00:34:49.840,00:34:50.960,他是中国人了,,,
00:34:51.480,00:34:53.280,你可以想象那种荒谬吗,00:34:51.480,00:34:53.500,Can you imagine how absurd that is?
00:34:53.560,00:34:55.480,我们的体制就是一个中国的,00:34:53.560,00:34:55.480,Our system is one China -
00:34:55.480,00:34:56.080,台湾,,,
00:34:56.120,00:34:57.080,就是中国的领土,00:34:55.480,00:34:57.080,Taiwan is China's territory.
00:34:57.080,00:34:59.040,在台湾自己的法律体制,00:34:57.080,00:34:59.320,It is enforced in Taiwan's legal system.
00:34:59.040,00:34:59.640,就是,,,
00:34:59.720,00:35:01.560,但他不敢公开讲,00:34:59.320,00:35:02.320,"However, they just dare not publicly say that they are Chinese."
00:35:01.600,00:35:02.400,他是中国人,,,
00:35:02.440,00:35:04.120,台湾我很害怕改革,00:35:02.440,00:35:04.120,We are scared of reforms in Taiwan.
00:35:04.160,00:35:05.560,每次都举出来一个理由,,,
00:35:05.560,00:35:06.880,说老百姓说很讨厌,00:35:04.160,00:35:07.440,"Every time they come up with a reason, saying ""the people hate this"""
00:35:07.440,00:35:08.440,然后我为了老百姓,,,
00:35:08.440,00:35:09.720,讨厌我门来改革,00:35:07.440,00:35:09.720,"and ""I'm doing this for the people""."
00:35:09.720,00:35:11.040,然后我们就私底下讲,00:35:09.720,00:35:12.240,Then they did a lot of tricks under the counter
00:35:11.080,00:35:12.240,搞那么浓厚,,,
00:35:12.320,00:35:13.920,变成图利我更多,00:35:12.320,00:35:13.920,so that it will benefit themselves more.
00:35:13.960,00:35:15.320,然后老百姓更痛苦,00:35:13.960,00:35:15.520,But people will suffer even more.
00:35:15.320,00:35:17.680,但老百姓已经投完票了,00:35:15.520,00:35:17.680,"But The people have already voted,"
00:35:17.720,00:35:18.720,他只好继续在等,,,
00:35:18.720,00:35:20.640,下面四年再来改变,00:35:17.720,00:35:20.900,so they have to wait for the next four years before they can change anything.
00:35:20.640,00:35:22.520,然后下面四年我在操作,00:35:20.900,00:35:22.520,Then they would do the same manipulation four years later -
00:35:22.560,00:35:23.680,我再找俊男美女,,,
00:35:23.680,00:35:24.600,然后在这边唱歌,00:35:22.560,00:35:24.980,"getting more good-looking men and women to dance on the stage,"
00:35:24.640,00:35:25.080,跳舞,,,
00:35:25.080,00:35:26.000,我又当选,00:35:25.080,00:35:26.620,and then re-election is secured.
00:35:26.680,00:35:28.280,所以永远无解悟,00:35:26.680,00:35:29.840,This dilemma of democracy will not find a solution.
00:35:28.280,00:35:30.120,所以民主的困境,,,
00:35:30.120,00:35:31.960,台湾是民主自己的困境,00:35:29.840,00:35:32.340,Taiwan has this democracy dilemma and
00:35:32.000,00:35:33.760,跟台湾自己本身的,,,
00:35:33.800,00:35:35.960,独特架构下的困境,00:35:32.340,00:35:35.960,the predicament in its [social] structure.
00:35:36.160,00:35:38.360,我的感觉是越快统一,00:35:36.160,00:35:38.360,"I feel that the faster the reunification,"
00:35:38.360,00:35:40.440,才能够越快的解决这个问题,00:35:38.360,00:35:40.620,the faster this problem can be solved.
00:35:40.480,00:35:41.800,就是靠台湾自己,,,
00:35:41.800,00:35:43.000,很难解决这个问题,00:35:40.620,00:35:43.020,It is challenging for Taiwan to solve the problem by itself.
00:35:43.000,00:35:44.600,人是没有办法拉着自己的头发,,,
00:35:44.640,00:35:46.440,把自己拔离地面的,00:35:43.020,00:35:46.440,A person cannot pull themselves off the ground by pulling their hair.
00:35:46.480,00:35:47.440,就像您刚才说,,,
00:35:47.440,00:35:48.640,台湾的政治生态,00:35:46.480,00:35:49.360,"If you follow Taiwan's news,"
00:35:48.640,00:35:49.680,可能大家去关注,,,
00:35:49.720,00:35:51.720,台湾地区新闻的人都会发现,00:35:49.380,00:35:53.260,you will find that the PMs have physical conflicts a lot.
00:35:51.720,00:35:52.640,他们的所谓的议员,,,
00:35:52.760,00:35:53.600,经常会打架,,,
00:35:53.600,00:35:54.640,您刚刚也说了,00:35:53.420,00:35:54.640,"As you mentioned,"
00:35:54.680,00:35:56.160,经常会上演全武行,00:35:54.680,00:35:57.780,"they often put on a show of ""gang fights"" with total disregard of any manners."
00:35:56.520,00:35:57.760,然后斯文扫地,,,
00:35:57.800,00:35:58.560,让大家看的,,,
00:35:58.560,00:35:59.640,瞠目结舌,00:35:57.780,00:35:59.640,It makes everyone astonished.
00:35:59.680,00:36:01.400,这个也是台湾整个政治生态的,00:35:59.680,00:36:02.440,It is a manifestation of Taiwan's political ecology.
00:36:01.400,00:36:02.640,一种外化的表现,,,
00:36:02.640,00:36:04.360,前几天我还看到一条新闻,00:36:02.640,00:36:04.620,"A few days ago, I also saw news saying that"
00:36:04.400,00:36:05.560,说他们的所谓的议员,,,
00:36:05.600,00:36:07.280,在打架的时候,00:36:04.620,00:36:09.900,"the PMs used ""screaming rubber chickens"" when they fought."
00:36:07.280,00:36:08.360,就打嘴仗的时候,,,
00:36:08.360,00:36:10.280,还按那种惨叫鸡,,,
00:36:10.440,00:36:11.480,可能是一种会,,,
00:36:11.480,00:36:11.800,一按,,,
00:36:11.800,00:36:13.320,就发出这种惨叫的声音,00:36:10.440,00:36:13.320,It is a toy that makes a screaming sound when you press it.
00:36:13.360,00:36:14.560,结果整个会场里面,,,
00:36:14.560,00:36:15.880,就惨叫声不断,00:36:13.360,00:36:15.880,"As a result, the hall was filled with noisy screams."
00:36:16.160,00:36:17.400,真的斯文扫地,00:36:15.900,00:36:17.500,It was truly disgraceful.
00:36:17.400,00:36:19.440,可是就是这样一种政治生态,,,
00:36:19.480,00:36:20.640,就是这样的一些人,00:36:17.500,00:36:23.040,"However, it is such people who are, in their own words, ""serving the people""."
00:36:20.640,00:36:23.320,在为老百姓所谓的在为做事,,,
00:36:23.320,00:36:25.200,但其实老百姓并没有,,,
00:36:25.320,00:36:26.280,真正的感受到,00:36:23.320,00:36:27.440,But the people do not see any social development happening.
00:36:26.280,00:36:27.440,社会发展的利益,,,
00:36:27.440,00:36:28.840,所以接下来我们要开放,00:36:27.440,00:36:29.260,"So next, let's open up the discussion."
00:36:28.840,00:36:29.200,讨论,,,
00:36:29.200,00:36:30.520,大家对于台湾问题,00:36:29.260,00:36:31.720,What are your opinions on the Taiwan issue?
00:36:30.520,00:36:31.720,有些什么样的观点,,,
00:36:31.720,00:36:32.960,你们的思考在哪,00:36:31.720,00:36:32.960,What are your thoughts?
00:36:33.160,00:36:36.200,我是来自上海大学的一名研究生,00:36:33.160,00:36:36.200,I am a graduate student at Shanghai University.
00:36:36.280,00:36:38.640,我以前有很多台湾的同学,00:36:36.280,00:36:38.640,I got many classmates from Taiwan.
00:36:38.800,00:36:39.720,然后他们说,,,
00:36:39.720,00:36:41.160,如果以后打仗的话,00:36:38.800,00:36:41.160,"They said that if there was a war in the future,"
00:36:41.160,00:36:43.600,他们还是会去台湾那边当兵,00:36:41.160,00:36:43.600,they would still serve as soldiers in Taiwan.
00:36:43.600,00:36:45.800,然后可能子弹还会设想,00:36:43.600,00:36:46.220,And their bullets would shot toward us.
00:36:45.800,00:36:46.640,我们看,,,
00:36:46.880,00:36:48.160,你们都已经讨论到,00:36:46.320,00:36:48.800,"Wow, you have already discussed such details!"
00:36:48.200,00:36:48.800,这个程度,,,
00:36:48.880,00:36:49.840,以前初中的时候,,,
00:36:49.880,00:36:51.840,然后同学现在已经回去服役了,00:36:48.880,00:36:51.800,"It was in junior high school,
and he is serving in the military now."
00:36:52.200,00:36:53.480,他不是自愿的,00:36:52.000,00:36:53.480,Not voluntarily.
00:36:53.480,00:36:54.280,他如果不回去,,,
00:36:54.280,00:36:55.160,他变逃兵,00:36:53.480,00:36:56.520,"If he does not go back,
he will become a deserter and sent to jail."
00:36:55.560,00:36:55.840,然后,,,
00:36:55.880,00:36:56.560,他要坐牢,,,
00:36:56.560,00:36:58.080,这也是台湾的当地,00:36:56.560,00:36:59.160,This is a local regulation in Taiwan.
00:36:58.120,00:36:59.160,特别的一种规定,,,
00:36:59.480,00:37:01.120,然后今天我的问题,00:36:59.480,00:37:01.560,My question today is that
00:37:01.960,00:37:03.280,最近香港问题,,,
00:37:03.600,00:37:05.000,一直在刺痛着我们的神经,00:37:01.960,00:37:05.000,the Hong Kong issue has been on our nerves recently.
00:37:05.000,00:37:05.520,然后我的问题,,,
00:37:06.200,00:37:09.520,与台湾的台独势力相比,00:37:05.000,00:37:08.740,"Compared with ""Taiwan separatists"","
00:37:09.520,00:37:11.480,港独势力最近的所作所为,,,
00:37:11.480,00:37:12.400,是否在国际上,00:37:08.740,00:37:14.400,"have the recent actions of the ""Hong Kong separatists"" caused a more negative impact internationally?"
00:37:12.400,00:37:13.320,造成了,,,
00:37:13.360,00:37:14.760,更加负面的影响,,,
00:37:14.760,00:37:15.960,然后这两种势力,,,
00:37:16.000,00:37:16.720,它们之间,00:37:14.760,00:37:18.160,What are the similarities and differences between these two forces?
00:37:16.720,00:37:18.160,有什么相同点和不同点,,,
00:37:18.800,00:37:20.040,共同点很简单,00:37:18.800,00:37:20.320,Their similarity is simple:
00:37:20.040,00:37:21.640,都将走向灭亡,00:37:20.320,00:37:23.120,they will perish.
00:37:22.040,00:37:23.200,这毫无疑问的,,,
00:37:23.720,00:37:24.760,不同是有一点不同,00:37:23.560,00:37:24.760,"For differences,"
00:37:24.760,00:37:27.160,因为港图是个比较新的东西,00:37:24.760,00:37:27.160,"""Hong Kong separatism"" is a relatively new thing."
00:37:27.160,00:37:28.440,如果我没有记错,00:37:27.160,00:37:28.600,"If I remember correctly,"
00:37:28.440,00:37:30.240,就是几年前开始,,,
00:37:30.320,00:37:32.160,香港学联搞了一个杂志,00:37:28.600,00:37:32.160,the Hong Kong Federation of Students started a magazine a few years ago.
00:37:32.160,00:37:33.480,里边要登文章,,,
00:37:33.480,00:37:35.800,要探讨香港独立的可能性,00:37:32.300,00:37:35.940,"Their articles started to explore the possibility of ""Hong Kong independence""."
00:37:36.440,00:37:38.480,所以它根基更加薄弱,00:37:36.440,00:37:38.620,Their theories have an even weaker foundation.
00:37:38.760,00:37:40.600,台独恐怕可以追溯到,00:37:38.760,00:37:40.600,"As for ""Taiwan independence"","
00:37:41.680,00:37:42.560,四五年,,,
00:37:42.560,00:37:43.920,日本投降以后,00:37:41.680,00:37:43.920,it can be traced back to Japan's surrender in 1945.
00:37:43.920,00:37:46.440,他就留了一部分人就搞台独,00:37:43.920,00:37:46.960,"Some Japanese were left on the island to promote ""Taiwan independence."""
00:37:47.280,00:37:48.280,在两蒋时期,00:37:47.280,00:37:48.280,"In the ""Two Chiangs"" period,"
00:37:48.280,00:37:49.920,他对共产党是镇压的,00:37:48.280,00:37:51.360,Communist Party and Taiwan separatism were both suppressed.
00:37:49.920,00:37:51.360,对台独也是镇压的,,,
00:37:51.360,00:37:52.560,所以我记得我在这讲过,,,
00:37:52.560,00:37:53.880,当时李敖讲的故事,00:37:51.360,00:37:53.880,I remember that I told you about Li Ao's story before.
00:37:53.920,00:37:55.560,他出过国民党的牢,00:37:53.920,00:37:55.620,He was in the KMT's prison.
00:37:55.600,00:37:57.040,他说台独全是孬种,00:37:55.620,00:37:58.080,He said the Taiwan separatists were a bunch of cowards.
00:37:57.160,00:37:57.600,对不对,,,
00:37:57.600,00:37:59.480,他觉得被抓的最后,,,
00:37:59.840,00:38:02.160,绝大部分全是清供,00:37:58.080,00:38:03.140,Mostly prisoners were pro-Communist or Communists party members.
00:38:02.200,00:38:03.200,或者共产党人,,,
00:38:03.320,00:38:05.040,到最后就一个是台独,,,
00:38:05.040,00:38:06.720,后来发现台独还是个神经病,00:38:03.320,00:38:07.560,"There was only one ""Taiwan independence"" guy who they found out later was mentally ill."
00:38:07.680,00:38:09.320,所以他觉得他没有真正胆量,00:38:07.680,00:38:09.320,Hence Li Ao felt that they had no guts.
00:38:09.520,00:38:10.720,当时李敖讲的话,00:38:09.520,00:38:10.720,That's what Li Ao said.
00:38:10.760,00:38:11.960,但背后也是反映了,,,
00:38:12.360,00:38:13.280,当时,00:38:10.760,00:38:14.540,It somehow reflects how Taiwan separatism was controlled
00:38:13.680,00:38:14.600,两蒋的时期,,,
00:38:14.600,00:38:16.160,他对这个是控制的,00:38:14.600,00:38:16.160,"in the ""Two Chiangs"" period."
00:38:16.160,00:38:18.240,但后来搞民主化之后,00:38:16.380,00:38:18.680,"With the beginning of democratization,"
00:38:18.680,00:38:20.360,台独特别帮民进党,,,
00:38:20.400,00:38:22.320,全部变成正式的政党,00:38:18.680,00:38:22.320,"""Taiwan separatists"" helped the DPP become a formal party,"
00:38:22.360,00:38:25.480,然后开始甚至走上了政治舞台,00:38:22.360,00:38:25.480,and they even stepped onto the political arena.
00:38:25.480,00:38:27.040,是在这么一个过程,00:38:25.480,00:38:27.200,This is the process.
00:38:27.040,00:38:29.120,但好在对台独,,,
00:38:29.120,00:38:30.480,我们非常明确的,00:38:27.200,00:38:31.720,"Fortunately, we have a very clear ""Anti-Secession Law""  for these separatists，"
00:38:31.120,00:38:32.200,反国家分裂法,,,
00:38:32.240,00:38:33.920,2005年通过的,00:38:32.240,00:38:34.000,which was passed in 2005.
00:38:34.080,00:38:36.320,其中提出几个条件,00:38:34.080,00:38:36.320,It states several conditions
00:38:36.760,00:38:37.400,在这种情况下,,,
00:38:37.440,00:38:39.240,我们将采用非和平的手段,00:38:36.760,00:38:39.820,under which we can resort to non-peaceful measures.
00:38:40.240,00:38:42.440,对港独我觉得,00:38:40.240,00:38:43.260,"Regarding ""Hong Kong separatism"", if you have read"
00:38:42.560,00:38:43.840,大家你有没有仔细看,,,
00:38:43.840,00:38:46.680,这次十九届四中全会公报里边有,00:38:43.280,00:38:47.680,about the communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee.
00:38:46.680,00:38:47.120,一句话,,,
00:38:47.760,00:38:52.160,叫做是建设健全,00:38:47.760,00:38:56.900,"It says: ""Establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanism of Hong Kong SAR"
00:38:53.360,00:38:55.120,特别行政区,,,
00:38:55.160,00:38:57.120,维护国家安全的,,,
00:38:57.120,00:38:58.080,法律制度,,,
00:38:58.080,00:38:59.560,和执行机制,00:38:57.120,00:38:59.560,"to safeguard national security."""
00:38:59.800,00:39:01.440,这个话是掷地有声的,,,
00:39:02.280,00:39:05.000,我们这个觉得讲得非常好,00:38:59.800,00:39:04.800,This voices our position out loud.
00:39:05.200,00:39:07.040,下面我们看怎么来落实,00:39:04.800,00:39:07.040,Let's wait and see how it implements.
00:39:07.120,00:39:09.240,所以最终是我还是这句老话,00:39:07.120,00:39:09.680,"In the end, I hold the same opinion:"
00:39:09.880,00:39:12.560,不管他们一时会多么的猖狂,00:39:09.880,00:39:15.080,"no matter how rampant they are at the moment, the trend does not stand with them."
00:39:12.840,00:39:15.720,但是这个大事不在他们一边,,,
00:39:16.160,00:39:18.480,那么中国崛起的势头不可主导,00:39:16.160,00:39:18.740,The rise of China is unstoppable.
00:39:18.520,00:39:20.920,而且我相信在我们新时代,00:39:18.740,00:39:22.540,"Also, I believe that in our new era,
we can solve all these problems."
00:39:20.920,00:39:22.400,这些问题都要把它解决,,,
00:39:22.720,00:39:24.720,它们的共同点就是说,00:39:22.720,00:39:24.720,"In my opinion, what they have in common is:"
00:39:24.720,00:39:25.920,第一项老师讲,00:39:24.720,00:39:26.960,"first, as Prof. Zhang said,
they will definitely perish."
00:39:25.960,00:39:27.080,是绝对会灭亡,,,
00:39:27.080,00:39:28.160,不可能成功的,,,
00:39:28.360,00:39:30.280,两岸终将统一,00:39:27.060,00:39:30.180,"They won't succeed,
and China will eventually be unified."
00:39:30.320,00:39:32.440,第二个是其实都存在着,,,
00:39:32.480,00:39:33.520,香港跟台湾,00:39:30.320,00:39:35.920,"Secondly is that Hong Kong and Taiwan were once colonies,"
00:39:33.560,00:39:35.920,都曾经作为殖民地,,,
00:39:35.960,00:39:38.320,所以留下了一个很大的空间,,,
00:39:38.360,00:39:39.960,让外国的势力,00:39:35.960,00:39:41.080,"so there is plenty of room
for foreign forces to intervene."
00:39:40.000,00:39:41.800,可以介入来操作,,,
00:39:41.840,00:39:44.960,台湾过去有日本留下来的很多,00:39:41.840,00:39:45.760,Taiwan has a lot of influence left by Japan.
00:39:44.960,00:39:45.760,影响力,,,
00:39:45.760,00:39:47.560,而现在因为台湾在经济,,,
00:39:47.560,00:39:48.560,在贸易上面,,,
00:39:48.560,00:39:49.440,跟日本,00:39:45.760,00:39:51.640,Now Taiwan is very close to Japan in economics and trade.
00:39:49.480,00:39:50.280,是,,,
00:39:50.400,00:39:51.640,非常紧密的,,,
00:39:51.640,00:39:55.680,甚至日本常常会跟台湾的公司,00:39:51.640,00:39:57.780,Japan often unites with Taiwanese companies to enter the mainland market.
00:39:55.680,00:39:56.440,联合,,,
00:39:56.440,00:39:58.040,然后来打大陆的市场,,,
00:39:58.080,00:39:59.240,因为他们知道,,,
00:39:59.240,00:39:59.880,日本公司,,,
00:39:59.880,00:40:00.680,直接打到市场,00:39:58.080,00:40:01.840,They know that Japanese companies cannot win the mainland market directly.
00:40:00.680,00:40:01.520,打不起来,,,
00:40:01.520,00:40:01.880,好,,,
00:40:02.120,00:40:03.360,这样就有利益,00:40:01.840,00:40:03.800,So they share common interests.
00:40:03.360,00:40:04.240,所以为什么,,,
00:40:04.240,00:40:06.560,以前我的节目在台湾,00:40:03.800,00:40:09.320,"Therefore, when I used to talk about Japan's colonial exploitation on my shows,"
00:40:07.040,00:40:08.320,我最常讲,,,
00:40:08.600,00:40:09.640,日据时代,,,
00:40:09.640,00:40:11.280,怎么样剥削台湾人,,,
00:40:11.400,00:40:12.320,日本商社,00:40:09.320,00:40:14.320,Japanese trading associations and Japanese companies would call and protest.
00:40:12.320,00:40:12.960,日本公司,,,
00:40:12.960,00:40:14.320,就会打电话来抗议,,,
00:40:14.560,00:40:17.000,所以影响力是这样子的,00:40:14.560,00:40:17.000,This manifests their influence.
00:40:17.000,00:40:18.600,太阳花发生的时候,,,
00:40:18.600,00:40:20.520,第2天早上9:00,00:40:17.000,00:40:20.520,"When the Sunflower Student Movement happened,
the Japanese trading associations sent supplies"
00:40:20.600,00:40:21.680,日本商社,,,
00:40:22.480,00:40:24.840,它的物资就送到立法院,00:40:20.600,00:40:24.700,"to the ""Legislative Yuan"" the next morning."
00:40:24.920,00:40:25.280,里,,,
00:40:25.720,00:40:26.360,是非常快的,00:40:24.820,00:40:26.360,It was so fast.
00:40:26.360,00:40:28.480,所以你有主要有美国的势力,00:40:26.360,00:40:30.560,So America and Japan are the main forces
00:40:28.480,00:40:29.400,有日本的,,,
00:40:29.400,00:40:30.560,是有种种的事例,,,
00:40:30.600,00:40:32.760,那样子在台湾运作,00:40:30.600,00:40:32.760,that were operating in Taiwan.
00:40:32.760,00:40:35.280,香港一副如此港独,00:40:32.760,00:40:35.080,Same with Hong Kong.
00:40:36.000,00:40:38.120,他是在台湾学习的,00:40:35.080,00:40:38.800,Hong Kong separatists learnt from Taiwan
00:40:38.120,00:40:39.640,2014年的,,,
00:40:39.680,00:40:42.600,的雨伞运动,00:40:38.800,00:40:42.600,"and started the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement""."
00:40:42.640,00:40:43.960,其实领誓者,,,
00:40:43.960,00:40:45.720,跟这一次其实是类似的,00:40:42.640,00:40:45.720,The leaders are the same as this year's [protests].
00:40:45.840,00:40:48.160,而当时他们就曾经在三一九之后,00:40:45.840,00:40:49.460,"They went to Taiwan for training after the ""3-19 shooting incident ""."
00:40:48.160,00:40:49.360,到台湾去受训,,,
00:40:49.720,00:40:50.760,所以可以说,,,
00:40:50.760,00:40:52.840,港独跟台独是河流的,00:40:49.460,00:40:53.140,So we can say that Hong Kong separatists and Taiwan separatists are from the same stream.
00:40:53.080,00:40:53.720,好,,,
00:40:53.720,00:40:55.520,我们继续来听,00:40:53.940,00:40:57.000,"Okay, let’s welcome the next question."
00:40:55.520,00:40:55.840,现场,,,
00:40:55.840,00:40:57.000,还有哪位朋友的问题,,,
00:40:57.000,00:40:57.560,来欢迎,,,
00:40:57.560,00:40:59.200,也同样做个自我介绍,00:40:57.560,00:40:59.200,Please also briefly introduce yourself.
00:40:59.240,00:40:59.760,老师们好,,,
00:40:59.760,00:41:00.280,主持人好,,,
00:41:00.280,00:41:03.280,我是来自湖南的一名警校生,00:40:59.560,00:41:03.280,"Hi everyone, I am a police student from Hunan."
00:41:03.280,00:41:05.040,我认为作为中华儿女,,,
00:41:05.040,00:41:05.960,关心台湾问题,00:41:03.280,00:41:07.520,I think that every Chinese national should care about the Taiwan issue.
00:41:05.960,00:41:07.600,是我们每个人的义务,,,
00:41:07.800,00:41:09.320,我想知道,00:41:07.800,00:41:09.760,"What I would like to know is,"
00:41:09.440,00:41:12.400,来大陆得很多台湾年轻人,00:41:09.760,00:41:12.400,"many young Taiwanese have come to the mainland,"
00:41:12.440,00:41:13.320,看到了,,,
00:41:13.320,00:41:15.880,大陆快速便捷的,00:41:12.440,00:41:15.880,"have seen the mainland's convenient transportation,"
00:41:15.880,00:41:17.960,交通快捷的移动支付,00:41:15.880,00:41:17.960,"mobile payment,"
00:41:17.960,00:41:20.680,以及大陆庞大市场,,,
00:41:20.680,00:41:21.600,所带来的,00:41:17.960,00:41:24.220,and the  job opportunities in the mainland's huge market.
00:41:21.600,00:41:23.520,广阔营销环境,,,
00:41:23.520,00:41:24.840,工作机会等等,,,
00:41:25.000,00:41:26.000,回到台湾以后,,,
00:41:26.000,00:41:27.960,能给台湾社会带来多大的影响,00:41:25.000,00:41:27.960,What kind of influence will they bring back to Taiwan?
00:41:28.360,00:41:29.120,谢谢,00:41:28.180,00:41:29.120,Thank you.
00:41:29.160,00:41:29.320,好,,,
00:41:29.320,00:41:29.720,请坐,,,
00:41:29.720,00:41:30.640,也是一个好问题,00:41:29.180,00:41:30.660,Please sit down. Another good question.
00:41:30.640,00:41:31.800,而且我特别注意到,,,
00:41:31.800,00:41:33.760,我们这位朋友把关心台湾,00:41:30.660,00:41:35.640,And I  noticed that he views the Taiwan issue as a duty for all Chinese people.
00:41:33.800,00:41:34.320,问题上升,,,
00:41:34.360,00:41:36.400,到了每个中国人的义务这一点,,,
00:41:36.400,00:41:37.120,谢谢,00:41:35.960,00:41:37.480,Thanks for your question.
00:41:37.800,00:41:39.720,我自己也有不少台湾朋友,00:41:37.800,00:41:41.560,"I also have many Taiwanese friends
living on the island or in Shanghai."
00:41:39.760,00:41:41.680,在岛内的在上海,,,
00:41:41.680,00:41:42.800,应该说,,,
00:41:42.840,00:41:44.520,他们到大陆来之后,00:41:41.680,00:41:44.520,They were shocked
00:41:44.520,00:41:47.880,几乎都会受到很大的震撼,00:41:44.520,00:41:47.280,when they first came to the mainland.
00:41:47.880,00:41:49.640,这是很高的一个比例,00:41:47.280,00:41:49.960,A high proportion of Taiwanese feel the same.
00:41:50.000,00:41:50.760,但是我觉得,,,
00:41:51.200,00:41:52.960,我们也不能过高的估计,00:41:50.000,00:41:54.240,But there is an important reason why we can't overestimate [the influence].
00:41:52.960,00:41:54.240,一个重要原因是,,,
00:41:54.400,00:41:56.200,刚才黄老师也提到的,,,
00:41:56.240,00:41:58.680,台湾岛内的生态非常封闭的,00:41:54.400,00:41:58.220,"As Ms Huang mentioned, the closed [political] eco-system in Taiwan."
00:41:58.680,00:42:00.680,我老蒋自称有媒体,00:41:58.480,00:42:02.440,It claims to have media freedom and to be a democratic society.
00:42:00.680,00:42:02.440,自由自称为民主社会,,,
00:42:02.440,00:42:03.760,结果是最不民主,,,
00:42:03.760,00:42:05.720,最没有真正的自由,00:42:02.440,00:42:05.720,The reality is the right opposite:  undemocratic and lacking freedom.
00:42:05.760,00:42:07.040,你看香港也是的,,,
00:42:07.080,00:42:08.440,离深圳就这么近,00:42:05.760,00:42:08.360,"It is the same for Hong Kong.
HK is so close to Shenzhen,"
00:42:08.440,00:42:09.320,多数都不知道,,,
00:42:09.320,00:42:10.480,深圳齐集,00:42:08.440,00:42:10.780,but most people don't know the [economic] miracle of Shenzhen.
00:42:10.480,00:42:11.640,美国都害怕,,,
00:42:11.640,00:42:12.320,他们都不知道,00:42:10.820,00:42:13.140,"Even the US is afraid, but HK is unaware."
00:42:12.360,00:42:12.960,你知道吗,,,
00:42:13.160,00:42:14.920,所以他媒体,00:42:13.160,00:42:16.480,The local media is controlled by capital
00:42:14.920,00:42:16.480,它是资本力量控制,,,
00:42:16.480,00:42:18.960,他不希望你了解真实的情况,00:42:16.480,00:42:19.660,which does not want you to know the real situation.
00:42:19.440,00:42:22.680,所以这些人恐怕在会有影响,00:42:19.660,00:42:24.880,So those returning young Taiwanese will have some impacts but to a limited extent.
00:42:22.720,00:42:24.960,但是恐怕还在一定的范围之内,,,
00:42:25.400,00:42:26.240,那么另外一方面,,,
00:42:26.360,00:42:27.840,刚才这个同学提到的,00:42:25.400,00:42:29.560,"On the other hand, when we discuss in the mainland"
00:42:27.840,00:42:29.760,就是我们大陆自己,,,
00:42:30.120,00:42:31.720,在对台工作也好,00:42:29.840,00:42:31.720,"our work related to Taiwan,"
00:42:31.720,00:42:33.560,我们就讨论政治问题,,,
00:42:33.560,00:42:34.240,制度问题,00:42:31.720,00:42:36.180,"when we discuss political issues, systems, democracy, freedom of speech, etc."
00:42:34.240,00:42:34.880,民主问题,,,
00:42:34.880,00:42:36.320,言论自由问题,,,
00:42:36.440,00:42:38.160,他们觉得有的老师讲的没有,00:42:36.440,00:42:38.980,people may feel that their teachers are not convincing.
00:42:38.160,00:42:38.760,说服力,,,
00:42:39.360,00:42:40.640,这个是个普遍的问题,00:42:39.360,00:42:40.640,This is a common problem:
00:42:40.800,00:42:42.320,我们很多人他自己不自信,00:42:40.800,00:42:42.780,many of us are not confident.
00:42:42.360,00:42:42.920,你知道吗,,,
00:42:42.920,00:42:44.080,甚至刚才我讲的,00:42:42.920,00:42:44.140,"LIke I mentioned,"
00:42:44.120,00:42:45.080,我们工资,,,
00:42:45.280,00:42:46.280,在我们的教育界,00:42:44.140,00:42:47.860,some public intellectuals still  believe that Taiwan's system is the future
00:42:46.320,00:42:47.320,影响不小的,,,
00:42:47.960,00:42:49.160,还是认为台湾制度,,,
00:42:49.160,00:42:49.960,代表未来,00:42:47.860,00:42:51.680,and this will have considerable impacts on academia.
00:42:49.960,00:42:51.280,非常愚蠢的爱,,,
00:42:51.320,00:42:53.360,所以我们自己要,,,
00:42:53.680,00:42:55.440,真的发自内心的自信,00:42:51.680,00:42:55.440,"Therefore, we must have confidence from our hearts"
00:42:55.440,00:42:58.320,这样才能做好对香港的工作,00:42:55.440,00:42:58.620,so that we can do well when it comes to Taiwan and Hong Kong affairs.
00:42:58.320,00:43:00.120,但我觉得影响是,,,
00:43:00.120,00:43:02.160,慢慢会逐步扩大的,00:42:58.620,00:43:02.160,But also I believe such influence will gradually expand.
00:43:02.160,00:43:03.320,我相信这一点,,,
00:43:03.360,00:43:04.920,因为最终一定是事实,00:43:02.160,00:43:04.920,"In the end, we will find out that's the truth."
00:43:05.200,00:43:06.880,它形成一种大事,00:43:05.100,00:43:06.880,"It will form a general trend,"
00:43:06.920,00:43:08.600,然后是不可打败,00:43:06.920,00:43:08.840,and the trend will be unstoppable.
00:43:08.800,00:43:10.480,我在这里先插播一则,00:43:08.840,00:43:11.640,Let me share a news story a couple days ago.
00:43:10.480,00:43:11.640,前两天的新闻,,,
00:43:11.640,00:43:12.800,有一位先生,,,
00:43:12.800,00:43:13.920,他参加了一个,00:43:11.640,00:43:14.200,A man who made a call to
00:43:14.240,00:43:17.000,也是台湾的一个电台的直播节目,00:43:14.240,00:43:17.000,a live broadcast of a Taiwanese radio program.
00:43:17.000,00:43:17.480,他说,,,
00:43:17.520,00:43:18.400,他在宜兰生活,,,
00:43:18.400,00:43:18.720,后来,,,
00:43:19.080,00:43:20.800,又迁到了厦门,00:43:17.000,00:43:20.800,"He said he lived in Yilan, Taiwan and later moved to Xiamen, Fujian."
00:43:21.400,00:43:21.920,而且,,,
00:43:22.200,00:43:23.200,在座有人听过这个,00:43:21.300,00:43:24.080,"And…Oh, some of us here have heard this too."
00:43:23.240,00:43:23.960,对不对,,,
00:43:24.360,00:43:26.040,李先生你住哪里,00:43:24.360,00:43:26.040,"Mr Li, where do you live?"
00:43:26.080,00:43:26.720,我在厦门,00:43:26.080,00:43:27.240,I'm in Xiamen.
00:43:27.120,00:43:28.600,我是疑难过来厦门这边,00:43:27.240,00:43:29.260,I moved to Xiamen from Yilan.
00:43:28.840,00:43:31.720,我爸爸以前是民进党跟陈定南,00:43:29.260,00:43:32.900,My father joined the DPP with Chen Ding-nan.
00:43:31.760,00:43:32.080,一起,,,
00:43:32.080,00:43:32.720,加个明星,,,

00:43:34.400,00:43:35.880,他本来不想过来厦门的,00:43:34.420,00:43:36.120,"He didn't want to come to Xiamen before,"
00:43:35.880,00:43:38.120,后来去年我把他带过来了,00:43:36.120,00:43:38.340,but I brought him here last year.
00:43:38.640,00:43:39.440,带过来以后,,,
00:43:39.560,00:43:42.320,他现在他看到民事,00:43:38.640,00:43:43.000,"Since then, every time he watches Formosa TV (FTV) and Sanlih E-Television (SET)"
00:43:42.400,00:43:43.320,看到3D,,,
00:43:43.400,00:43:44.000,他去了,00:43:43.000,00:43:44.460, he gets furious!
00:43:44.000,00:43:46.160,要命叫我儿子叫我妈妈,00:43:44.460,00:43:47.400,"He forbids my son, mother, and uncle to watch them."
00:43:46.160,00:43:47.280,都叫我叔叔的,,,
00:43:47.280,00:43:48.320,不准看3D,00:43:47.400,00:43:49.100,No SET and no FTV!
00:43:48.320,00:43:50.200,不准看祢是那两个牌,,,
00:43:50.240,00:43:51.480,真的是叫Y小孩子,00:43:49.160,00:43:51.480,The two channels mislead our children
00:43:51.520,00:43:53.160,真的是乱七八糟报的,00:43:51.520,00:43:53.340,and spread fake news!
00:43:53.640,00:43:56.400,我们台湾给这些媒体搞坏的,00:43:53.640,00:43:56.400,These media really ruin Taiwan!
00:43:56.400,00:43:57.240,你先,00:43:56.400,00:43:57.580,"Mr. Li,"
00:43:57.480,00:43:58.720,你先别,00:43:57.580,00:44:00.240,"don't be so excited,"
00:43:58.760,00:43:58.880,别,,,
00:43:59.560,00:44:00.720,不要那么激动了,,,
00:44:00.760,00:44:03.400,所以在你们明年会回来投票就对,00:44:00.760,00:44:03.920,Will you come back next year to vote?
00:44:03.400,00:44:03.920,了,,,
00:44:04.280,00:44:06.440,我现在不只回去投票,00:44:04.280,00:44:06.440,I don't just go back to vote.
00:44:06.440,00:44:07.920,我家族有70多个人,00:44:06.440,00:44:08.280,There are more than 70 people in my family.
00:44:07.920,00:44:10.080,我不准投给邻近,,,
00:44:10.080,00:44:10.440,答,,,
00:44:10.480,00:44:12.800,不管是谁不准投民进党,00:44:08.560,00:44:12.680,"No matter who they are, they are not allowed to vote for the DPP!"
00:44:12.800,00:44:13.560,投给民进党,,,
00:44:13.560,00:44:15.120,我就跟他半截关系,00:44:12.680,00:44:15.160,I will break up with them if anyone votes for the DPP.
00:44:15.160,00:44:16.880,也是民进党的,00:44:15.280,00:44:16.940,"The more they pro DPP they were,"
00:44:16.880,00:44:18.320,一过来大陆以后,00:44:16.940,00:44:19.560,"the less they want to vote for the DPP
once they come to the mainland,"
00:44:18.320,00:44:19.120,又不想投,,,
00:44:19.120,00:44:19.560,民进党,,,
00:44:19.600,00:44:20.280,越想同意,,,
00:44:20.320,00:44:21.040,你知道不知道,00:44:19.600,00:44:21.780,"and the more they want to reunify, do you understand?"
00:44:21.720,00:44:22.440,大家都注意到,,,
00:44:22.440,00:44:23.480,有这样一则新闻,00:44:21.780,00:44:23.480,So we've noticed this in the news.
00:44:23.520,00:44:24.160,但反过来说,,,
00:44:24.200,00:44:25.400,我也想问问黄女士,00:44:23.520,00:44:26.320,"About this question, I want to ask Ms Huang,"
00:44:25.720,00:44:27.720,通常刚才我们这位朋友也问这个,,,
00:44:27.720,00:44:28.080,问题,00:44:26.320,00:44:29.760,as we hope to learn more about each other through communication.
00:44:28.120,00:44:29.760,希望大家通过交流,,,
00:44:29.760,00:44:31.360,能够更多的去了解对方,,,
00:44:31.360,00:44:32.200,尤其台湾地区,00:44:29.760,00:44:34.640,"Especially for our friends in Taiwan to open their eyes to see the mainland, their homeland."
00:44:32.240,00:44:32.800,睁开眼睛,,,
00:44:32.800,00:44:34.080,可以来看大陆,,,
00:44:34.120,00:44:34.760,看祖国,,,
00:44:34.840,00:44:36.200,在这种情况下,00:44:34.840,00:44:37.360,"From your perspective,"
00:44:36.200,00:44:37.360,根据您的了解,,,
00:44:37.360,00:44:38.800,他们是怎样的一种,00:44:37.360,00:44:39.520,how would they react [to mainland's growth]?
00:44:38.840,00:44:39.520,反应,,,
00:44:40.440,00:44:41.680,应该说,00:44:40.260,00:44:41.680,I should say
00:44:41.880,00:44:44.520,百%都会被震撼,00:44:41.880,00:44:44.520,100% of them would be shocked.
00:44:44.960,00:44:46.280,大陆是基建狂魔,00:44:44.960,00:44:47.020,"The mainland is the ""infrastructure monster""."
00:44:46.960,00:44:49.240,我们台湾连盖一条马路,00:44:47.020,00:44:50.880,But it can take more than ten years to build a road in Taiwan.
00:44:49.240,00:44:50.880,可能都搞十几年不,,,
00:44:51.120,00:44:53.120,不但是高铁搞很久,,,
00:44:53.120,00:44:54.240,不但是地铁,00:44:51.120,00:44:55.680,"Not only high-speed rail or subway,
even a road can take a long time."
00:44:54.240,00:44:54.520,搞完球,,,
00:44:54.520,00:44:56.040,连开一条马路都会搞很久,,,
00:44:56.040,00:44:56.800,为什么,00:44:55.680,00:44:56.800,Why?
00:44:56.800,00:44:58.840,因为各种各样的利益冲突,00:44:56.800,00:44:58.840,Because of various conflicts of interest.
00:44:59.440,00:45:00.720,马路要经过我家,00:44:59.320,00:45:01.720,"The road has to pass by my house,
so my land will appreciate in value."
00:45:00.760,00:45:01.760,所以我土地要涨,,,
00:45:01.800,00:45:03.920,可是不能够从我家的田里面挖,00:45:01.800,00:45:04.320,But not through my crop fields.
00:45:03.920,00:45:04.560,过来,,,
00:45:04.600,00:45:06.240,要从我家旁边这样绕,00:45:04.600,00:45:06.240,It must bypass my home.
00:45:06.280,00:45:06.760,好,,,
00:45:07.040,00:45:07.760,我想这样,00:45:06.280,00:45:07.880,"Okay, I want this,"
00:45:07.920,00:45:08.880,你也想那样,00:45:07.920,00:45:08.960,and you want that.
00:45:08.880,00:45:10.280,我们就去努力去比拼,00:45:08.960,00:45:10.280,Let's compete.
00:45:10.280,00:45:11.240,我们去找议员,,,
00:45:11.240,00:45:12.120,你去找议员,00:45:10.440,00:45:12.180,I'll go see this PM and you ask that PM.
00:45:12.120,00:45:12.960,然后大家弄,,,
00:45:12.960,00:45:13.840,然后最后,,,
00:45:14.000,00:45:15.200,所以最后弄来弄去,00:45:12.180,00:45:16.320,"A few rounds later, when the mayor's term is over,"
00:45:15.240,00:45:17.200,然后等到市长任期也差不多,,,
00:45:17.240,00:45:18.120,他下台走了,00:45:16.500,00:45:19.800,we start all over again.
00:45:18.280,00:45:19.840,我要重新又来一次,,,
00:45:19.960,00:45:21.080,所以就永远在里面,00:45:19.960,00:45:22.040,So it can take forever.
00:45:21.080,00:45:22.040,搞好,,,
00:45:22.080,00:45:23.600,每一个百%的,,,
00:45:23.600,00:45:25.480,台湾人到大陆,00:45:22.080,00:45:26.680,Every Taiwanese coming to the mainland will be impressed.
00:45:25.480,00:45:26.680,他都会震撼,,,
00:45:26.680,00:45:28.000,第1个是大陆的进步,,,
00:45:28.040,00:45:29.600,跟他过去跟民进党宣传,00:45:26.680,00:45:29.700,"Firstly, the development of the mainland is shockingly different from"
00:45:29.640,00:45:32.280,跟他在台湾媒体上所看到,00:45:29.700,00:45:33.880,"DPP's propaganda media coverage, 99% of which is negative."
00:45:32.320,00:45:34.200,99%都是负面的,,,
00:45:34.240,00:45:35.240,为什么不一样,00:45:34.240,00:45:35.680,Why so different?
00:45:35.240,00:45:35.760,好,,,
00:45:35.960,00:45:37.840,第2个是文化的震撼,00:45:35.960,00:45:37.840,"Secondly, the cultural shock."
00:45:37.840,00:45:39.280,就有一个台独的人,00:45:37.840,00:45:39.280,I have told this joke many times.
00:45:39.280,00:45:41.200,他到厦门去这个笑话,00:45:39.280,00:45:40.660,It is a real story.
00:45:41.200,00:45:41.960,我讲过很多次,,,
00:45:41.960,00:45:43.160,就真正的一个故事,00:45:40.860,00:45:44.780,"A ""Taiwan separatist"" came to Xiamen,
and messaged his friends on Line -"
00:45:43.160,00:45:45.320,他马上就传赖台湾,,,
00:45:45.320,00:45:46.520,是用烂不用为钱,00:45:44.780,00:45:47.240,Taiwan uses Line instead of WeChat.
00:45:46.920,00:45:47.400,他是做,,,
00:45:48.520,00:45:50.280,厦门人也会讲台湾话,00:45:47.800,00:45:50.660,He said Xiamen also speaks Taiwanese!
00:45:51.160,00:45:53.920,但等到他后来回来台湾之后,00:45:51.160,00:45:53.920,"When he returned to Taiwan,"
00:45:54.000,00:45:55.240,他当然知道,,,
00:45:55.240,00:45:57.040,原来我们就是中国人,00:45:54.000,00:45:57.040,"of course, he knew that we are all Chinese."
00:45:57.040,00:45:57.360,好,,,
00:45:57.360,00:45:59.240,可是这碰到问题来了,00:45:57.040,00:45:59.520,But here comes the problem.
00:45:59.880,00:46:01.040,去年选举的时候,00:45:59.520,00:46:01.080,"In the election last year,"
00:46:01.040,00:46:02.600,民进党有一个议员,,,
00:46:02.600,00:46:05.000,因为绯闻被弄出来,00:46:01.080,00:46:05.000,a DPP PM had a scandal when a recording was leaked.
00:46:05.040,00:46:06.760,然后他在录音里面讲什么,,,
00:46:06.760,00:46:07.560,他是民进党的,00:46:05.040,00:46:08.740,"As a DPP member, he supports ""Taiwan independence""."
00:46:08.240,00:46:09.360,就主张台独,,,
00:46:09.360,00:46:11.360,他跟他的女朋友讲说,00:46:08.760,00:46:11.360,"In the recording, he told his girlfriend,"
00:46:11.520,00:46:12.040,你不知道,,,
00:46:12.040,00:46:13.600,我这次我要出来选,,,
00:46:13.600,00:46:15.560,就是我一定要靠着我民,00:46:11.520,00:46:16.000,"""You don't know, I must rely on my DPP membership wo win this election."""
00:46:15.600,00:46:16.800,民进党的身份,,,
00:46:16.920,00:46:18.320,我当选,00:46:16.000,00:46:20.540,"""Once I'm elected, I can 'walk with winds' on the mainland."""
00:46:18.480,00:46:20.680,我知道大陆走路就有风,,,
00:46:21.920,00:46:22.800,懂吗,00:46:21.440,00:46:22.800,You understand?
00:46:23.120,00:46:24.480,很多民进党的人,,,
00:46:24.520,00:46:26.200,他常常跑大陆,00:46:23.120,00:46:26.200,Many DPP people often come to the mainland.
00:46:26.720,00:46:29.760,他事实上他知道是怎么回事,00:46:26.720,00:46:29.840,"Clearly, they know what's going on here,"
00:46:29.760,00:46:31.960,可是因为他自己培养了,00:46:29.840,00:46:34.080,"but they have cultivated a group of ""political customers""."
00:46:32.000,00:46:34.080,一群政治的消费者,,,
00:46:34.080,00:46:36.200,他就是喜欢听你骂大陆,00:46:34.080,00:46:36.200,The customers like to hear you cursing the mainland.
00:46:36.200,00:46:37.680,他就是喜欢台独的,00:46:36.200,00:46:37.900,"They only like ""Taiwan independence"" [ideas]."
00:46:37.720,00:46:40.120,然后所以就变成台独两面人,00:46:37.900,00:46:40.120,So the PM became a  double-faced separatist.
00:46:40.120,00:46:41.600,就像民进党有一个市议员,00:46:40.120,00:46:43.080,"For example, a DPP city councilor surnamed Tong,"
00:46:41.600,00:46:43.080,叫姓童的,,,
00:46:43.120,00:46:44.040,上沙到大陆,,,
00:46:44.080,00:46:45.000,他就唱,00:46:43.240,00:46:47.200,"He sings ""We are brothers"" whenever he comes to the mainland,"
00:46:45.640,00:46:46.720,你是兄来,,,
00:46:46.760,00:46:47.360,我是第,,,
00:46:47.880,00:46:48.960,我们是好哥们,00:46:47.620,00:46:49.240,"""We are good brothers."""
00:46:49.560,00:46:50.520,然后回到台湾,,,
00:46:50.520,00:46:51.480,就继续码大,00:46:49.560,00:46:51.840,"Once he returns to Taiwan,
his curses on the mainland continue."
00:46:52.240,00:46:53.320,就变成这样子,00:46:51.900,00:46:53.320,This is where we are.
00:46:53.320,00:46:54.360,所以到底有没有用,00:46:53.320,00:46:54.500,"So, in the end, does that work?"
00:46:54.520,00:46:55.360,台湾到现在,,,
00:46:55.360,00:46:57.200,有2/3的台湾人,00:46:54.520,00:46:56.740,About 2/3 Taiwanese people
00:46:57.240,00:46:58.520,没有来过大陆,00:46:56.740,00:46:58.580,haven’t been to the mainland.
00:46:58.920,00:47:00.560,当然越多人来越好,00:46:58.580,00:47:00.560,"The more Taiwanese visit, the better."
00:47:00.600,00:47:01.800,可是很独詹欢,,,
00:47:01.800,00:47:03.000,大陆的年轻人,,,
00:47:03.000,00:47:04.280,他就留在大陆了,00:47:00.600,00:47:06.700,"Many pro-mainland young Taiwanese would stay here to study, work, and start a family."
00:47:04.600,00:47:07.120,读书工作成家立业,,,
00:47:07.120,00:47:08.800,但是投票选举的时候,00:47:06.980,00:47:09.080,"When the election is coming,"
00:47:08.800,00:47:09.960,他回去一次投票,,,
00:47:09.960,00:47:11.680,他花太多钱太多成本,00:47:09.080,00:47:11.680,going home just for the election can be expensive for them.
00:47:11.720,00:47:13.400,他反而不回去投票了,00:47:11.720,00:47:13.400,So they choose not to return and vote.
00:47:13.400,00:47:14.680,所以越了解大陆的,00:47:13.400,00:47:15.860,These people understand and identify with the mainland
00:47:14.680,00:47:15.960,越认同大陆的,,,
00:47:15.960,00:47:17.280,越反台独人,00:47:15.960,00:47:18.260,and are against separatism. They all stay here.
00:47:17.280,00:47:18.400,都留在大陆的,,,
00:47:18.400,00:47:19.560,台独更高兴,00:47:18.260,00:47:19.740,The separatists are happy to see this.
00:47:19.560,00:47:20.400,你们赶快回去,,,
00:47:20.400,00:47:21.560,都不要来回来投票,00:47:19.740,00:47:21.680,"""Go to your motherland, don’t vote here!"""
00:47:21.560,00:47:24.240,所以留在台湾就更绿更毒了,00:47:21.680,00:47:25.300,"As a result, the population in Taiwan becomes greener [more pro-DPP] and more pro-independence."
00:47:24.280,00:47:25.080,所以,,,
00:47:26.320,00:47:27.040,很难解,00:47:25.300,00:47:27.920,This issue is hard to address.
00:47:27.040,00:47:27.920,就是这样子,,,
00:47:27.960,00:47:28.120,对,,,
00:47:28.160,00:47:30.840,但我想借机问黄王女士一个问题,00:47:28.160,00:47:30.840,"I want to take the opportunity to ask Ms. Huang a question,"
00:47:30.960,00:47:31.680,也就刚才,,,
00:47:31.720,00:47:33.320,张教授提出的一种情况,00:47:30.960,00:47:33.320,which relates to the situation introduced by Professor Zhang.
00:47:33.320,00:47:33.640,比如,,,
00:47:33.680,00:47:34.440,说在,00:47:33.320,00:47:34.440,"For example,"
00:47:34.600,00:47:36.200,几年前我们看到,,,
00:47:36.240,00:47:38.400,到大陆的一些影视电视剧,00:47:34.600,00:47:39.380,a few years ago we saw some mainland movies and TV dramas gained popularity in Taiwan.
00:47:38.440,00:47:39.800,据作品在台湾也热播,,,
00:47:40.000,00:47:40.400,当,,,
00:47:40.440,00:47:41.240,是我们觉得,00:47:40.000,00:47:42.240,"At that time, we thought it might be"
00:47:41.280,00:47:41.520,样式,,,
00:47:41.520,00:47:43.040,是不是我们的文化,,,
00:47:43.080,00:47:44.760,能有办法跨过海峡,00:47:42.240,00:47:45.720,our culture products were able to influence our compatriots across the strait.
00:47:44.760,00:47:45.720,影响我们的同胞,,,
00:47:46.280,00:47:47.800,现在更多的出现的情况,00:47:46.280,00:47:49.040,"Now it is more often, as you said,"
00:47:47.800,00:47:49.040,正如您所讲,,,
00:47:49.640,00:47:50.080,他们,,,
00:47:50.120,00:47:51.920,为自己的认同自己是台湾人,00:47:49.240,00:47:52.840,they will identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.
00:47:51.920,00:47:52.840,而不是中国人,,,
00:47:52.840,00:47:54.760,我们认为大陆过去的文化作品,00:47:52.840,00:47:56.620,"Our cultural products are seen as coming from another country,"
00:47:54.760,00:47:55.720,他觉得是来自于,,,
00:47:55.760,00:47:57.120,另外一个国家的东西,,,
00:47:57.320,00:47:58.200,他无非就跟,,,
00:47:58.240,00:47:58.760,本的东西,00:47:57.320,00:47:59.840,just like the ones from Japan or the US.
00:47:58.760,00:47:59.840,跟美国东西一样,,,
00:47:59.880,00:48:01.000,我就把它当成一种,,,
00:48:01.000,00:48:02.960,舶来的文化品来看,00:47:59.880,00:48:02.960,Considered as imported cultural products.
00:48:03.280,00:48:04.600,这个时候岂不是很危险,00:48:03.280,00:48:04.600,Isn't it dangerous by this mean?
00:48:04.800,00:48:06.240,我们的这种文化影响力,00:48:04.800,00:48:07.440,Can our cultural influence continue?
00:48:06.240,00:48:07.440,还能不能继续,,,
00:48:07.480,00:48:10.120,文化影响力肯定是越来越大,00:48:07.480,00:48:10.120,The cultural influence is definitely growing.
00:48:10.160,00:48:13.600,台湾的女孩子上淘宝买东西,00:48:10.160,00:48:13.600,Taiwanese girls shop on Taobao.
00:48:13.800,00:48:14.920,然后台湾女性,00:48:13.800,00:48:15.480,"Taiwanese women, I can say that they may have watched"
00:48:14.960,00:48:15.480,我可以说,,,
00:48:15.520,00:48:16.520,她甄嬛传,,,
00:48:16.560,00:48:19.200,可能最多可能看三十遍,00:48:15.520,00:48:20.080,"""Empresses in the Palace""
for 30 times, 40 times, 50 times."
00:48:19.240,00:48:20.200,四十遍五十遍,,,
00:48:20.200,00:48:22.840,光电视上就已经重播一百多次,00:48:20.200,00:48:22.840,The series has been rebroadcast 100 times on TV.
00:48:22.960,00:48:23.800,这是有史以来,,,
00:48:23.800,00:48:25.680,台湾女孩子最喜欢看的,00:48:22.960,00:48:25.720,"This is the most popular drama
with Taiwanese girls."
00:48:25.840,00:48:27.760,但我仍然必须讲,,,
00:48:28.240,00:48:29.800,包括很多男生喜欢看的,00:48:26.220,00:48:32.400,"Guys might be fond of mainland dramas such as ""Three Kingdoms""."
00:48:29.840,00:48:30.640,各种各样的,,,
00:48:30.640,00:48:32.400,据三国志或者什么,,,
00:48:32.440,00:48:34.560,但是我仍然必须说,00:48:32.440,00:48:34.300,"However,  I must say that"
00:48:34.560,00:48:35.440,那跟国族认同,00:48:34.300,00:48:36.520,it is still different from having a national identity.
00:48:35.440,00:48:36.520,仍然是不一样的,,,
00:48:36.720,00:48:38.240,一到关卡点,00:48:36.720,00:48:39.760,"Once it comes to national identity,"
00:48:38.240,00:48:39.400,你又回到你的国族,,,
00:48:39.400,00:48:42.000,认同你到40岁以上的台湾人,00:48:39.760,00:48:44.200,"Most Taiwanese over 40, identify themselves as Chinese."
00:48:42.360,00:48:43.840,认同自己是中国人,,,
00:48:43.840,00:48:45.720,就多到50岁以上的人,,,
00:48:45.720,00:48:47.120,可能七成八成的人,00:48:44.200,00:48:48.520,"For the 50s, 70% to 80% may think they are Chinese."
00:48:47.120,00:48:48.520,都认为自己是中国人,,,
00:48:48.560,00:48:49.800,所以就没有办法,00:48:48.560,00:48:50.320,Can't do anything about it.
00:48:50.320,00:48:51.280,怎么去刑诉,,,
00:48:51.320,00:48:53.000,一个人的国族认同,00:48:50.320,00:48:53.000,How do you shape a person's national identity?
00:48:53.040,00:48:55.600,真的就是教科书,00:48:53.040,00:48:58.000,"Their textbook is the answer, and the power of the government."
00:48:55.800,00:48:58.000,真的就是执政的力量,,,
00:48:58.120,00:48:59.640,台湾的民进党当局,,,
00:48:59.640,00:49:00.440,苦心孤诣,00:48:58.120,00:49:01.300,"The DPP authorities ""diligently"" - in quotation marks -"
00:49:00.560,00:49:01.680,我们给它加个双赢,,,
00:49:02.040,00:49:03.200,要去中国化,00:49:01.300,00:49:03.140,"trying to ""de-Sinicize""."
00:49:03.240,00:49:04.480,除了动教科书之外,,,
00:49:04.480,00:49:06.080,他做了很多的功课,00:49:03.240,00:49:05.980,They did a lot in addition to modifying textbooks.
00:49:06.080,00:49:07.040,特别重要的一点,,,
00:49:07.080,00:49:07.920,就是故宫,,,
00:49:07.920,00:49:10.120,刚才其实您也提到了一点点,00:49:06.080,00:49:09.900,"The most important one is The Forbidden City, as you mentioned earlier."
00:49:10.160,00:49:11.800,日本有位记者叫野导纲,00:49:10.160,00:49:12.780,"A Japanese journalist named Nojima Tsuyosh,"
00:49:11.840,00:49:13.000,以前的一位记者,,,
00:49:13.040,00:49:14.480,后来他变成了作家,00:49:12.780,00:49:14.480,who later became a writer.
00:49:14.520,00:49:16.120,他专门写过故宫的故事,,,
00:49:16.120,00:49:17.720,叫两个故宫的离合,00:49:14.520,00:49:17.820,"He wrote a story about The  Forbidden City,
called ""The Separation of the Two Old Palace""."
00:49:17.800,00:49:19.480,他在里面还特别追踪故宫,,,
00:49:19.680,00:49:21.760,尤其是台北故宫博物院,00:49:17.820,00:49:22.740,He traced the stories of Taipei's Palace Museum.
00:49:21.800,00:49:23.000,如今的状况,,,
00:49:23.320,00:49:25.560,台湾民进党当局很努力的,,,
00:49:25.560,00:49:27.920,要给故宫开一个嘉义南苑,00:49:23.320,00:49:28.060,DPP  is working hard to open a Chiayi South museum in addition to the Tapei museum.
00:49:27.960,00:49:28.400,对不对,,,
00:49:28.400,00:49:30.360,他为什么要开嘉义南院,00:49:28.400,00:49:30.360,But why?
00:49:30.360,00:49:32.120,因为他就要切断,,,
00:49:32.320,00:49:33.840,在故宫里面陈列的,00:49:30.360,00:49:34.280,Because they want to remove the objects representing the Chinese civilization
00:49:33.840,00:49:34.280,许多,,,
00:49:34.280,00:49:36.760,代表中华文明的物质,00:49:34.280,00:49:36.900,which are displayed in the Taipei museum.
00:49:36.960,00:49:40.240,他要把台湾的这些代表,00:49:36.960,00:49:42.200,They want to exhibit the relics of native Taiwan
00:49:40.240,00:49:42.200,所谓台湾本土文化的文物,,,
00:49:42.200,00:49:43.880,跟东南亚的文物,,,
00:49:43.880,00:49:45.320,跟日本的文物,00:49:42.200,00:49:46.260,together with the relics from Southeast Asia and Japan
00:49:45.320,00:49:46.120,都放在一起,,,
00:49:46.160,00:49:47.840,陈列在加一的故宫,00:49:46.260,00:49:48.200,in the new Chiayi museum.
00:49:47.840,00:49:48.200,南院,,,
00:49:48.200,00:49:48.880,要让大家觉得,,,
00:49:49.040,00:49:50.920,台湾是亚洲文化的一个部分,00:49:48.200,00:49:50.920,They are trying to make everyone feel that Taiwanese is part of Asia
00:49:50.920,00:49:52.360,但是他要深深的割裂,,,
00:49:52.360,00:49:53.680,整个中华文明,00:49:50.920,00:49:55.140,by cutting off its ties with the Chinese civilization.
00:49:53.680,00:49:55.440,源远流长的表现,,,
00:49:55.480,00:49:56.280,所以大家注意到,,,
00:49:56.320,00:49:57.360,他们的努力,00:49:55.480,00:49:57.340,"So everyone noticed their ""efforts"""
00:49:57.560,00:49:58.760,我们要加双引号,00:49:57.340,00:49:58.760,"- again, in quotation marks -"
00:49:58.760,00:50:00.200,真的不光在教科书上,,,
00:50:00.200,00:50:01.320,在文化上,00:49:58.760,00:50:03.100,is not only in textbooks but also in culture and many other aspects.
00:50:01.360,00:50:03.600,在很多方方面面的细节上,,,
00:50:03.640,00:50:05.520,这个是我们非常需要警惕的,00:50:03.640,00:50:05.520,We need to be vigilant about this.
00:50:05.520,00:50:06.760,但就像黄女士说的,,,
00:50:06.800,00:50:08.280,在台湾他就是这么做了,00:50:05.520,00:50:08.320,"But as Ms. Huang said, they have already been doing these in Taiwan."
00:50:08.320,00:50:09.040,这也是让大家,,,
00:50:09.040,00:50:10.600,非常着急的一个地方,00:50:08.320,00:50:10.600,That's why we feel concerned.
00:50:10.600,00:50:11.760,我们接下来再来看看,,,
00:50:11.760,00:50:12.080,现场,,,
00:50:12.080,00:50:12.880,还有没有,00:50:10.600,00:50:14.040,Let's see if we have any more questions from the audience. All are Welcomed.
00:50:12.920,00:50:14.040,朋友要提问,,,
00:50:14.720,00:50:15.880,对来欢迎,00:50:14.720,00:50:16.200,"Yes, please."
00:50:16.200,00:50:18.040,刚才老师刚才也提到过,00:50:16.200,00:50:19.160,You talked about the issue of voting.
00:50:18.280,00:50:19.160,选票的问题,,,
00:50:19.160,00:50:20.400,就是我的问题是,00:50:19.160,00:50:20.660,My question is ...
00:50:20.680,00:50:21.840,我们经常能够看到,,,
00:50:21.880,00:50:23.640,一种很矛盾的现象,00:50:20.680,00:50:23.640,We can often see a very contradictory phenomenon.
00:50:24.040,00:50:25.800,他台湾地区的领导人,00:50:24.040,00:50:26.840,"When any leader of Taiwan was in office,"
00:50:25.800,00:50:26.840,每人在任的时候,,,
00:50:27.400,00:50:28.280,各种民调显示,,,
00:50:28.320,00:50:29.680,其实他的支持率都不高的,00:50:27.180,00:50:30.820,various polls showed that their approval ratings were low.
00:50:29.680,00:50:31.120,甚至有的是很低,,,
00:50:31.160,00:50:33.040,但是每每到他这种选举,00:50:31.160,00:50:34.200,"But whenever there was an election or a change of term,"
00:50:33.120,00:50:34.200,或者换届的时候,,,
00:50:34.240,00:50:37.600,他能用一些千奇百怪的方式,00:50:34.240,00:50:38.720,they could find their ways to get themselves re-elected.
00:50:37.640,00:50:38.720,然后获得连任,,,
00:50:39.080,00:50:40.040,我的问题就想问问,,,
00:50:40.040,00:50:42.080,就是说他的这种结果,00:50:39.080,00:50:44.560,My question is: What is the underlying reason for this result?
00:50:42.080,00:50:44.560,造成结果的深层次原因是什么,,,
00:50:44.640,00:50:46.160,还有他到底这种结果,,,
00:50:46.160,00:50:47.880,是不是真的是反映出来,00:50:44.640,00:50:50.440,Does this result truly reflect the public opinion in Taiwan?
00:50:47.880,00:50:48.360,一个,,,
00:50:48.400,00:50:50.440,台湾人民的民意,,,
00:50:51.600,00:50:52.160,请坐,,,
00:50:52.160,00:50:53.240,也是一个好问题,00:50:51.600,00:50:53.460,Please sit down.  Also a good question.
00:50:53.400,00:50:55.040,民调跟最终的选举结果,00:50:53.460,00:50:55.180,The difference between polls and results …
00:50:55.080,00:50:56.560,包括台湾民调,00:50:55.320,00:50:58.480,Taiwan's polls can have all kinds of results.
00:50:57.600,00:50:59.000,各种各样的结果,,,
00:50:59.080,00:51:00.280,所以我记得前两天,,,
00:51:00.360,00:51:02.360,国台办发言人在回答问题,00:50:59.080,00:51:03.420,"A coupled days ago, on the press conference of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council."
00:51:02.360,00:51:02.840,就说的,,,
00:51:03.480,00:51:03.880,提问的,,,
00:51:03.880,00:51:04.760,台湾记者说,,,
00:51:04.800,00:51:05.920,多少张民调说明,00:51:03.420,00:51:08.320,Some Taiwan reporter(s) said some polls showed that Taiwanese people do not support reunification.
00:51:05.960,00:51:08.640,不支持统一台湾,,,
00:51:08.680,00:51:10.160,我们的国台办的发言说,00:51:08.680,00:51:10.300,"The spokesperson replied,"
00:51:10.200,00:51:11.040,我们知道,,,
00:51:11.040,00:51:13.720,你们台湾制造民调的能力,00:51:10.300,00:51:13.720,we are aware of Taiwan media's ability to produce opinion polls.
00:51:13.720,00:51:15.280,就各方面你要什么结果,00:51:13.720,00:51:16.520,You can produce any results you want.
00:51:15.280,00:51:16.520,都可以制造出来,,,
00:51:16.560,00:51:19.480,所以这个性可信度不是十分高,00:51:16.560,00:51:19.480,They are not very credible.
00:51:19.680,00:51:22.440,另外台湾选举政治的发展,00:51:19.680,00:51:24.400,"Besides, Taiwan electoral politics now faces an issue."
00:51:22.920,00:51:24.400,现在出现一个什么情况,,,
00:51:25.360,00:51:26.880,像很多其他地方,00:51:25.360,00:51:28.160,Many other places also have such problems.
00:51:26.920,00:51:28.160,也有这样的问题,,,
00:51:29.480,00:51:30.920,叫做中间选民,00:51:29.480,00:51:30.920,It is called the median voter.
00:51:31.200,00:51:34.040,过去是蓝绿两大块I为主,00:51:31.200,00:51:34.040,"Previously, blue or green were the majority,"
00:51:34.040,00:51:36.120,现在是中间选民为主,00:51:34.040,00:51:36.120,but now it is the median voter.
00:51:36.560,00:51:38.320,我看到最新的一个分析,00:51:36.560,00:51:39.580,"I saw the latest analysis,
using Taipei as an example."
00:51:38.320,00:51:39.640,大概以台北为例,,,
00:51:39.800,00:51:41.960,过去比方说台北市偏蓝的,00:51:39.800,00:51:43.400,Taipei used to mainly be blue - supporting KMT.
00:51:42.320,00:51:43.400,偏国民党的,,,
00:51:43.800,00:51:47.160,那么现在大概是蓝绿还是蓝多,00:51:43.800,00:51:48.200,"Now it is 30% Blue, 20%Green -"
00:51:47.160,00:51:47.360,一点,,,
00:51:47.400,00:51:48.680,可能30%,,,
00:51:48.720,00:51:48.920,率,,,
00:51:48.920,00:51:49.840,可能20%,,,
00:51:49.880,00:51:51.320,另外50中间选民,00:51:48.520,00:51:51.940,so the other 50% is the median voters.
00:51:52.160,00:51:53.160,随着选举结果,,,
00:51:53.160,00:51:55.560,往往取决于最后中间选民怎么,00:51:52.160,00:51:55.940,"In the end, election results often depend on
the median voters."
00:51:55.600,00:51:56.080,投票,,,
00:51:56.800,00:51:58.520,所以就要研究,,,
00:51:58.520,00:52:02.080,就中间选民的人群结构,00:51:56.800,00:52:00.580,It requires studying the population structure
00:52:02.320,00:52:03.600,投票的偏好,00:52:00.580,00:52:03.620,and voting preferences of the median voters.
00:52:03.960,00:52:05.880,我觉得这也是民主制度,00:52:03.960,00:52:07.600,"I think this is also a huge dilemma for ""democratic systems""."
00:52:05.880,00:52:07.600,本身的巨大的困境,,,
00:52:07.960,00:52:10.280,因为从我们现在初步研究来看,00:52:07.960,00:52:10.280,"According to our preliminary research,"
00:52:10.280,00:52:12.400,这中间选民的偏好,,,
00:52:12.440,00:52:15.360,因为他结构可能是年轻人比较多,00:52:10.980,00:52:14.000,the structure of  median voters:
00:52:15.480,00:52:17.880,对政治不是特别的感兴趣,00:52:14.000,00:52:17.880,they are mainly young people and not particularly interested in politics.
00:52:17.880,00:52:20.200,那么然后偏好往往是,,,
00:52:20.520,00:52:22.680,当时比方选举那一天,00:52:17.980,00:52:24.520,"In terms of preferences, incidents happening on the day of the election, or a week or three weeks before,"
00:52:22.680,00:52:27.120,或者三个礼拜前一个月发生的,,,
00:52:27.120,00:52:27.840,事情,00:52:24.700,00:52:29.640,or a month before -  often affect them significantly.
00:52:27.880,00:52:29.640,会对他有特别大的影响,,,
00:52:29.680,00:52:31.560,就是前面讲陈水扁,00:52:29.680,00:52:31.720,"As you mentioned,"
00:52:31.560,00:52:32.760,04年那一枪,,,
00:52:32.800,00:52:33.800,一下就改变了,00:52:31.720,00:52:36.280,the 3-19 shooting changed Chen Shui-bian's election immediately.
00:52:34.480,00:52:36.280,就一个世界,,,
00:52:36.640,00:52:38.880,2004年两颗子弹,00:52:36.640,00:52:38.880,The two bullets in 2004 -
00:52:39.080,00:52:42.640,到投票前一天下午1点多,00:52:39.080,00:52:43.300,I was watching TV at 1pm the day before voting.
00:52:42.640,00:52:44.880,我在看着电视突然间胖,00:52:43.300,00:52:45.240,"All out of suddenly, bang!"
00:52:44.880,00:52:47.000,然后开始跑马灯,00:52:45.240,00:52:47.120,then the News ticker started to roll...
00:52:47.040,00:52:48.760,那个时候这也可以,00:52:47.120,00:52:48.760,That's even OK?
00:52:48.760,00:52:50.280,我当时我就说,,,
00:52:50.280,00:52:52.520,阿扁你真会玩对,00:52:48.760,00:52:52.440,"I said: Chen Shui-bian, well played!"
00:52:52.560,00:52:54.760,然后连美国人都骂你,00:52:52.440,00:52:55.140,Even the Americans felt the same.
00:52:54.760,00:52:55.520,真会玩,,,
00:52:55.520,00:52:57.880,大家都知道他在玩,00:52:55.520,00:52:59.120,"Everybody knew he was playing [a trick],
but what could we do?"
00:52:58.080,00:53:00.120,可是你怎么办2016年,,,
00:53:00.120,00:53:01.000,2016年,00:52:59.120,00:53:02.560,There was also a very dramatic twist in 2016.
00:53:01.040,00:53:02.560,也是一个很戏剧性的效果,,,
00:53:02.560,00:53:04.840,当时操弄什么2016年,00:53:02.560,00:53:04.840,What were they playing in 2016?
00:53:04.840,00:53:06.480,那时候我节目直播投票,00:53:04.840,00:53:07.740,"The night before voting,
my show was on broadcast until 10pm."
00:53:06.480,00:53:07.960,前一天晚上到10:00,,,
00:53:07.960,00:53:09.680,我们是10:00以后,,,
00:53:09.720,00:53:10.520,晚上10:00以后,00:53:07.960,00:53:12.720,"After 10 pm, no election-related activities were allowed."
00:53:10.520,00:53:12.720,不能够有任何的助学行为了,,,
00:53:12.720,00:53:14.080,结果没想到,,,
00:53:14.280,00:53:15.720,周子瑜女明星,,,
00:53:16.000,00:53:16.840,台湾女明星,00:53:12.720,00:53:20.420,I did not expect the videotape of Taiwanese actress Zhou Tzuyu to be broadcast intentionally
00:53:16.840,00:53:18.680,周子瑜的录影带,,,
00:53:18.680,00:53:21.080,就被刻意的在10点多的时候,,,
00:53:21.080,00:53:23.120,放在全台湾网路,00:53:20.660,00:53:24.600,on Taiwan Internet and TV networks after 10 pm.
00:53:23.120,00:53:24.600,跟电视一一直播,,,
00:53:24.640,00:53:26.120,可爱的美少女,,,
00:53:26.160,00:53:27.800,楚楚可怜的,00:53:24.640,00:53:30.020,"A lovely beautiful girl, all tearfully,
saying she was ""bullied"" by China's communist party."
00:53:27.840,00:53:29.920,然后被中共欺负了,,,
00:53:30.040,00:53:31.040,然后在那边说,,,
00:53:31.040,00:53:32.880,我是中国人,00:53:30.040,00:53:33.140,"On the taps, she said ""I'm Chinese""."
00:53:33.240,00:53:35.640,台湾人宅男们就受不了,00:53:33.240,00:53:35.640,The Taiwanese otaku guys couldn't stand it.
00:53:35.640,00:53:37.200,所以第2天投票的时候,,,
00:53:37.240,00:53:40.400,宅男总动员全部回来,00:53:35.640,00:53:40.400,"The second day it was an ""otaku walk-out"" to vote."
00:53:40.640,00:53:41.800,是不是投给民进党,00:53:40.640,00:53:42.940,Their votes were not for the DPP or the New Power Party.
00:53:41.800,00:53:42.880,也不是投给时代的钥匙,,,
00:53:42.880,00:53:44.200,朝头给周子瑜,00:53:42.940,00:53:44.800,Their votes were for Zhou Tzuyu.
00:53:45.000,00:53:47.840,他就用周子瑜就调动了,00:53:45.000,00:53:47.840,They utilized Zhou Tzuyu to mobilize people.
00:53:47.960,00:53:48.840,分流了,00:53:47.960,00:53:48.840,She diverted a lot of votes.
00:53:48.840,00:53:49.040,对,,,
00:53:49.040,00:53:49.960,然后一百万,,,
00:53:49.960,00:53:51.440,他估计说影响选票,00:53:48.840,00:53:52.560,"Yes, an estimate of 1 million votes were diverted."
00:53:51.480,00:53:52.560,影响一百万了,,,
00:53:52.560,00:53:54.800,所以台湾很多国民党的立委,00:53:52.560,00:53:56.600,"Many KMT ""legislators"" would have been elected,
but they lost the election in the end."
00:53:54.800,00:53:55.800,本来是为当选,,,
00:53:55.800,00:53:56.840,最后没有当选,,,
00:53:56.960,00:53:57.680,所以照理讲,00:53:56.960,00:53:58.220,"Theoretically,"
00:53:58.120,00:54:00.880,一个优秀的良好的政治制度,00:53:58.220,00:54:02.200,"a good political system should
consider people's overall interests,"
00:54:00.880,00:54:03.320,它应该考虑人民的整体的,,,
00:54:03.360,00:54:05.800,至少是中长期的利益,00:54:02.480,00:54:05.140,at least the mid-to-long-term interests.
00:54:05.880,00:54:07.200,至少4年的利益,00:54:05.140,00:54:07.680,At least the interests for four years should be guaranteed.
00:54:07.200,00:54:08.640,但你可能这样选举,,,
00:54:08.640,00:54:09.960,往往就一个特定的事件,00:54:07.680,00:54:10.880,"However, one impulsive event can change the election result."
00:54:09.960,00:54:10.880,就全部改变了,,,
00:54:10.880,00:54:12.680,然后这4年你选上人,00:54:10.880,00:54:12.680,"This person takes office for four years,"
00:54:12.680,00:54:14.000,就得没有办法认为,,,
00:54:14.000,00:54:15.480,这就是民主选出来的,00:54:12.680,00:54:15.580,and there is no way to change the decision of your democracy.
00:54:15.880,00:54:18.360,所以这是一个民主制度的悲剧,00:54:15.880,00:54:18.360,"This is a tragedy of the ""democratic system"" -"
00:54:18.360,00:54:19.960,就西方这个模式的悲剧,00:54:18.360,00:54:19.980,the tragedy of the Western model.
00:54:19.960,00:54:21.800,怎么解决这个问题,00:54:19.980,00:54:21.980,How can we solve this problem?
00:54:22.040,00:54:23.200,喂说,00:54:22.040,00:54:24.680,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:54:25.880,00:54:26.440,我们都知道,,,
00:54:26.440,00:54:26.760,政治,,,
00:54:26.760,00:54:28.080,其实是一个非常严肃,00:54:25.880,00:54:29.880,We all know that politics is a very serious and professional subject.
00:54:28.080,00:54:29.960,而且专业的话题和事情,,,
00:54:30.000,00:54:32.160,但是我们在观察台湾的时候,00:54:30.000,00:54:32.160,"When we observe Taiwan,"
00:54:32.160,00:54:34.040,会发现台湾的政治生态,00:54:32.160,00:54:34.320,"we find that Taiwan's political environment,"
00:54:34.520,00:54:35.720,刚才黄女士一直说,00:54:34.420,00:54:36.840,"as Ms. Huang told us, is more like a stage for shows."
00:54:35.760,00:54:36.840,可能像做戏,,,
00:54:36.840,00:54:38.280,他可能也是一种消费,00:54:36.840,00:54:39.520,It is also a kind of consumption and entertainment.
00:54:38.320,00:54:39.520,可能也是一种娱乐,,,
00:54:39.520,00:54:40.160,总而言之,,,
00:54:40.200,00:54:41.160,它偏离了专业,00:54:39.520,00:54:42.280,"All in all, it has deviated from being professional."
00:54:41.160,00:54:42.280,而政治轨道,,,
00:54:42.280,00:54:43.320,这也是西方的,,,
00:54:43.320,00:54:44.760,现在的民主政治,00:54:42.280,00:54:46.080,"This is also the biggest problem of ""democratic politics"" in the West."
00:54:44.800,00:54:46.080,最大的一个问题,,,
00:54:46.080,00:54:46.960,其实说到台湾,,,
00:54:47.040,00:54:48.440,我想我还有一个问题,00:54:46.080,00:54:50.340,"Speaking of Taiwan, I have one more question for you to answer quickly."
00:54:48.440,00:54:50.080,请两位可以快速的回答,,,
00:54:50.480,00:54:52.560,我们知道台湾在很长的一段时间,,,
00:54:52.560,00:54:52.800,里面,,,
00:54:52.800,00:54:53.800,是美国遏制中国,00:54:50.480,00:54:55.660,We know that Taiwan has long been a vital pawn for the United States to constrain China.
00:54:53.840,00:54:55.600,非常重要的一个棋子,,,
00:54:55.600,00:54:58.400,它也是美国封堵中国第一岛链,00:54:55.660,00:54:59.660,It is also their essential part of the first island chain to block China's military forces.
00:54:58.400,00:54:58.680,当中,,,
00:54:58.680,00:55:00.320,非常重要的一环,,,
00:55:00.360,00:55:02.280,所以台湾的整个生态,,,
00:55:02.280,00:55:02.760,跟美国,00:55:00.360,00:55:04.380,"Taiwan's political eco-system
is also inseparable from the US."
00:55:02.760,00:55:04.360,可以说也是密不可分,,,
00:55:04.360,00:55:05.440,所以两位是不是可以,,,
00:55:05.440,00:55:06.760,再深入的从这个角度,,,
00:55:06.800,00:55:08.120,再给我们解释一下,00:55:04.380,00:55:09.200,Can you also talk a bit about this?
00:55:08.120,00:55:09.200,阐述一下,,,
00:55:09.520,00:55:10.160,台湾,,,
00:55:10.960,00:55:12.440,国民党的经历,00:55:09.520,00:55:12.640,The historical genes of the Taiwanese KMT
00:55:12.440,00:55:14.960,就是从美也害怕,00:55:12.640,00:55:15.440,is to respect and fear the US.
00:55:14.960,00:55:15.440,美国,,,
00:55:15.640,00:55:17.280,民进党也是为了台独,00:55:15.640,00:55:18.720,"The DPP  need supports from the US
for ""Taiwan independence""."
00:55:17.280,00:55:19.000,它需要美国的支持,,,
00:55:19.080,00:55:21.400,所以这个都是抱着美国的大腿,00:55:19.080,00:55:21.400,They both hope the US to carry them
00:55:21.400,00:55:25.960,浪费大量台湾的资源和金钱,00:55:21.400,00:55:25.960,and have wasted a lot of resources and money from Taiwan people
00:55:25.960,00:55:27.880,买他那些没有用的武器,00:55:25.960,00:55:28.000,to buy America's useless weapons.
00:55:28.160,00:55:29.920,但是我觉得美国现在有点,00:55:28.160,00:55:30.860,But I think the US has too much to care about right now.
00:55:29.920,00:55:31.040,自顾不暇,,,
00:55:31.080,00:55:34.640,你看这次特朗普从叙利亚撤军,00:55:31.080,00:55:34.640,We all know that Trump withdrew troops from Syria.
00:55:34.760,00:55:36.360,确实是因为美国老百姓,00:55:34.760,00:55:37.720,"Indeed, most American people do not want any more wars."
00:55:36.360,00:55:37.880,多数不想打仗,,,
00:55:37.880,00:55:39.120,打了几十年,,,
00:55:39.160,00:55:40.080,劳命伤财,00:55:37.720,00:55:40.880,It's been decades of wars - it harasses the people and wastes money.
00:55:40.080,00:55:40.840,对不对,,,
00:55:41.000,00:55:45.120,基础设施都非常糟糕,00:55:41.000,00:55:45.120,The infrastructure in the US is getting worse.
00:55:45.280,00:55:46.120,那么,,,
00:55:46.200,00:55:48.600,所以最终美国是要放弃台湾的I,00:55:45.280,00:55:50.380,"As a consequence, the US will give up Taiwan when the critical moment arrives."
00:55:48.600,00:55:50.640,特别到关键的时刻,,,
00:55:50.800,00:55:52.720,这种判断会不会错误的,00:55:50.800,00:55:53.140,This cannot be wrong because
00:55:53.040,00:55:55.720,因为美国出于自己的利益,,,
00:55:56.240,00:55:57.440,台湾在他整个,00:55:53.140,00:56:01.080,Taiwan's position will gradually decline in America's overall strategic thinking
00:55:58.240,00:56:00.000,战略思考中的地位,,,
00:56:00.000,00:56:01.760,I都会逐步的缩小,,,
00:56:01.760,00:56:03.520,所以我这基本的判断,00:56:01.400,00:56:03.520,This is my basic judgment.
00:56:03.720,00:56:05.720,所以国民党也好,,,
00:56:06.080,00:56:07.640,民进党也好,00:56:03.720,00:56:08.740,"Therefore, whether the KMT or the DPP is elected,"
00:56:07.640,00:56:09.040,不管谁当选,,,
00:56:09.040,00:56:09.280,最后,,,
00:56:09.280,00:56:12.080,还是想仅靠一靠美国,,,
00:56:12.120,00:56:13.160,挟洋自重,00:56:09.020,00:56:15.880,"they, more or less, want America to add more weight to their separatist plans."
00:56:13.200,00:56:16.680,来或多或少追求某种台独,,,
00:56:16.680,00:56:18.600,或者是公开走向台独,00:56:16.100,00:56:18.600,"Publicly or under the counter,"
00:56:18.680,00:56:20.880,最后都会彻底失败,00:56:18.680,00:56:20.880,they will both completely fail in the end.
00:56:21.520,00:56:24.160,我觉得香港跟台湾是最重要的,00:56:21.520,00:56:24.160,I think Hong Kong and Taiwan are
00:56:24.160,00:56:25.200,两把匕首,,,
00:56:25.200,00:56:29.000,是美国用来要插进中国的身体的,00:56:24.160,00:56:29.500,the two daggers held by the US to stab into China.
00:56:29.000,00:56:29.640,量保,,,
00:56:30.280,00:56:31.800,香港跟台湾,,,
00:56:31.800,00:56:33.640,这两个的妙用在哪里,00:56:30.280,00:56:33.640,What is the magical use of Hong Kong and Taiwan?
00:56:34.320,00:56:35.760,美国其实不用花钱的,00:56:33.940,00:56:37.460,"That is, the US does not need to spend any money - they can even make some money."
00:56:36.040,00:56:37.120,还倒赚,,,
00:56:37.600,00:56:41.120,用你中国人自己对付中国人最痛,00:56:37.600,00:56:39.600,It is using the Chinese to deal with the Chinese.
,,,00:56:39.600,00:56:41.120,This hurts the most.
00:56:41.320,00:56:43.760,美国接连通过好几个法案,00:56:41.320,00:56:43.660,"The US has passed several bills, one after another."
00:56:43.800,00:56:45.240,都是已经违反,,,
00:56:45.240,00:56:47.000,中美建交三个公报了,00:56:43.660,00:56:46.980,They all have violated the three communiqués on the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations.
00:56:47.000,00:56:48.400,甚至有美国国会议员说,,,
00:56:48.440,00:56:49.640,我们应该要承认,00:56:47.000,00:56:51.100,"Some US members of congress even said that
""It's time that we acknowledge Taiwan as a country."""
00:56:49.680,00:56:51.000,台湾是个国家了,,,
00:56:51.040,00:56:53.000,都已经讲到这个份上了,00:56:51.100,00:56:53.000,They've already gone to far.
00:56:53.240,00:56:55.680,但是它不会真的支持台湾独立,00:56:53.240,00:56:55.680,"But he will not really support Taiwan's ""independence."""
00:56:55.720,00:56:58.960,它就是要弄到大陆受不了,00:56:55.720,00:56:58.960,What they want is to when the mainland cannot tolerate
00:56:59.000,00:56:59.160,好,,,
00:56:59.200,00:57:04.040,然后最好两岸发生小规模的冲突,00:56:59.000,00:57:04.960,"and ideally when small-scale armed conflicts happen,"
00:57:04.080,00:57:04.960,武装冲突,,,
00:57:05.000,00:57:06.760,美国继续卖武器,00:57:05.000,00:57:06.760,so the US can continue to sell weapons.
00:57:07.200,00:57:08.120,火中取栗,,,
00:57:08.160,00:57:09.440,对卖了武器,00:57:07.040,00:57:09.380,"""Picking a chestnut from a fire.""
[gaining little from taking a high risk]"
00:57:09.480,00:57:11.840,然后最后美国又一边卖武器,00:57:09.380,00:57:12.360,"Correct!  In the end, the US sold weapons,"
00:57:11.840,00:57:12.360,卖完以后,,,
00:57:12.360,00:57:13.440,美国就来跟北京讲,,,
00:57:13.440,00:57:13.560,说,,,
00:57:13.560,00:57:14.880,我来调停你们,00:57:12.360,00:57:16.000,and it would tell Beijing that I can help to mediate.
00:57:15.000,00:57:16.280,我来调停你,,,
00:57:16.280,00:57:18.240,所以战争是它引起来的,00:57:16.280,00:57:17.860,"They provoked the war,"
00:57:18.280,00:57:19.000,然后调停,00:57:17.940,00:57:19.640,"and they also guided the mediation,"
00:57:19.000,00:57:21.000,又是他中间卖武器,00:57:19.640,00:57:21.000,"in between, they sold weapons."
00:57:21.040,00:57:23.120,然后又叫美台湾,00:57:21.040,00:57:23.680,America has asked Taiwan to be obedient
00:57:23.200,00:57:23.680,听话,,,
00:57:23.680,00:57:25.080,然后中间美国猪肉,00:57:23.680,00:57:26.080,and forced American pork to enter Taiwan market.
00:57:25.120,00:57:26.080,也要强迫进来,,,
00:57:26.120,00:57:26.400,朝鲜,,,
00:57:26.400,00:57:27.840,你如果不买我美国猪肉,00:57:26.120,00:57:29.200,"""If you don't import my pork, I won't speak for you."""
00:57:27.880,00:57:29.200,我就不帮你台湾讲话,,,
00:57:29.760,00:57:30.000,好,,,
00:57:30.000,00:57:31.760,就整个的逻辑就是这样,00:57:30.000,00:57:31.760,"Okay, this is always their logic."
00:57:31.800,00:57:33.040,所以站在美国的立场,00:57:31.800,00:57:33.580,"From the standpoint of the US,"
00:57:33.040,00:57:36.320,他永远都会抓着台湾傀儡,00:57:33.580,00:57:36.320,"it will always hold Taiwan’s on leash,"
00:57:36.360,00:57:38.280,然后松点经典,00:57:36.360,00:57:38.280,"loose and tight, as it pleases."
00:57:38.280,00:57:39.240,然后他永远会觉得,,,
00:57:39.280,00:57:41.000,台湾是我的痉挛,00:57:38.280,00:57:41.580,Taiwan will be the piece of meat that America exclusively enjoys.
00:57:41.720,00:57:43.440,怎么可以让我知道,,,
00:57:43.480,00:57:44.400,马英九执政的时候,00:57:41.720,00:57:46.120,Ma Ying-jeou hoped to bring Taiwan closer to the mainland during his terms.
00:57:44.440,00:57:46.720,曾经希望台湾跟大陆在更近一点,,,
00:57:46.720,00:57:48.240,但是美国一微克,00:57:46.720,00:57:49.640,"But when US threatened, Ma Ying-jeou immediately backed down."
00:57:48.280,00:57:49.640,马英九立刻后退,,,
00:57:49.640,00:57:52.360,美国不容许他有千百种手段,00:57:49.900,00:57:53.340,The United States has thousands of ways to intimidate
00:57:52.360,00:57:54.720,让执政者在台湾的执政者,,,
00:57:54.720,00:57:56.560,不敢跟大陆统一,00:57:53.340,00:57:56.560,leaders in Taiwan away from reunifying with the mainland.
00:57:57.080,00:57:58.640,是我们都知道,,,
00:57:58.640,00:57:59.400,国际势力,00:57:57.080,00:58:01.120,We all know that some other countries like to play the Taiwan card.
00:57:59.440,00:58:01.400,可能很喜欢打台湾这张牌,,,
00:58:01.440,00:58:02.360,但是总有一天,,,
00:58:02.360,00:58:04.280,这张牌会越来越没有用,00:58:01.440,00:58:04.280,"One day, this card will be weaker and weaker."
00:58:04.280,00:58:04.960,我们也知道,,,
00:58:05.000,00:58:06.040,总书记曾经说过,,,
00:58:06.040,00:58:07.160,台湾问题的产生,00:58:04.280,00:58:09.160,We also know that President Xi said that the Taiwan issue was formed when our nation was weak and poor.
00:58:07.160,00:58:09.960,是在我们民族平弱之时产生的,,,
00:58:09.960,00:58:11.600,但是等到我们的复兴之日,,,
00:58:11.600,00:58:13.840,也就是我们两岸统一之日,00:58:09.960,00:58:13.660,"When we embrace the day of national revival,
 that is the time of our cross-strait reunion."
00:58:13.840,00:58:16.000,所以两位刚才都反复提到这句话,00:58:13.840,00:58:16.000,Both of our guests have repeatedly said
00:58:16.000,00:58:17.680,两岸终将统一,00:58:16.000,00:58:17.680,that the two sides will eventually be reunified.
00:58:17.680,00:58:19.160,所以我们还是期待那一天,00:58:17.680,00:58:19.160,We look forward to that day.
00:58:19.200,00:58:19.880,谢谢两位,,,
00:58:19.880,00:58:20.800,也谢谢我们现场的,00:58:19.200,00:58:21.500,Thank you both. And thanks to our audience today.
00:58:20.840,00:58:21.560,所有观众朋友,,,
00:58:21.560,00:58:22.280,谢谢大家,,,
00:58:22.280,00:58:22.840,再见,00:58:21.560,00:58:23.020,Thank you all. Goodbye.

00:58:24.480,00:58:25.080,没有,,,
00:58:35.680,00:58:38.640,西方经常用言论自由来攻击中国,,,
00:58:38.640,00:58:39.960,那么可以很肯定说,,,
00:58:39.960,00:58:41.840,在日常生活中的言论自由,,,
00:58:42.000,00:58:43.320,中国人要比美国,,,
00:58:43.360,00:58:44.880,比西方多的多,,,
00:58:45.040,00:58:47.200,这一次莫雷他所发表的事情,,,
00:58:47.200,00:58:48.560,更可怕的事情就是,,,
00:58:49.240,00:58:50.320,双重标准,,,
00:58:50.320,00:58:51.840,他们认为中国的媒体,,,
00:58:51.840,00:58:53.480,是受政府管制的,,,
00:58:53.680,00:58:56.200,所以我想问一下老师的观点,,,
00:58:56.240,00:58:59.000,这就是中国听张维为,,,
