00:00:00.760,00:00:02.320,嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯,,,
00:00:02.640,00:00:05.200,阿拉伯之春变成阿拉伯之冬,00:00:02.500,00:00:06.960,"It is now undeniable that the
""Arab Spring"" has turned into ""Arab Winter""."
00:00:05.200,00:00:07.440,今天是一个不争的事实,,,
00:00:07.440,00:00:08.400,埃及的问题,,,
00:00:08.400,00:00:10.640,不是一个民主与专制的问题,00:00:07.700,00:00:10.615,"Egypt's issue is not about democracy or autocracy,"
00:00:10.640,00:00:13.000,而是国家治理好坏的问题,00:00:10.620,00:00:12.740,but whether the country is being misgoverned or not.
00:00:13.240,00:00:14.520,如果我们意识不到,,,
00:00:14.560,00:00:16.160,政治生活的严峻性,00:00:13.040,00:00:16.420,We will be easily influenced by an idealized illusion
00:00:16.160,00:00:17.560,就很容易被一种,,,
00:00:17.560,00:00:19.760,理想化的这种幻想,00:00:16.480,00:00:20.300,if we cannot realize the significance of political life.
00:00:19.800,00:00:21.480,所影响阿拉伯之春,,,
00:00:21.480,00:00:22.680,对欧盟以及欧洲,00:00:20.780,00:00:23.860,"How significant is the impact of the ""Arab Spring""
on the EU and Europe?"
00:00:22.680,00:00:23.960,产生了多大的影响,,,
00:00:24.200,00:00:25.800,这就是中国,,,
00:00:26.120,00:00:27.760,听张维维说,00:00:24.300,00:00:28.240,"China Now with Zhang Weiwei
Translators: The Magpie Bridge Brigade 鹊桥小队翻译组
Twitter/FB/IG @BrigadeMagpie 微信公众号/微博: 鹊桥小队翻译组"
00:00:28.640,00:00:30.360,埃及一直以来,00:00:28.840,00:00:31.820,"For Chinese people, Egypt is most recognized for its tourism."
00:00:30.360,00:00:31.360,对于中国人的印象,,,
00:00:31.360,00:00:33.440,就是旅游在阿拉伯之春闹起来,,,
00:00:33.440,00:00:33.720,以后,00:00:31.825,00:00:35.215,"However, after the ""Arab Spring"","
00:00:33.720,00:00:35.200,一直到后来你会发现,,,
00:00:35.400,00:00:37.200,很多的包括中国大使馆,00:00:35.460,00:00:38.180,"many organizations, including the Chinese Embassy,"
00:00:37.240,00:00:39.640,都向游客不停的发布警告,00:00:38.185,00:00:40.980,"constantly issue warning to Chinese tourists
to prioritise safety."
00:00:39.640,00:00:40.160,说,,,
00:00:40.160,00:00:41.480,如果你去埃及旅游行,,,
00:00:41.480,00:00:42.440,一定注意安全,,,
00:00:42.440,00:00:45.440,很多景点的保障措施是什么,00:00:40.980,00:00:46.940,"At many scenic spots, there are
soldiers carrying loaded weapons to ensure security."
00:00:45.440,00:00:47.160,是拿鹤枪实弹的大病,,,
00:00:47.160,00:00:48.800,当时西方说的,00:00:47.120,00:00:49.960,The western countries promised to bring the light of
00:00:49.280,00:00:51.120,把自由民主之光,,,
00:00:51.120,00:00:52.520,带到了阿拉伯世界的,00:00:49.965,00:00:53.295,freedom and democracy to Arab World.
00:00:52.520,00:00:54.400,第一场大的运动,,,
00:00:54.440,00:00:55.800,结果导致的结果,00:00:53.315,00:00:55.845,"However, their first move resulted in"
00:00:55.840,00:00:56.920,一直到现在为止,,,
00:00:56.920,00:00:58.880,埃及的局势都不是很稳定,00:00:55.845,00:00:58.625,"turbulence in Egypt, even until now."
00:01:00.000,00:01:01.120,他是11年发生了,00:00:58.760,00:01:01.840,"The so-called ""Arab Spring"" happened in 2011."
00:01:01.360,00:01:02.440,所谓的阿拉伯之春,,,
00:01:02.480,00:01:03.800,我12 13年的时候,,,
00:01:03.800,00:01:05.440,正好认识了一位埃及的记者,00:01:02.020,00:01:06.600,"I was acquainted to an
Egyptian reporter in 2012 or 2013."
00:01:05.440,00:01:06.560,是一位男记者,,,
00:01:06.600,00:01:07.920,当时我们也问他,,,
00:01:07.920,00:01:08.600,就是在埃及,,,
00:01:08.600,00:01:09.640,现在是个什么情况,00:01:06.800,00:01:10.755,"We asked him about the situtation in Egypt
one or two years after the ""Arab Spring""."
00:01:09.640,00:01:11.400,因为你当时已经过去一两年了,,,
00:01:11.400,00:01:13.400,然后他就非常惋惜地说,00:01:10.755,00:01:13.995,"He was pitiful saying that Egypt used to be very safe,"
00:01:13.400,00:01:15.880,之前像你们中国游客来的时候,00:01:13.995,00:01:16.595,"especially in Cairo, the capital city,"
00:01:15.920,00:01:16.080,说,,,
00:01:16.120,00:01:17.160,埃及是非常安全的,,,
00:01:17.200,00:01:18.560,有几个首都开罗说,00:01:16.595,00:01:18.795,when Chinese tourists visited.
00:01:18.600,00:01:19.880,现在你如果一个女性,,,
00:01:19.920,00:01:21.280,在开罗街头走的话,00:01:18.795,00:01:21.235,"But now, you are very likely to face various levels of harassment"
00:01:21.280,00:01:22.880,你十有八九一定会碰到,,,
00:01:22.920,00:01:26.200,对你进行各种从大到小各种骚扰,00:01:21.240,00:01:27.040,"if you are a woman walking on the street in Cairo,
which is not safe at all."
00:01:26.200,00:01:27.400,其实是非常不安全的,,,
00:01:27.440,00:01:28.600,这是一个埃及记者,00:01:27.220,00:01:29.960,This is the observation by an Egyptian reporter.
00:01:28.600,00:01:30.160,他给出的一个观察,,,
00:01:30.200,00:01:32.040,所以问题就是可能一开始,00:01:30.320,00:01:32.520,So the issue is:
00:01:32.040,00:01:35.560,大家怀有一种美好的渴望和想象,00:01:32.525,00:01:35.475,why did the hope and aspiration the people held
00:01:35.560,00:01:37.840,但是为什么最后会演变成了目前,00:01:35.480,00:01:39.800,turn into the situation described by you two?
00:01:37.840,00:01:39.680,两位说到的这样的一种状况,,,
00:01:40.040,00:01:42.280,背后一定有非常复杂的原因,00:01:39.800,00:01:42.400,There must be a complicated reason behind it.
00:01:42.280,00:01:43.920,我觉得赵老师可以帮我们,,,
00:01:43.960,00:01:46.240,把背后的原因分析清楚,00:01:42.420,00:01:46.620,I think Professor Zhang could help us analyze the reasons.
00:01:47.160,00:01:48.520,我们大概也知道一些,00:01:46.880,00:01:49.440,We roughly know what they are.
00:01:48.520,00:01:51.440,比如说他们所渴求的药方,00:01:49.445,00:01:52.215,"For example, the cure they craved for."
00:01:51.440,00:01:54.000,就是西方输送的一揽子的方案,00:01:52.220,00:01:54.760,was a packaged solution imported from the west:
00:01:54.200,00:01:54.680,政治,,,
00:01:54.680,00:01:55.840,赶紧搞多党制,,,
00:01:55.840,00:01:56.320,赶紧搞,00:01:54.840,00:01:57.960,"politics - implementing a multi-party system,
and an electoral system right away."
00:01:57.040,00:01:58.000,选举制,,,
00:01:58.280,00:02:00.040,这些是不是好的药方,00:01:57.960,00:02:00.020,Are these good solutions ?
00:02:00.040,00:02:02.120,现在真的已经8年过去了,00:02:00.020,00:02:03.820,"More than eight years has passed,"
00:02:02.160,00:02:03.400,8年了,,,
00:02:03.400,00:02:05.120,甚至是我们从当地区,,,
00:02:05.120,00:02:06.040,不只是埃及,00:02:03.825,00:02:06.895,"The situations of many countries and regions,
not just Egypt,"
00:02:06.040,00:02:06.880,像利比亚,,,
00:02:06.880,00:02:07.480,也门等等,,,
00:02:07.480,00:02:08.120,很多国家,00:02:06.895,00:02:08.795,"like Libya, Yemen, Tunisia and so forth,"
00:02:08.120,00:02:08.960,突尼斯,,,
00:02:08.960,00:02:11.320,他们甚至可能都不及之前,00:02:08.800,00:02:11.360,are even worse than
00:02:11.320,00:02:13.400,就是整个受国家社会的情况,,,
00:02:13.400,00:02:15.520,甚至都不及发生所谓颜色更名,00:02:11.440,00:02:16.560,before the color revolutions took place.
00:02:15.520,00:02:16.040,之前,,,
00:02:16.080,00:02:17.480,我们现在只看到破,00:02:16.600,00:02:18.620,"Now we only see the destruction, not the construction."
00:02:17.480,00:02:19.560,没有看到利利在哪里,00:02:18.700,00:02:20.000,Where's the construction?
00:02:19.840,00:02:21.560,这是西方需要回答的问题,00:02:20.160,00:02:22.020,The western countries need to provide an answer
00:02:21.560,00:02:23.640,这是他们之前煽动,00:02:22.040,00:02:25.220,"as they instigated and overturned
so many governments."
00:02:23.640,00:02:25.280,颠覆那么多国家的政府,,,
00:02:25.280,00:02:26.760,现在哪一个国家,00:02:25.300,00:02:28.180,Was there any country which improved a lot
00:02:27.160,00:02:27.960,说重建之后,,,
00:02:27.960,00:02:29.280,比以前好了很多,,,
00:02:29.320,00:02:30.640,实现了西方许诺的,00:02:28.220,00:02:32.200,"and reached the ""perfect world on
the other shore"" as promised?"
00:02:30.640,00:02:32.720,这样一个美好的彼岸世界了,,,
00:02:32.880,00:02:33.920,恐怕是没有了,00:02:32.880,00:02:33.980,Probably none.
00:02:33.960,00:02:34.920,而且最重要的是,,,
00:02:34.920,00:02:37.040,其实这个破了之后的这些后果,00:02:34.040,00:02:36.755,"More importantly, after their
governments were overturned,"
00:02:37.040,00:02:39.520,全部都是当地的老百姓在承受,00:02:36.755,00:02:39.325,"it was the people who were
bearing the consequences."
00:02:39.600,00:02:41.160,这个是最要命的问题,00:02:39.325,00:02:40.920,This is a critical issue.
00:02:41.360,00:02:42.720,埃及的经济,,,
00:02:42.760,00:02:44.000,原来在非洲,,,
00:02:44.000,00:02:44.760,整个北非,00:02:41.380,00:02:46.980,"Egypt's economy was doing alright
among Northern African countries."
00:02:44.760,00:02:46.640,算是能够拿得出手的,,,
00:02:46.640,00:02:49.120,但是从穆巴拉克一直到现在,00:02:47.100,00:02:49.920,"However, since Hosni Mubarak stepped down,"
00:02:49.120,00:02:50.520,整个的经济的变化,,,
00:02:50.520,00:02:51.200,你会发现,,,
00:02:51.240,00:02:52.400,它越来越越低,00:02:49.980,00:02:53.240,the economy is worsening.
00:02:52.400,00:02:53.080,越来越低,,,
00:02:53.400,00:02:55.640,个人的呃观察和采访的经验,00:02:53.320,00:02:55.820,"Based on my personal observation
and interviewing experience,"
00:02:55.640,00:02:57.880,我觉得比如我在西藏,,,
00:02:57.880,00:02:59.880,有长达7个月,00:02:55.820,00:03:02.020,"for example, I lived in Tibet for seven months,
filming a documentary."
00:03:00.000,00:03:01.960,拍摄纪录片采访的经历,,,
00:03:01.960,00:03:03.960,那么观察西藏,00:03:02.080,00:03:03.800,I found Tibet has its own
00:03:03.960,00:03:07.160,包括一些自然环境独特也包,,,
00:03:07.160,00:03:09.480,包含有自己的民族文化,00:03:03.800,00:03:10.920,"unique natural environment, and ethnic culture."
00:03:09.480,00:03:11.840,这么一个经济层面,,,
00:03:11.840,00:03:14.200,相对后发的这些地区,00:03:10.940,00:03:14.295,"For regions which are struggling economically,"
00:03:14.240,00:03:15.920,我觉得中央政府的制度安排,00:03:14.300,00:03:17.120,"I believe having policies from the central
government is of vital importance."
00:03:15.920,00:03:16.880,是非常重要的,,,
00:03:17.200,00:03:18.680,很多经济的举措,,,
00:03:18.680,00:03:20.480,包括一些制度性的改革,00:03:17.120,00:03:20.700,"Many economic policies and systematic
reform, should consider"
00:03:20.480,00:03:22.640,还是要有一个度的问题,,,
00:03:22.720,00:03:23.240,力度,00:03:20.700,00:03:25.600,"how moderate they are, how quickly they are
implemented, as well as their scope and depth."
00:03:23.240,00:03:23.880,速度,,,
00:03:23.880,00:03:25.720,包括广度和深度,,,
00:03:25.720,00:03:27.160,如果操之过急,,,
00:03:27.160,00:03:29.000,如果是从天而降,00:03:25.900,00:03:28.620,"If they are implemented in a haste, or if they
came out of nowhere,"
00:03:29.000,00:03:31.080,强加于这个地区,00:03:28.620,00:03:31.100,"or forced to be adopted,"
00:03:31.080,00:03:34.320,很有可能会造成新的灾难和动乱,00:03:31.200,00:03:34.180,new disasters and unrest are likely to occur.
00:03:34.320,00:03:36.120,所以我还是希望张教授,,,
00:03:36.160,00:03:37.280,能够跟我们的观众,00:03:34.185,00:03:38.960,"So I hope that Professor Zhang can elaborate on this
to our audience."
00:03:37.280,00:03:39.880,能够讲明白你的想法,,,
00:03:39.880,00:03:41.760,你有你的一揽子计划,00:03:39.040,00:03:43.360,Is one regions' package solution suitable for another?
00:03:41.800,00:03:43.360,那么这个地方合不合适,,,
00:03:43.560,00:03:46.040,对这个地方是好药,,,
00:03:46.040,00:03:49.520,还是会带来巨大副作用的劣药,00:03:43.840,00:03:49.460,"Is it good medicine or bad drugs with
tremendous side effects?"
00:03:50.120,00:03:52.680,我觉得很多政治家值得考虑,00:03:49.640,00:03:52.515,"For many politicians, this question is worth considering."
00:03:52.720,00:03:54.360,就什么样的一种治理方式,00:03:52.515,00:03:54.855,What kind of governance is suitable for
00:03:54.360,00:03:56.320,是适合这个地方的文化,00:03:54.860,00:03:57.480,the culture and history of this place?
00:03:56.320,00:03:57.720,适合这个地方的历史,,,
00:03:57.760,00:03:59.320,就中国人一直说叫实事求是,00:03:57.480,00:04:00.460,"Chinese people always say: ""seek truth from the facts""  and ""adapt to local conditions."""
00:03:59.320,00:04:00.240,因地制宜,,,
00:04:00.240,00:04:01.200,就这几个字,,,
00:04:01.200,00:04:02.000,水土要服,00:04:00.520,00:04:02.900,"And ""acclimatize to the local water and soil"""
00:04:02.000,00:04:03.560,就这几点特别重要,,,
00:04:03.560,00:04:05.200,我们可能遇到一些经济的难题,00:04:02.900,00:04:06.960,"These points are significant. We may run into some
economic difficulties, or some other issues,"
00:04:05.360,00:04:06.800,可能遇到一些其他的难题,,,
00:04:06.840,00:04:08.840,然后你到底选择什么样的药方,00:04:06.960,00:04:10.045,and it's vital what prescription you choose
00:04:08.840,00:04:10.240,选择用什么样的方式,,,
00:04:10.240,00:04:11.720,去解决这些问题,00:04:10.045,00:04:12.415,to solve the problem.
00:04:11.720,00:04:14.200,是非常考验政府政党,,,
00:04:14.240,00:04:16.720,它的一个综合治理能力的,00:04:12.420,00:04:16.680,"It tests a government on its
overall governance capacities"
00:04:16.760,00:04:18.400,我觉得从阿拉伯之春,,,
00:04:18.440,00:04:20.280,阿拉伯之中这样的一种变化,00:04:16.940,00:04:21.720,"I think this point can absolutely be drawn from the transition from the ""Arab Spring"" to the ""Arab Winter""."
00:04:20.280,00:04:21.920,完全可以树立这一点,,,
00:04:26.280,00:04:26.840,大家好,,,
00:04:26.880,00:04:27.400,欢迎来到,00:04:26.300,00:04:28.340,"Hello everyone,

00:04:28.160,00:04:29.800,让我们一起在这里定位中国,,,
00:04:29.800,00:04:30.440,读懂中国,00:04:28.340,00:04:31.420,"We are here to position China, learn about China, and understand China."
00:04:30.440,00:04:31.640,也理解中国,,,
00:04:31.680,00:04:32.920,今天场上两位嘉宾,00:04:31.420,00:04:33.380,"Standing next to me are our two guests,"

00:04:34.320,00:04:36.120,复旦大学中国研究院的院长,00:04:33.380,00:04:37.660,"our keynote speaker, Prof. Zhang Weiwei, Director of

00:04:37.080,00:04:37.760,欢迎,,,
00:04:37.880,00:04:39.200,还有一位是复旦大学,,,

of the China Institute of Fudan University."
00:04:40.560,00:04:41.800,范永鹏教授,,,
00:04:41.800,00:04:43.200,欢迎那两位嘉宾,,,
00:04:43.320,00:04:45.040,会跟我们一起来展开对话,00:04:42.440,00:04:44.960,Our two guests will hold a discussion with us.
00:04:45.040,00:04:46.200,在对话开始前,,,
00:04:46.200,00:04:47.640,我们还是要先来聆听,00:04:44.960,00:04:49.020,"But let's first listen to the keynote speech
from Professor Zhang."
00:04:47.640,00:04:49.000,张教授的主题演讲,00:04:49.020,00:04:50.340,Welcome!
00:04:55.560,00:04:58.560,阿拉伯之春变成阿拉伯之冬,00:04:55.520,00:05:00.160,"It is now undeniable that the ""Arab Spring""
has become ""Arab Winter""."
00:04:58.560,00:05:00.560,今天是一个不争的事实,,,
00:05:00.920,00:05:02.080,但我们要了解,,,
00:05:02.080,00:05:04.360,为什么会出现这种变化,00:05:00.760,00:05:04.160,"We need to understand the reason of the change,"
00:05:04.600,00:05:06.040,这对于我们中国人,,,
00:05:06.040,00:05:07.960,确立自己的道路自信,00:05:04.360,00:05:08.840,"because it's crucial for us to establish
confidence in our own political path."
00:05:08.040,00:05:09.000,非常重要,,,
00:05:09.840,00:05:10.560,大家知道,,,
00:05:10.560,00:05:11.640,就是阿拉伯之春,00:05:09.820,00:05:12.880,"You all probably know that the ""Arab Spring"" began"
00:05:11.920,00:05:14.160,始于2010年底,,,
00:05:14.160,00:05:16.480,就突尼斯的一个小贩的自焚的,00:05:12.880,00:05:16.800,"with a vendor burning himself in Tunisia
towards the end of 2010."
00:05:16.480,00:05:17.040,事件,,,
00:05:17.520,00:05:20.640,引起了当时突尼斯民众对失业,00:05:17.420,00:05:20.520,"It sparked dissatisfactions among
the Tunisian people"
00:05:20.760,00:05:21.880,就物价上涨,,,
00:05:22.080,00:05:23.640,对腐败等等的不满,00:05:20.525,00:05:23.475,"about unemployment, inflation, and corruption,"
00:05:23.640,00:05:25.360,然后最后引起了骚乱,00:05:23.475,00:05:25.365,which further led to the unrest.
00:05:25.920,00:05:28.400,那么但突尼斯毕竟是一个人口,00:05:25.740,00:05:28.180,"However, Tunisia is just a small country"
00:05:28.400,00:05:29.800,只有千万的小国,00:05:28.180,00:05:30.040,with a population of tens of millions.
00:05:29.960,00:05:30.680,阿拉伯之春,,,
00:05:30.680,00:05:32.040,很快就蔓延到了,00:05:30.040,00:05:33.580,"The “Arab Spring” quickly spread to a big Middle Eastern country, Egypt,"
00:05:32.080,00:05:33.240,人口经济的,,,
00:05:33.240,00:05:34.960,埃及中东大国,00:05:33.580,00:05:35.420,with a population of nearly a hundred million.
00:05:35.680,00:05:36.600,一下子大家就感到,,,
00:05:36.600,00:05:38.720,事态变得非常严重了,00:05:35.425,00:05:38.505,Suddenly everyone felt the severity of the situation.
00:05:38.800,00:05:40.120,随后阿拉伯之春,,,
00:05:40.160,00:05:42.200,又扩展到西亚北非,00:05:38.640,00:05:42.940,"Then ""Arab Spring"" expanded to many countries in Western Asia, and Northern Africa."
00:05:42.280,00:05:43.200,很多国家,,,
00:05:43.600,00:05:45.840,当时西方国家一片欢呼声,00:05:43.260,00:05:46.520,"Back then, western countries cheered,"
00:05:45.920,00:05:48.320,一个新的中东即将诞生,00:05:46.520,00:05:48.860,claiming a new Middle East would be born.
00:05:48.800,00:05:50.160,但8年过去了,,,
00:05:50.280,00:05:52.400,利比亚已经四分五裂,00:05:48.940,00:05:51.960,"However, eight years later,
Libya has broken apart"
00:05:52.400,00:05:55.440,整个国家陷入无政府的内战状态,00:05:52.160,00:05:55.340,and the whole country fell into anarchy and civil war.
00:05:55.720,00:05:58.440,连美国大使也被民众杀死,00:05:55.560,00:05:58.380,Even the American ambassador was killed.
00:05:58.920,00:06:00.480,突尼斯虽然没有解体,,,
00:06:00.480,00:06:02.760,但国家经济受到重创,00:05:58.680,00:06:02.640,Tunisia did not disintegrate but its economy has been hit hard.
00:06:03.080,00:06:05.640,原来的世俗政权日益伊斯兰化,00:06:02.640,00:06:05.840,"The original secular regime has become an
increasingly Islamic one."
00:06:06.240,00:06:08.040,也门更是动荡不止,00:06:05.980,00:06:07.980,Yemen is also in turmoil.
00:06:08.120,00:06:10.600,一个人口数量少于上海的国家,00:06:08.000,00:06:12.320,"The country with a population of 23 million,
less than that of Shanghai,"
00:06:10.600,00:06:12.120,它是2300万人,,,
00:06:12.440,00:06:14.440,同时经历了三场战争,00:06:12.320,00:06:14.520,"is having three wars simultaneously,"
00:06:14.440,00:06:15.680,部落间的战争,,,
00:06:15.720,00:06:17.160,教派间的战争,00:06:14.520,00:06:16.935,"a war among tribes, a war among sects,"
00:06:17.160,00:06:19.440,政府军与基地组织的战争,00:06:16.935,00:06:19.895,"and a war between the government army and Al-Qaeda,"
00:06:19.480,00:06:22.200,很可能还有也南部也门要求独立,00:06:19.900,00:06:22.920,"Maybe, southern Yemen will also start a
war demanding independence."
00:06:22.200,00:06:22.880,的战争,,,
00:06:23.560,00:06:24.360,那么叙利亚,,,
00:06:24.360,00:06:24.960,更是有一个,,,
00:06:25.000,00:06:26.560,初步繁荣的国家,00:06:23.320,00:06:28.380,"Furthermore Syria, which enjoyed relative prosperity,
turned into a hell on earth."
00:06:26.560,00:06:28.440,变成人间地狱,,,
00:06:28.880,00:06:30.920,所以埃及现任总统塞西,00:06:28.680,00:06:31.760,"The current Egyptian President Al-Sisi said,"
00:06:31.040,00:06:32.240,他这样讲过,,,
00:06:32.240,00:06:34.120,叙利亚伊拉克,,,
00:06:34.160,00:06:37.320,利比亚和也门等国发生的事件,00:06:31.760,00:06:36.860,"what happened in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen"
00:06:37.600,00:06:39.480,给这些国家的生命财产,00:06:37.580,00:06:41.240,caused huge losses to life and property.
00:06:39.480,00:06:41.160,造成巨大损失,,,
00:06:41.400,00:06:44.880,基础设施损失达9000亿美元,00:06:41.240,00:06:44.600,"Damage to infrastructure reached up to
900 billion dollars."
00:06:45.040,00:06:47.680,死亡人数超过140万,00:06:45.100,00:06:50.200,"The death toll exceeded 1.4 million, and 150 million
people became refugees."
00:06:47.840,00:06:50.400,沦为难民的有1500多万人,,,
00:06:51.040,00:06:52.520,这就是我讲的作孽,00:06:50.820,00:06:52.980,This is what I refer to as a sin.
00:06:53.800,00:06:55.800,那么我去过突尼斯,,,
00:06:55.800,00:06:56.600,叙利亚,00:06:53.540,00:06:58.840,"I have been to these Middle Eastern countries,
like Tunisia, and Syria,"
00:06:56.760,00:06:59.040,等这些中东国家,,,
00:06:59.160,00:07:00.960,但是这些国家我只去过一次,00:06:59.120,00:07:00.940,but I have only been there once.
00:07:01.280,00:07:02.680,埃及我去过,,,
00:07:02.680,00:07:04.240,应该说6~7次,00:07:01.360,00:07:04.560,"However, I have been to Egypt 6 or 7 times."
00:07:04.920,00:07:08.520,所以我这里可以为大家解剖一下,00:07:04.920,00:07:06.860,So I can expand on
00:07:08.560,00:07:11.120,埃及之春麻雀和埃及之春,00:07:07.120,00:07:12.060,"how the ""Arab Spring"" transitioned to an ""Arab Winter""."
00:07:11.120,00:07:12.520,怎么变成埃及之冬,,,
00:07:13.000,00:07:15.520,那么2011年1月的时候呢,00:07:13.100,00:07:15.160,"In January 2011,"
00:07:15.880,00:07:19.040,出现了声势浩大的反政府的浪潮,00:07:15.760,00:07:20.420,"a massive wave of anti-government protest
emerged in Cairo, Egypt."
00:07:19.080,00:07:19.960,在开罗,,,
00:07:19.960,00:07:20.920,在埃及,,,
00:07:21.400,00:07:23.840,到2月11号的时候,00:07:21.140,00:07:26.300,"In February 11, the long-term Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak stepped down."
00:07:23.840,00:07:26.320,长期执政的穆巴拉克总统下台了,,,
00:07:26.440,00:07:28.160,当时西方媒体非常激动,00:07:26.460,00:07:29.280,"Back then, the western media were very excited,"
00:07:28.280,00:07:29.960,认为伟大的西方民主模式,,,
00:07:30.000,00:07:31.880,终于降临到了阿拉伯世界,00:07:29.280,00:07:32.880,"claiming the great western democracy finally arrived in the Arab world, in Egypt."
00:07:31.920,00:07:32.920,降临到了埃及,,,
00:07:33.840,00:07:34.920,那么我对埃及,,,
00:07:34.920,00:07:35.720,对中东地区,00:07:33.540,00:07:37.860,"I have conducted many investigations
in the Middle East and Egypt."
00:07:35.720,00:07:37.080,做过许多实地的考察,,,
00:07:37.080,00:07:38.680,我在埃及普通老百姓家里,,,
00:07:38.680,00:07:39.960,我都住过,00:07:37.860,00:07:39.980,I also lived together with ordinary Egyptian people.
00:07:40.160,00:07:41.280,所以我对那个地区的,,,
00:07:41.280,00:07:42.040,真实情况,00:07:40.080,00:07:42.880,So I know the situation quite well.
00:07:42.040,00:07:43.040,比较了解,,,
00:07:43.360,00:07:44.120,所以8年前,,,
00:07:44.120,00:07:45.120,我和福山辩论时,00:07:43.220,00:07:45.500,"Eight years ago, when I debated with Francis Fukuyama,"
00:07:45.120,00:07:46.800,我就比较准确的预测了,,,
00:07:46.800,00:07:47.880,阿拉伯之春,00:07:45.500,00:07:49.340,"I accurately predicted that the ""Arab Spring""
would turn into an ""Arab Winter""."
00:07:48.120,00:07:49.720,将变大了不知东,,,
00:07:50.200,00:07:51.840,那么中国人讲知行合一,00:07:50.000,00:07:52.405,"The Chinese people emphasize
""the unity between perception and action"""
00:07:51.840,00:07:53.840,讲读万卷书行万里路,00:07:52.405,00:07:54.400,"We also say ""Read ten thousand books and
walk ten thousand miles""."
00:07:54.080,00:07:55.480,邓小平也讲过一句话,00:07:54.400,00:07:55.900,"Deng Xiaoping, once said,"
00:07:55.520,00:07:57.400,叫一个听过枪声的士兵,,,
00:07:57.480,00:07:59.000,和没有听过枪声的视频,00:07:55.900,00:08:00.160,"""A soldier who has heard gunfire is completely different
from to the one who has not."""
00:07:59.000,00:08:00.360,是完全不一样的,,,
00:08:00.960,00:08:02.720,所以实地考察过一个地方,,,
00:08:02.720,00:08:03.880,和没有考察过,00:08:00.740,00:08:05.040,"To be there and investigate makes a difference
than when one does not."
00:08:03.880,00:08:05.080,也是不一样的,,,
00:08:05.320,00:08:05.920,做学问,,,
00:08:05.920,00:08:06.840,特别是政治学,00:08:05.440,00:08:08.100,"I believe that doing research,
especially political science,"
00:08:06.840,00:08:08.880,我觉得对政治要有感觉,,,
00:08:08.880,00:08:10.000,要接地气,00:08:08.100,00:08:11.840,"should have a sense of politics, and be hands-on,
otherwise you cannot understand"
00:08:10.000,00:08:11.720,否则既读不懂中国政治,,,
00:08:11.720,00:08:13.760,也读不懂世界政治,00:08:11.840,00:08:13.860,neither China's nor the world's politics.
00:08:14.400,00:08:15.760,我曾经在埃及境内,00:08:14.460,00:08:17.100,"In Egypt, I once flew from North to South,"
00:08:15.840,00:08:18.640,从北往南一路坐飞机,00:08:17.105,00:08:19.725,from the capital Cairo to Aswan
00:08:18.680,00:08:21.120,从首都开罗沿着尼罗河,,,
00:08:21.160,00:08:22.480,往南到阿斯旺,00:08:19.725,00:08:22.605,along the Nile River.
00:08:23.040,00:08:24.440,那么放眼望去,00:08:22.800,00:08:24.700,"Looking around,"
00:08:24.840,00:08:27.920,尼罗河两岸一个狭长的绿洲之外,00:08:24.880,00:08:27.900,"on both sides of the Nile River, beyond a long and narrow oasis,"
00:08:27.920,00:08:29.960,就全是一望无际的沙漠,00:08:28.020,00:08:30.400,there is an endless desert.
00:08:30.400,00:08:31.640,这时你会感到,,,
00:08:31.640,00:08:33.200,就这个尼罗河,00:08:30.560,00:08:34.580,"At that point, you realize the value of Nile River"
00:08:33.200,00:08:35.760,对于埃及生存的重要意义,,,
00:08:35.920,00:08:38.040,尼罗河是埃及的生命线,00:08:34.580,00:08:38.180,for the existence of Egypt: it is Egypt's lifeline.
00:08:38.600,00:08:41.440,就埃及的自然环境非常恶劣,00:08:38.600,00:08:41.455,Egypt’s natural environment is very harsh:
00:08:41.440,00:08:42.600,埃及的国土面积,,,
00:08:42.640,00:08:44.360,大约是100多万平方公里,00:08:41.460,00:08:44.560,"the country is around one million
square kilometers in size,"
00:08:44.640,00:08:45.480,但整个国家,,,
00:08:45.480,00:08:47.760,95%的领土都是沙漠,00:08:44.560,00:08:47.780,with 95% of it being desert.
00:08:48.240,00:08:49.880,当时11年的时候,,,
00:08:49.920,00:08:52.160,他的人口已经将近9000多万,00:08:48.020,00:08:52.440,"In 2011, its population was nearly 90 million,"
00:08:52.160,00:08:55.560,但都蜗居在5%的国土上,00:08:52.440,00:08:55.340,but they all lived on 5% of its territory.
00:08:55.960,00:08:57.320,所以埃及的人均资源,,,
00:08:57.320,00:08:58.520,是非常有限的,00:08:56.080,00:08:58.900,"Therefore, the resources per capita were extremely limited."
00:08:59.320,00:09:00.200,但尽管这样,,,
00:09:00.200,00:09:01.840,埃及人口增长非常快,00:08:59.240,00:09:02.320,"Nevertheless, its population
increased rapidly and was very young,"
00:09:01.880,00:09:02.920,也非常年轻,,,
00:09:02.920,00:09:04.000,50%的人口,00:09:02.320,00:09:05.080,as 50% were less than 25 years old.
00:09:04.040,00:09:05.040,不到25岁,,,
00:09:05.880,00:09:08.000,然后就没有整个像样的制造业,00:09:05.685,00:09:07.835,But there was no decent manufacturing industry.
00:09:08.600,00:09:09.200,这意味着,,,
00:09:09.200,00:09:11.400,就青年的失业率非常高,00:09:08.380,00:09:13.180,"This meant high unemployment rate
among youngsters - greater than 30%."
00:09:11.840,00:09:13.400,当时超过了30%,,,
00:09:14.040,00:09:16.520,那么在埃及的大街小巷,00:09:13.880,00:09:18.460,There were idle young people everywhere in the Egyptian streets.
00:09:16.560,00:09:19.000,到处都是无所事事的年轻人,,,
00:09:19.160,00:09:21.160,让你去阿拉伯之声的国家,,,
00:09:21.200,00:09:22.280,突尼斯也好,00:09:19.140,00:09:23.620,"If you go to countries which have gone through the
""Arab Spring"",  like Tunisia, Syria, and Algeria,"
00:09:22.280,00:09:23.280,叙利亚也好,,,
00:09:23.280,00:09:24.320,阿尔及利亚也好,,,
00:09:24.320,00:09:26.000,情况大致是类似的,00:09:23.620,00:09:26.100,you will find the situations are alike.
00:09:26.520,00:09:27.400,失业的人,,,
00:09:27.400,00:09:28.480,无业的年轻人,00:09:26.380,00:09:28.720,Unemployed young people
00:09:28.480,00:09:31.040,成了后来所谓阿拉伯之春的主要,00:09:28.720,00:09:32.020,"became the main participants of the ""Arab Spring""."
00:09:31.040,00:09:31.960,参与者,,,
00:09:32.920,00:09:34.160,那么到2008年,00:09:32.640,00:09:35.660,"In 2008 when the Financial Crisis broke out,"
00:09:34.160,00:09:35.840,美国金融危机爆发后,,,
00:09:35.960,00:09:38.960,美国大搞货币量化宽松,00:09:35.660,00:09:40.920,"the U.S. heavily engaged in quantitative easing.
In reality, they were transferring the danger."
00:09:39.000,00:09:40.920,实际上就是转嫁危机,,,
00:09:41.400,00:09:42.560,导致了很多国家,,,
00:09:42.560,00:09:44.040,包括埃及在内的,00:09:41.160,00:09:44.055,This led to an overall increase in prices
00:09:44.040,00:09:45.240,整个中东地区的,,,
00:09:45.240,00:09:46.840,物价的全面上涨,00:09:44.055,00:09:46.855,"in the Middle East, including Egypt."
00:09:47.400,00:09:50.000,埃及的货币A棒迅速贬值,00:09:47.180,00:09:50.280,"The Egyptian currency, the Egyptian Pound,
depreciated quickly."
00:09:50.760,00:09:53.320,在埃及民众餐桌上的主食,00:09:50.580,00:09:53.500,"The prices of staple foods for Egyptian people,"
00:09:53.320,00:09:54.240,比方说面包,,,
00:09:54.440,00:09:55.160,西红柿,00:09:53.505,00:09:56.465,"such as bread, tomato, beef and mutton,"
00:09:55.840,00:09:57.960,牛羊肉啊价格都成倍的增长,00:09:56.465,00:09:57.800,multiplied.
00:09:58.400,00:09:59.160,我在埃及的时候,00:09:58.160,00:09:59.600,"When I was in Egypt,"
00:09:59.160,00:10:00.760,我的学生曾经陪我去开罗,,,
00:10:00.760,00:10:02.080,农贸市场调研,00:09:59.600,00:10:02.460,"my students accompanied me for a field trips
at produce markets in Cairo."
00:10:02.280,00:10:03.400,一公斤的西红柿,,,
00:10:03.400,00:10:04.920,半年内涨价6倍,00:10:02.540,00:10:05.420,"The price of one kilogram of tomatoes increased
six-fold within half a year,"
00:10:05.640,00:10:08.640,从2个爱棒一公斤到12个爱棒,00:10:05.720,00:10:08.580,"from 2 Egyptian pounds to 12 Egyptian pounds,"
00:10:08.640,00:10:09.120,一公斤,,,
00:10:09.120,00:10:11.200,当时大概等于你是2美元,00:10:08.640,00:10:11.620,which is around 2 dollars for one kilogram.
00:10:11.200,00:10:12.040,公斤,,,
00:10:12.280,00:10:13.760,那么当时埃及人口中,,,
00:10:13.760,00:10:14.800,40%的,00:10:12.000,00:10:16.500,"Back then, 40% of the Egyptian people
earned less than 2 dollars a day."
00:10:14.800,00:10:15.600,每天的收入,,,
00:10:15.600,00:10:16.600,不到两美元,,,
00:10:16.760,00:10:18.800,所以这生活是非常艰难的,00:10:16.500,00:10:18.480,Life was really hard.
00:10:19.520,00:10:21.160,那么这些的背后,,,
00:10:21.240,00:10:22.720,是埃及的经济结构,00:10:19.260,00:10:23.600,This is all because of its unhealthy economic structure.
00:10:22.720,00:10:24.120,是非常畸形的,,,
00:10:24.680,00:10:25.960,一种畸形的结构,00:10:24.460,00:10:26.120,It was misformed.
00:10:26.160,00:10:28.880,那么埃及整体上还相当贫困,00:10:26.240,00:10:29.100,"Overall, Egypt is impoverished,"
00:10:29.240,00:10:31.320,但是贫富差距已经非常大,00:10:29.260,00:10:31.500,with a huge gap between the rich and the poor.
00:10:31.840,00:10:35.240,国家经济已经大量的依赖进口,00:10:32.060,00:10:34.600,The national economy heavily depends on
00:10:35.240,00:10:36.040,消费品,00:10:34.600,00:10:37.340,"imported consumer goods,"
00:10:36.320,00:10:38.760,结果埃及变得债台高筑,00:10:37.340,00:10:39.420,resulting in colossal national debts.
00:10:39.240,00:10:40.640,那么我第一次访问埃及,,,
00:10:40.640,00:10:41.760,是1986年,00:10:39.420,00:10:42.920,I followed our former president Li Xiannian
00:10:41.760,00:10:44.120,当时我是属于我们国家的,,,
00:10:44.120,00:10:46.080,时任的国家主席李先念,00:10:42.920,00:10:46.180,when I first visited Egypt in 1986.
00:10:47.040,00:10:48.840,当时双方会谈的一个重要的问题,00:10:46.800,00:10:49.820,One of the important issues they discussed was that
00:10:48.840,00:10:50.800,就是埃及由于经济困难,,,
00:10:50.800,00:10:53.240,要求推迟偿还中国政府提供的,00:10:49.820,00:10:54.120,"Egypt requested to delay debt repayment to China
because of economic difficulties."
00:10:53.240,00:10:53.760,贷款,,,
00:10:54.520,00:10:56.720,埃及当时一年进口的消费品,00:10:54.440,00:10:57.920,"Egypt imported 9 billion USD of
consumer goods a year"
00:10:56.720,00:10:57.880,要90亿美元,,,
00:10:58.480,00:11:00.760,而埃及当时一年的外汇收入,00:10:58.220,00:11:01.660,"while foreign exchange income was just
7 billion USD."
00:11:00.760,00:11:01.840,只有70亿美元,,,
00:11:02.000,00:11:04.760,恩那么穆巴拉克执政了将近30,00:11:02.385,00:11:05.395,Mubarak had been in power for over 30 years.
00:11:04.760,00:11:05.080,年,,,
00:11:05.120,00:11:07.240,它进行一些结构性的,,,
00:11:07.440,00:11:09.320,经济方面的改革和调整,00:11:05.400,00:11:09.480,"He instituted reforms and conducted
structural adjustment to the economy,"
00:11:09.600,00:11:12.680,但始终没有形成足够的创造,00:11:09.560,00:11:14.320,"but he still failed to generate a strong manufacturing
industry for enough employment opportunities ."
00:11:12.680,00:11:14.160,足够就业的制造业,,,
00:11:14.400,00:11:15.640,所以从粮食,00:11:14.440,00:11:16.600,So Egypt relied on the import
00:11:15.640,00:11:17.480,到许多日常生活的用品,,,
00:11:17.600,00:11:18.680,都依赖进口,00:11:16.600,00:11:19.220,of crops and many daily necessities.
00:11:19.480,00:11:22.400,那么在经济状况恶化的同时,00:11:19.220,00:11:22.300,"As the economy worsened,"
00:11:22.520,00:11:24.480,腐败变得越来越严重,00:11:22.305,00:11:25.435,corruption became more severe.
00:11:24.560,00:11:26.280,坊间就开始流传,,,
00:11:26.320,00:11:27.240,各种版本的,00:11:25.440,00:11:28.560,"Rumors were everywhere about
corrupt senior government officials,"
00:11:27.240,00:11:28.640,政府高官的腐败,,,
00:11:28.640,00:11:31.080,特别是穆巴拉克家族的腐败,00:11:28.560,00:11:31.040,especially Mubarak's family.
00:11:31.640,00:11:32.680,一般人都认为,,,
00:11:32.720,00:11:33.960,他的家族在海外,00:11:31.520,00:11:33.920,People thought his family illegally owned
00:11:34.000,00:11:36.000,拥有上百亿美元的赃款,00:11:34.020,00:11:36.235,over ten billion U.S. dollars overseas.
00:11:36.400,00:11:37.760,但究竟是否属实,,,
00:11:37.760,00:11:39.280,最后也没有证实,00:11:36.240,00:11:39.300,"Although, in the end, there was no proof,"
00:11:39.400,00:11:41.160,在这些坊间的传闻,,,
00:11:41.160,00:11:43.200,损害了穆兹穆巴拉克在埃及的,00:11:39.520,00:11:43.500,these rumors jeopardized Mubarak's prestige in Egypt.
00:11:43.200,00:11:43.840,威信,,,
00:11:44.800,00:11:47.000,那么埃及曾经是法国和英国的,00:11:44.500,00:11:47.640,"Since it used to be the colony of the UK and France,"
00:11:47.000,00:11:47.760,殖民地,,,
00:11:47.800,00:11:50.840,所以继承了不少殖民地时代,00:11:47.680,00:11:51.440,Egypt inherited many traditions during the colonial times.
00:11:50.840,00:11:52.200,留下来的传统,,,
00:11:52.520,00:11:55.240,比方他政府的上层官员高官,00:11:52.700,00:11:55.140,The senior government officials in Egypt
00:11:55.360,00:11:57.920,大都在欧美国家受过教育,00:11:55.140,00:11:57.860,mostly completed their education in Europe or America.
00:11:58.160,00:12:01.080,这些人与本国的老百姓,00:11:57.960,00:12:02.100,They are out of touch with their people.
00:12:01.320,00:12:02.440,脱节脱的厉害,,,
00:12:03.240,00:12:05.720,导致了国家治理水平比较低,00:12:03.000,00:12:05.740,This leads to low governance competence.
00:12:06.280,00:12:07.400,那么1987年,,,
00:12:07.400,00:12:09.800,我随时任的副总理李鹏,00:12:05.980,00:12:09.320,"In 1987, I followed Deputy Prime Minister, Li Peng"
00:12:09.800,00:12:11.560,去考察阿斯旺水坝,00:12:09.320,00:12:11.860,"to visit the Aswan Dam
[the world's largest embankment dam]"
00:12:12.280,00:12:13.200,当时陪我们的是,,,
00:12:13.200,00:12:15.880,埃及电力部的一位副部长,00:12:12.120,00:12:15.980,"We were accompanied by the
Deputy Minister of Electricity."
00:12:16.440,00:12:17.440,他全程陪同,00:12:16.180,00:12:18.640,He accompanied us the whole time.
00:12:17.440,00:12:18.680,他是留学英国的,,,
00:12:18.840,00:12:20.240,江口漂亮的英文,00:12:18.760,00:12:20.860,He studied in the U.K. and spoke English fluently.
00:12:20.680,00:12:22.760,他李鹏当时副总理就问他说,,,
00:12:22.760,00:12:25.200,开罗居民一度电是多少钱,00:12:20.900,00:12:25.020,"Deputy Prime Minister, Li Peng asked him
the price of one kilowatt-hour of electricity."
00:12:25.680,00:12:27.440,这副部长搞不清楚,00:12:25.200,00:12:28.700,"The Deputy Minster didn't know and
asked his subordinate."
00:12:27.560,00:12:29.200,然后忙着问他的下属,,,
00:12:29.200,00:12:29.840,也搞不清楚,,,
00:12:29.840,00:12:31.040,再问另外一个人,00:12:28.700,00:12:31.220,"His subordinate had no clue either and
asked another person."
00:12:31.400,00:12:33.120,最后才给了一个答复,00:12:31.220,00:12:33.380,"In the end, they provided an answer."
00:12:33.520,00:12:35.640,当时李鹏就对我感叹,00:12:33.520,00:12:37.040,"Li Peng sighed, telling me that
they were very bureaucratic,"
00:12:35.640,00:12:37.000,他说真官僚,,,
00:12:37.480,00:12:40.200,但这个话你不要翻译过去哈哈哈,00:12:37.080,00:12:39.980,but not to translate this [back to the Egyptians].
00:12:40.840,00:12:42.840,其实这种上下脱节的情况,00:12:40.680,00:12:44.660,"Actually, this situation is ubiquitous
in developing countries."
00:12:42.840,00:12:44.800,在发展中国家极为普遍,,,
00:12:44.840,00:12:47.360,上层基因大都是出生豪门,00:12:44.940,00:12:47.400,"The upper-class elites are born rich,"
00:12:47.800,00:12:49.160,在西方接受教育,00:12:47.640,00:12:49.360,"educated in western countries,"
00:12:49.200,00:12:51.800,但与本国的社会严重脱节,00:12:49.360,00:12:51.900,but severely disconnected from their own society.
00:12:51.800,00:12:53.680,官僚习气极重,,,
00:12:53.800,00:12:55.960,对百姓的疾苦不闻不问,00:12:51.980,00:12:55.840,"They are very bureaucratic and ignorant
of their people's misery."
00:12:56.280,00:12:57.600,那么中国政治文化中,,,
00:12:57.600,00:12:58.720,有一个很好的传统,00:12:56.000,00:12:59.480,"They don't have the same tradition
as in the Chinese political culture"
00:12:58.760,00:12:59.600,就为官一任,,,
00:12:59.640,00:13:00.600,造福一方,,,
00:13:01.000,00:13:02.200,在这些国家里,00:12:59.480,00:13:03.200,"""A term served is a region benefited."""
00:13:02.240,00:13:03.680,没有这样的传统,,,
00:13:04.400,00:13:05.360,那么借此机会,00:13:04.140,00:13:06.800,I would also like to take this opportunity
00:13:05.400,00:13:08.560,我也对于李鹏同志的去世,,,
00:13:08.640,00:13:10.280,表示沉痛的哀悼,00:13:06.800,00:13:10.500,"to extend my condolence for the
passing of Comrade Li Peng,"
00:13:10.520,00:13:11.840,因为80年代的时候,,,
00:13:11.840,00:13:13.720,我曾经多次陪同他出访,00:13:10.620,00:13:13.820,as I accompanied him to visit multiple countries in the 1980s.
00:13:14.080,00:13:16.040,我自己可以再给大家回忆一段,00:13:13.980,00:13:16.660,I can share another memory with you.
00:13:16.040,00:13:16.760,往事,,,
00:13:17.520,00:13:18.920,就1985年7月,00:13:17.260,00:13:20.460,"In July 1985, I accompanied him to visit the United States."
00:13:18.920,00:13:20.760,我陪他去访问美国,,,
00:13:20.920,00:13:23.200,我们走访了美国一个著名的智库,00:13:20.620,00:13:24.780,We visited a famous think tank called RAND Corporation.
00:13:23.200,00:13:24.560,叫兰德公司,,,
00:13:24.880,00:13:26.320,当时李鹏就开玩笑问,,,
00:13:26.320,00:13:27.840,兰德公司的研究人员说,00:13:24.900,00:13:28.120,Li Peng made a joke and asked the researchers
00:13:27.880,00:13:29.520,我们中国提出了,,,
00:13:29.760,00:13:31.560,国内生产总值,00:13:28.120,00:13:34.500,"that China proposed to quadruple our GDP
by the end of this century,"
00:13:31.560,00:13:34.480,到本世纪末之前要翻两番,,,
00:13:34.920,00:13:38.080,也就是说在1980年的基础上,00:13:35.000,00:13:37.000,"which is to say,"
00:13:38.160,00:13:39.640,要增加4倍,00:13:37.200,00:13:39.960,to increase four times compared to that of 1980.
00:13:40.040,00:13:41.040,李鹏就问他们说,,,
00:13:41.040,00:13:42.000,你们认为,00:13:40.100,00:13:43.640,"Li Peng asked them by how much we should
increase the output of electricity"
00:13:42.200,00:13:43.280,如果这样做的话,,,
00:13:43.320,00:13:44.520,我们的中国的电力,,,
00:13:44.560,00:13:45.800,应该增加多少,00:13:43.640,00:13:46.000,if we wanted to achieve that goal.
00:13:46.680,00:13:47.600,对方呢说,,,
00:13:48.040,00:13:49.680,还没有研究过这个问题,00:13:46.495,00:13:49.555,They said they hadn't researched this problem
00:13:49.840,00:13:53.080,但是可以为中国政府做这个项目,00:13:49.600,00:13:53.280,but they can do the project for the Chinese government.
00:13:53.600,00:13:54.520,李鹏就笑了,,,
00:13:54.520,00:13:55.200,说谢谢你们,,,
00:13:55.200,00:13:56.120,他说我们实际上,00:13:53.480,00:13:57.940,"Li Peng laughed and thanked them, saying that we
already have conducted the research."
00:13:56.120,00:13:57.920,自己已经进行了这项研究啊,,,
00:13:58.840,00:14:00.600,那么离开兰德公司之后,00:13:58.540,00:14:01.400,"After leaving the RAND Corporation, Li Peng"
00:14:00.640,00:14:02.400,李鹏在车上就对我们,,,
00:14:02.760,00:14:05.120,其实他说这个问题是小平同志,00:14:01.400,00:14:07.300,"said to us that Comrade Xiaoping
was the first person to raise this concern."
00:14:05.240,00:14:07.840,最早提的,,,
00:14:07.920,00:14:09.000,直接问李鹏,,,
00:14:09.040,00:14:11.720,当时李鹏是负责中国的电力,00:14:08.180,00:14:12.160,"He asked Li Peng directly,
who was in charge of China's electricity."
00:14:12.240,00:14:13.920,那么小平问电的问题,00:14:12.160,00:14:13.880,"Deng Xiaoping asked,"
00:14:13.920,00:14:15.080,到本世纪末,,,
00:14:15.120,00:14:16.600,我们到底要搞到多少,00:14:13.880,00:14:18.220,"by how much do we have to increase our electrical
output, to ensure that the economy quadruples?"
00:14:16.600,00:14:18.400,才能保证经济翻两番,,,
00:14:18.840,00:14:21.400,快李鹏就开始做这个研究,00:14:18.600,00:14:21.140,"Then Li Peng started the research,"
00:14:21.800,00:14:24.440,而且最终提出了一个相当宏伟,00:14:21.920,00:14:25.860,"and raised a ambitious, but also attainable goal."
00:14:24.480,00:14:26.280,但也可以实现的目标,,,
00:14:26.920,00:14:28.320,大家是否知道,,,
00:14:28.360,00:14:31.360,今天我们整个中国一年的总,00:14:26.600,00:14:32.420,"Do you know the total power generation capacity
of entire China in one year?"
00:14:31.360,00:14:32.880,发电量是多少呢,,,
00:14:33.520,00:14:34.680,2018年,,,
00:14:34.720,00:14:37.480,是7万亿千瓦时,00:14:33.240,00:14:37.020,"It was seven trillion kilowatt-hours in 2018,"
00:14:37.920,00:14:41.240,几乎接近世界7个主要工业国的,00:14:37.680,00:14:42.740,"almost the total of combined power generation
of the seven major industrial countries"
00:14:41.240,00:14:42.800,发电量的总和,,,
00:14:43.080,00:14:44.280,说我们1949年,,,
00:14:44.320,00:14:45.960,发电量1000多倍,00:14:42.880,00:14:46.200,also over 1000 times of total power generation in 1949.
00:14:47.040,00:14:48.840,所以今天我们这么大一个国家,00:14:47.040,00:14:49.540,"So today, in a vast country,"
00:14:48.840,00:14:51.440,现在赶上今年这么炎热的夏天,00:14:49.540,00:14:51.680,"in such a scorching summer,"
00:14:51.440,00:14:52.840,大家都用空调,,,
00:14:53.480,00:14:55.440,但整个中国没有电荒,00:14:51.680,00:14:55.880,"we all use air conditioning, but we don't lack electricity."
00:14:55.840,00:14:57.080,这次热浪袭来,,,
00:14:57.120,00:14:59.840,纽约已经大停电两次了,00:14:55.880,00:14:58.800,"When the heat wave hit,
New York had two power outages,"
00:15:00.120,00:15:01.800,巴黎火车站也停电,00:14:59.560,00:15:02.240,"and train stations in Paris also
experienced power outages."
00:15:02.280,00:15:04.760,所以我们说饮水不忘掘井人,00:15:02.240,00:15:05.135,"""Never forget the well digger when drinking water."""
00:15:05.160,00:15:06.520,当年李鹏副总理,,,
00:15:06.520,00:15:08.360,在小平同志的领导下,00:15:05.135,00:15:08.145,"Under the lead of Deng Xiaoping,
Deputy Prime Minister Li Peng"
00:15:08.360,00:15:11.360,主管中国的电力工业和教育,00:15:08.145,00:15:11.435,"was in charge of electricity, industry, and education."
00:15:11.920,00:15:14.360,可以说是旦今节律超符合的工作,00:15:11.580,00:15:14.645,He devoted himself to his work.
00:15:14.400,00:15:16.960,我是这段历史的见证人,00:15:14.780,00:15:17.180,"I one of the witnesses of the developments
in our electrical industry."
00:15:17.680,00:15:19.240,在今天可以告慰李鹏的,00:15:17.380,00:15:20.040,"What may comfort Li Peng is,"
00:15:19.240,00:15:19.400,是,,,
00:15:19.400,00:15:21.120,中国已经是世界发电,,,
00:15:21.120,00:15:23.200,供应量最充沛的国家,00:15:20.065,00:15:22.825,"China is now the country with the most abundant power
generation supply in the world,"
00:15:23.480,00:15:25.600,也是世界上夜晚,,,
00:15:25.600,00:15:28.000,灯光最明亮的国家,00:15:23.240,00:15:28.040,and it is also the brightest country in the world at night.
00:15:28.120,00:15:29.800,有时候都不想加之一,00:15:28.040,00:15:30.080,"Sometimes I even don't want to add ""one of""."
00:15:31.880,00:15:34.080,我们要向新中国所有的电力,00:15:30.860,00:15:35.340,We want to pay tribute to all electricity workers in China.
00:15:34.080,00:15:35.240,工作者致敬,,,
00:15:35.240,00:15:36.920,你们是世界最棒的,00:15:35.340,00:15:37.140,You are the best in the world.
00:15:38.640,00:15:39.200,谢谢谢谢,,,
00:15:41.320,00:15:43.680,让我们还是回到A集团,00:15:41.640,00:15:43.480,Let's get back to Egypt.
00:15:44.280,00:15:46.120,由于外部和内部的原因,00:15:43.960,00:15:45.720,"Due to internal and external reasons,"
00:15:46.400,00:15:48.480,埃及的民生啊呃没有搞好,00:15:46.165,00:15:49.115,the life quality in Egypt didn't improve
00:15:48.720,00:15:50.960,各种社会矛盾日益尖锐,00:15:49.120,00:15:51.800,"and various social contradictions
are becoming increasingly acute."
00:15:51.160,00:15:53.360,整个社会就像铺满了干柴,,,
00:15:53.360,00:15:57.000,只等着一点火星就会燃烧爆炸,00:15:51.800,00:15:57.340,"The whole society is like being covered with dry wood,
and only a little spark will make it burn and explode."
00:15:57.440,00:15:59.440,所以突尼斯小贩自焚的事件,00:15:57.580,00:16:00.820,"The small vendor burning himself
became the little spark,"
00:15:59.440,00:16:00.680,成了这颗火星,,,
00:16:00.680,00:16:02.640,引发了这场动荡与革命,00:16:00.820,00:16:02.820,triggering this turmoil and revolution.
00:16:03.160,00:16:04.600,但是革命是浪漫的,,,
00:16:04.600,00:16:04.880,革命,,,
00:16:04.880,00:16:06.040,后的问题更复杂,00:16:03.100,00:16:07.040,"Revolution is romantic, but the issues
afterwards are complicated and severe."
00:16:06.040,00:16:07.320,甚至更严重,,,
00:16:07.640,00:16:09.560,埃及许多深层次的问题,00:16:07.385,00:16:10.655,Lots of deep-rooted issues are unsolvable.
00:16:09.600,00:16:10.720,根本解决不了,,,
00:16:11.360,00:16:14.120,那么从我自己的实地考察来看,00:16:11.085,00:16:14.055,"From my own experience of field trips,"
00:16:14.400,00:16:15.560,阿拉伯国家,,,
00:16:15.920,00:16:17.520,只要真的搞普选,00:16:14.060,00:16:18.040,"as long as Arab countries really implement
universal suffrage, ""one person one vote"","
00:16:17.520,00:16:18.680,一人一票的话,,,
00:16:18.880,00:16:21.640,上台的一定是伊斯兰势力,00:16:18.720,00:16:23.760,"Islamic forces, rather than
Pro-Western liberal forces will come into power."
00:16:21.920,00:16:24.160,而不是亲西方的自由派势力,,,
00:16:24.680,00:16:27.080,那么埃及之春爆发后的大选中,00:16:24.680,00:16:27.320,"In the presidential election following the ""Arab Spring"","
00:16:27.080,00:16:28.600,果然穆斯林兄弟会的,,,
00:16:28.600,00:16:30.480,穆尔西上台了,00:16:27.340,00:16:30.180,"Mohamed Morsi, from the Muslim Brotherhood,
came to power as expected."
00:16:31.000,00:16:33.240,之后埃及马上就陷入了,00:16:30.760,00:16:35.080,Then Egypt started struggling over Secular versus Islamic.
00:16:33.240,00:16:33.960,伊斯兰派,,,
00:16:33.960,00:16:36.040,与世俗派的不停的争议,,,
00:16:36.560,00:16:38.280,那么选举政治史,,,
00:16:38.400,00:16:40.840,这两大派的矛盾不断加深,00:16:36.360,00:16:40.300,"Electoral politics deepened the conflicts
between the two major factions -"
00:16:40.920,00:16:42.200,双方都不妥协,00:16:40.760,00:16:42.180,"both refused to compromise,"
00:16:42.240,00:16:43.640,结果就是国家动荡,00:16:42.180,00:16:44.360,"leading to the country's chaos,"
00:16:43.640,00:16:44.680,资本外逃,,,
00:16:44.680,00:16:45.520,企业倒闭,,,
00:16:45.560,00:16:46.520,物价飞涨,00:16:44.360,00:16:47.780,"capital flights, bankruptcies, and
soaring prices and crime rates."
00:16:46.560,00:16:47.840,犯罪率飙升,,,
00:16:48.760,00:16:50.320,那么最后是2013年7月,,,
00:16:50.320,00:16:51.320,军队有8年了,00:16:48.500,00:16:52.480,"Finally in July 2013, the army removed
the elected President Morsi from office,"
00:16:51.320,00:16:53.160,民选出来的穆尔西总统,,,
00:16:53.520,00:16:55.640,当然后来导致一些新的动荡,00:16:53.540,00:16:55.920,of course resulting in some new turmoil.
00:16:56.400,00:16:59.000,当时西方欢呼阿拉伯之春的时候,00:16:56.460,00:16:59.820,"When Westerners celebrated the ""Arab Spring"","
00:16:59.000,00:17:01.640,很多埃及人当时也高兴认为,00:16:59.840,00:17:01.840,many Egyptians were happy too.
00:17:01.640,00:17:03.480,只要采用西方民主模式,00:17:01.840,00:17:05.400,"They believed all their issues could be solved by
adopting a model resembling western democracy."
00:17:03.760,00:17:05.200,他们的困难都可以解决,,,
00:17:05.920,00:17:07.560,但实践证明埃及的问题,,,
00:17:07.560,00:17:09.600,不是一个民主与专制的问题,00:17:05.620,00:17:09.660,"However, this example tells us that the Egypt's problem
was not about democracy or autocracy,"
00:17:09.800,00:17:12.200,而是国家治理好坏的问题,00:17:09.660,00:17:12.620,but whether the country was well governed or not.
00:17:12.320,00:17:13.840,如果是民主与专制问题,,,
00:17:13.880,00:17:15.760,那么埃及照搬西方民主模式,00:17:12.740,00:17:15.080,"If the issue was about democracy or autocracy,"
00:17:15.800,00:17:17.400,就可以解决所有的问题,00:17:15.080,00:17:17.640,"then Egypt could have solved all problems
by copying the western democratic model."
00:17:17.880,00:17:18.840,但实际上,,,
00:17:18.880,00:17:19.760,我刚才提到,00:17:17.840,00:17:21.020,"But in fact, the entrenched problems I mentioned earlier,"
00:17:19.760,00:17:21.400,埃及的一些深层次的问题,,,
00:17:21.400,00:17:22.960,人口爆炸的问题,,,
00:17:23.440,00:17:24.280,贫穷问题,00:17:21.020,00:17:26.300,"such as population explosion, destitution,
and economic structure -"
00:17:24.280,00:17:25.400,贫困问题,,,
00:17:25.640,00:17:26.760,经济结构问题,,,
00:17:27.080,00:17:28.800,西方模式一个都解决不了,00:17:26.300,00:17:28.880,"not a single one of them can be resolved
by the western model."
00:17:29.080,00:17:29.960,非但解决不了,,,
00:17:29.960,00:17:31.720,还会使这些问题恶化,00:17:28.940,00:17:31.760,"On the contrary, the western model can
even exacerbate those problems."
00:17:32.200,00:17:33.400,这就是阿拉伯之春,,,
00:17:33.400,00:17:35.400,迅速变成阿拉伯之冬的,00:17:31.940,00:17:36.060,"This is a direct reason that the ""Arab Spring""
rapidly turned into the ""Arab Winter""."
00:17:35.400,00:17:36.480,一个直接的原因,,,
00:17:37.360,00:17:40.040,我觉得中国成语水土不服,00:17:37.140,00:17:39.820,"I think the Chinese idiom from our ancestors
""not acclimatized to the local water and soil"""
00:17:40.280,00:17:42.400,可以很好的解释这一切,00:17:40.040,00:17:42.120,can explain it very well.
00:17:42.760,00:17:43.480,所以我觉得,,,
00:17:43.480,00:17:45.320,我们古人真是很有智慧的,00:17:42.600,00:17:45.120,They are really full of wisdom.
00:17:45.680,00:17:46.480,所以说不服,,,
00:17:46.480,00:17:49.120,我查了一下最早的出租三国之中,00:17:45.560,00:17:48.100,I looked up the idiom's origin - it was first used in
00:17:49.120,00:17:50.080,的周瑜传,00:17:48.100,00:17:50.320,"The Biography of Zhou Yu, Records of the Three Kingdoms"
00:17:50.520,00:17:53.080,也就是说不惜水土必生疾病,00:17:50.520,00:17:53.320,"""You will get sick if you are not accustomed to the water and soil.”"
00:17:53.920,00:17:55.360,水土两个字的用法,00:17:53.720,00:17:56.760,"The use of these two words
""water and soil' is very accurate."
00:17:55.400,00:17:56.720,非常精到,,,
00:17:57.120,00:17:58.040,我觉得可以成为,,,
00:17:58.040,00:18:00.160,中国本土政治话语的一部分,00:17:56.840,00:17:59.920,This can be a part of China's native political discourse.
00:18:00.560,00:18:01.800,我们看任何一个国家,,,
00:18:01.800,00:18:02.800,任何一个社会,00:18:00.260,00:18:04.800,Any country and society is comprised of at least four pillars -
00:18:02.920,00:18:05.040,它至少包括4个层面,,,
00:18:05.360,00:18:06.000,政治,,,
00:18:06.160,00:18:06.760,经济,00:18:05.100,00:18:08.140,"politics, economy, society, and culture."
00:18:06.800,00:18:07.400,社会,,,
00:18:07.400,00:18:08.120,文化,,,
00:18:08.760,00:18:11.080,文化是最根本的渗透到各个,00:18:08.160,00:18:10.960,"Culture is fundamental, as it permeates everywhere."
00:18:11.080,00:18:11.720,方面的,,,
00:18:11.880,00:18:13.560,所以我们讲水土不服,00:18:10.960,00:18:13.920,"So when we talk about ""not acclimatized the local water and soil"","
00:18:13.600,00:18:14.760,水就是文化,,,
00:18:15.120,00:18:16.440,甚至到一切领域的,00:18:14.020,00:18:17.040,"water refers to culture, permeating everywhere,"
00:18:17.560,00:18:18.400,政治土壤,,,
00:18:18.680,00:18:19.440,经济土壤,00:18:17.040,00:18:20.520,"and the soil is the political soil,
the economic soil, and the societal soil."
00:18:19.560,00:18:20.360,社会土壤,,,
00:18:20.880,00:18:22.280,那么西方的政治模式,,,
00:18:22.280,00:18:23.240,到阿拉伯世界,00:18:20.620,00:18:24.760,"The Western political model failed to ""acclimatize to the local water and soil"" in Arab world."
00:18:23.240,00:18:25.400,就出现了严重的水土不服,,,
00:18:25.680,00:18:26.800,我们先来看水,,,
00:18:26.920,00:18:28.040,也就是文化,00:18:25.480,00:18:28.575,Let's talk about water first - the culture.
00:18:28.360,00:18:31.320,那么埃及深受伊斯兰文化的影响,00:18:28.575,00:18:31.255,Egypt is deeply influenced by Islamic culture.
00:18:32.000,00:18:36.080,清真寺宣礼塔一日5次的祷告声,00:18:31.425,00:18:34.535,Mosques. Minarets.
00:18:36.080,00:18:37.200,不绝于耳,00:18:34.540,00:18:37.080,Praying five times a day; never-ending prayers.
00:18:37.800,00:18:39.760,虽然也有所谓世俗派,00:18:37.580,00:18:39.960,"Although there are secular sects,"
00:18:39.920,00:18:41.280,但在社会底层,,,
00:18:41.480,00:18:42.800,伊斯兰教的影响,00:18:39.960,00:18:43.620,"the influence of Islam is far greater than that of
secular sects at the bottom of society."
00:18:42.800,00:18:44.160,远远大于史书派,,,
00:18:44.600,00:18:46.480,而且从政治文化来说,00:18:44.315,00:18:47.325,"From the perspective of political culture,"
00:18:46.520,00:18:49.600,伊斯兰势力和世俗势力之间,,,
00:18:49.600,00:18:52.080,存在着难以调和的矛盾,00:18:47.325,00:18:52.260,"irreconcilable contradictions exist between
Islamic forces and secular forces."
00:18:52.280,00:18:54.440,双方的矛盾由来已久,00:18:52.480,00:18:54.520,The contradictions are long-standing.
00:18:54.440,00:18:56.240,一方得失就完全排除,00:18:54.520,00:18:56.960,"As soon as one party gains power,
it aims to eliminate the other."
00:18:56.240,00:18:57.840,另外一方另一方得失,,,
00:18:57.840,00:18:59.200,就实行政治清算,00:18:57.140,00:19:00.380,"When the other party regains power,
they purge and avenge."
00:18:59.200,00:19:00.200,残酷的报复,,,
00:19:01.040,00:19:03.080,所以缺乏这种妥协和包容的,00:19:01.000,00:19:04.740,"Therefore, their political culture and tradition lacks
compromise and tolerance."
00:19:03.080,00:19:05.240,政治文化和政治传统,,,
00:19:05.400,00:19:07.520,那么搞西方竞选民主过程,00:19:05.220,00:19:08.060,"When they adopted the Western electoral process,"
00:19:07.520,00:19:09.160,就是不断加深分歧,,,
00:19:09.480,00:19:10.520,激化矛盾,00:19:08.060,00:19:11.460,"they continuously deepened their
discrepancies, intensified conflicts,"
00:19:10.600,00:19:12.200,深化对抗的过程,,,
00:19:12.200,00:19:12.440,结果,,,
00:19:12.440,00:19:14.240,社会更大的撕裂,00:19:11.900,00:19:14.200,and further tore apart their society.
00:19:14.880,00:19:16.240,我们再来看政治土壤,00:19:14.600,00:19:16.380,Let's take a look at the political soil.
00:19:16.800,00:19:17.600,那么埃及内部啊,,,
00:19:17.600,00:19:19.520,主要有三股政治力量,00:19:16.460,00:19:19.440,"There are three political forces inside Egypt,"
00:19:20.000,00:19:20.880,伊斯兰派,,,
00:19:21.400,00:19:22.240,四处派,00:19:19.760,00:19:23.280,"the Islamist, the secular, and the army."
00:19:22.280,00:19:23.440,还有军队,,,
00:19:24.000,00:19:26.160,其中伊斯兰派和世俗派,00:19:23.740,00:19:27.240,"The Islamist and the secular have been
at odds for a long time."
00:19:26.160,00:19:27.280,是长期对立的,,,
00:19:27.280,00:19:29.640,主要分歧是建立什么样的国家,00:19:27.440,00:19:29.940,"The main difference is about what kind
of a country should be built."
00:19:30.120,00:19:32.120,伊斯兰派主张建立哈里发,00:19:30.040,00:19:33.600,The Islamists advocate the establishment of a Caliphate. [Islamic state under the leadership of a steward]
00:19:32.160,00:19:33.800,宗教的这种政治制度,,,
00:19:33.960,00:19:36.400,他们认为埃及那错误的道路上,00:19:33.700,00:19:37.300,"They think Egypt has been on the wrong
path for hundreds of years."
00:19:36.400,00:19:37.800,行走了百余年,,,
00:19:37.920,00:19:39.400,这种局面必须结束,00:19:37.500,00:19:39.440,That has to come to an end.
00:19:39.440,00:19:40.360,对他们来说,,,
00:19:40.360,00:19:41.360,阿拉伯之春,00:19:39.440,00:19:42.600,"The ""Arab Spring"" gave them a chance."
00:19:41.440,00:19:42.680,提供这么一个机会,,,
00:19:43.280,00:19:44.400,那么同样世俗派,00:19:43.000,00:19:45.680,"In the same way, the secularists want to
establish a secular state,"
00:19:44.400,00:19:45.840,要建立一个世俗国家,,,
00:19:46.000,00:19:49.000,不允许国家回到哈利法宗教国家,00:19:45.800,00:19:49.040,"not allowing the country to go back to
becoming a Caliphate."
00:19:50.240,00:19:51.920,那么我们再来看看经济土壤,00:19:49.920,00:19:51.920,Now let's look at the economic soil.
00:19:51.960,00:19:53.160,埃及当时的经济,,,
00:19:53.160,00:19:54.720,主要是4根支柱,00:19:51.920,00:19:54.720,The Egyptian economy had four pillars:
00:19:54.800,00:19:55.640,旅游业,,,
00:19:56.080,00:19:57.640,所以是任何的收入,00:19:54.720,00:19:58.760,"tourism, income from Suez Canal, overseas remittance,"
00:19:57.880,00:19:58.680,乔慧,,,
00:19:58.840,00:19:59.720,在国外的,,,
00:20:00.040,00:20:01.720,埃及侨民汇来的钱,00:19:58.760,00:20:02.960,"which is the money sent back from
overseas Egyptians, and petroleum."
00:20:01.760,00:20:02.920,还有石油,,,
00:20:03.560,00:20:04.840,那么跟我刚才讲,00:20:03.340,00:20:06.240,"As I have mentioned before,"
00:20:04.840,00:20:05.720,前面讲的一样,,,
00:20:05.720,00:20:09.320,这种经济结构它缺少制造业,00:20:06.360,00:20:10.280,"the economic structure lacked
manufacturing and real economy."
00:20:09.440,00:20:10.840,缺少实体经济,,,
00:20:11.120,00:20:12.920,所以对于一个人口近亿的,00:20:10.680,00:20:13.980,"For a big Middle Eastern country with
a population close to 100 million people,"
00:20:13.840,00:20:14.880,中东大国来说,,,
00:20:14.920,00:20:15.920,这种经济结构,00:20:13.980,00:20:17.800,this economic structure couldn't generate enough jobs.
00:20:15.960,00:20:18.040,无法创造足够的就业,,,
00:20:18.200,00:20:19.520,所以青年的事业问题,00:20:18.040,00:20:20.660,"Therefore, there was high youth unemployment."
00:20:19.520,00:20:20.480,一直难以解决,,,
00:20:21.080,00:20:22.160,这出现一种什么情况,00:20:21.060,00:20:22.440,This led to a situation
00:20:22.160,00:20:23.600,一旦没有政治高压,,,
00:20:23.600,00:20:24.720,没有穆巴拉克,00:20:22.460,00:20:25.120,"where if there was no political pressure and Mubarak's regime,"
00:20:24.880,00:20:26.680,青年人走上街头来,00:20:25.120,00:20:27.360,young people would come to the street.
00:20:26.680,00:20:28.840,街头政治又造成更大的政治不,,,
00:20:28.840,00:20:29.120,稳定,00:20:27.360,00:20:30.480,Street politics would cause more unrest and even violence.
00:20:29.160,00:20:30.480,甚至暴力冲突,,,
00:20:30.920,00:20:33.280,所以阿拉伯自身带来的动荡,00:20:30.880,00:20:35.240,"Therefore, ""Arab  Spring"" brought unrest,
bankruptcies, and capital flights."
00:20:33.280,00:20:34.200,企业倒闭,,,
00:20:34.200,00:20:35.640,资金外流,,,
00:20:35.840,00:20:37.000,所以民生问题,,,
00:20:37.000,00:20:38.520,即使埃及支撑,00:20:35.640,00:20:40.960,"The issue of livelihood was not only
one major reason to cause ""Arab Spring"","
00:20:38.640,00:20:40.040,发生的一个主要原因,,,
00:20:40.040,00:20:41.400,也是后来导致,,,
00:20:41.440,00:20:43.360,埃及进一步政治动荡的一个主要,00:20:41.260,00:20:44.100,"but also a major factor deepening
Egyptian political turmoil."
00:20:43.360,00:20:43.800,原因,,,
00:20:44.760,00:20:46.840,我们再来看社会土壤也是一样的,00:20:44.560,00:20:47.920,Then let's look at the societal soil.
00:20:46.840,00:20:48.440,随着互联网兴起,,,
00:20:48.800,00:20:50.920,随着经济形势的恶化,00:20:48.660,00:20:51.780,"With the rise of the Internet and the worsening of economy,"
00:20:50.920,00:20:52.560,美国等外部势力,,,
00:20:52.560,00:20:54.440,积极推动颜色革命,00:20:51.780,00:20:53.880,"external forces including the U.S.
actively promoted the ""color revolution""."
00:20:54.680,00:20:57.240,他社会思潮越来越极端化,00:20:54.500,00:20:57.240,Social trends were becoming increasingly extreme.
00:20:57.760,00:21:00.920,那么我们看到有一些报道,00:20:57.480,00:21:00.220,"We could see in the news,"
00:21:01.200,00:21:02.680,甚至主流媒体的报道,00:21:00.220,00:21:02.960,"even from mainstream foreign media,"
00:21:02.680,00:21:03.240,国外的,,,
00:21:03.280,00:21:05.440,我们国内也有说这场阿拉伯之春,00:21:03.200,00:21:05.440,"and also the domestic media,"
00:21:05.720,00:21:07.360,所以叫三无运动,00:21:05.440,00:21:08.060,"that the ""Arab Spring"" is a
""Three-No's"" political movement."
00:21:07.520,00:21:08.680,没有明确的纲领,,,
00:21:08.720,00:21:09.920,没有严密的组织,00:21:08.060,00:21:11.500,"No clear guiding principle, no coherent organization,
and no iconic leaders."
00:21:09.960,00:21:11.880,没有标志性的领袖人物,,,
00:21:12.200,00:21:13.840,实际上是不符合事实,00:21:11.940,00:21:14.280,"However, this is not true."
00:21:14.600,00:21:15.840,2012年的时候,,,
00:21:15.840,00:21:17.000,法国出版了一本,,,
00:21:17.000,00:21:19.240,专门研究阿拉伯革命的专著,00:21:14.480,00:21:20.700,"In 2012, a monograph on the
Arab revolution was published in France,"
00:21:19.280,00:21:20.840,阿拉伯之春的专著,,,
00:21:21.120,00:21:22.760,书名叫阿拉伯革命,,,
00:21:22.760,00:21:24.880,背后隐藏的一面,00:21:20.980,00:21:25.060,« La Face Cachee des Revolutions Arabes »
00:21:25.520,00:21:27.760,他这本书是由来自法国,00:21:25.200,00:21:27.900,This book was co-authored by 23 scholars from
00:21:27.760,00:21:28.400,比利时,,,
00:21:28.400,00:21:29.040,突尼斯,,,
00:21:29.040,00:21:31.280,阿尔及利亚等8个国家,00:21:27.900,00:21:33.240,"eight countries, including France, Belgium,
Algeria, and Tunisia, etc."
00:21:31.480,00:21:33.760,23名学者联合撰写,,,
00:21:34.600,00:21:35.280,那么这本书,,,
00:21:35.280,00:21:36.720,它里面提出一个观点,00:21:34.320,00:21:37.335,This book raises the view that
00:21:36.840,00:21:40.200,说美国是阿拉伯之春的背后推手,00:21:37.340,00:21:39.960,the U.S. pushed behind the Arab Spring.
00:21:40.320,00:21:41.760,他始终详细介绍,,,
00:21:41.800,00:21:44.640,美国是如何通过培训骨干,00:21:40.220,00:21:43.340,It details how the U.S. facilitated the Arab Spring
00:21:44.680,00:21:46.400,通过互联网的手段,00:21:43.340,00:21:48.000,"through training their key activists,
and by using the Internet."
00:21:46.480,00:21:48.600,促成了这场阿拉伯之春,,,
00:21:49.120,00:21:50.560,美国的一些所谓的,,,
00:21:50.600,00:21:52.280,非政府组织的基金会,00:21:49.080,00:21:52.240,Some so-called NGOs and foundations
00:21:52.280,00:21:54.720,深深的介入这场街头革命,00:21:52.240,00:21:54.820,were deeply engaged in this street revolution.
00:21:55.360,00:21:56.800,这本书列出了一些,00:21:55.080,00:21:57.975,"This book also lists some
famous American organizations,"
00:21:56.800,00:21:57.960,大名鼎鼎的美国机构,,,
00:21:57.960,00:21:59.760,我们可能都知道的,00:21:57.980,00:22:00.100,"which we all may know,"
00:22:00.440,00:22:02.240,全国民主基金会,00:22:00.400,00:22:04.300,"National Endowment for Democracy,
and Freedom House,"
00:22:02.760,00:22:03.960,自由之家,,,
00:22:04.240,00:22:06.160,美国国际发展史,00:22:04.300,00:22:06.400,"United States Agency for International Development,"
00:22:06.400,00:22:08.200,开放社会学院的,00:22:06.400,00:22:08.320,"and Open Society Institute, etc."
00:22:08.920,00:22:10.720,实际上后来东欧,00:22:08.940,00:22:11.765,"Actually, we can also see their shadows"
00:22:10.720,00:22:12.880,前苏联发生颜色革命,,,
00:22:13.160,00:22:14.320,我们都可以看到,00:22:11.765,00:22:14.660,"during the color revolution in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union."
00:22:14.320,00:22:15.480,这些机构的影子,,,
00:22:15.480,00:22:17.280,有的就是黑手直接操纵的,00:22:14.880,00:22:17.440,Some of them manipulated behind the scenes.
00:22:18.000,00:22:19.000,那么这本书还透露,,,
00:22:19.000,00:22:21.320,就早在阿拉伯之春爆发之前,00:22:17.780,00:22:20.260,This book also discloses that
00:22:21.320,00:22:23.040,从2002年起,00:22:20.260,00:22:23.320,"from 2002, way before thte ""Arab Spring"" broke out,"
00:22:23.720,00:22:24.920,上述这些机构,,,
00:22:24.920,00:22:27.320,就开始筹划阿拉伯革命,00:22:23.640,00:22:27.160,"those organizations started
planning the Arab Revolution."
00:22:27.880,00:22:28.960,从2005年,,,
00:22:28.960,00:22:31.040,到2011年的5年间,00:22:27.760,00:22:30.740,"In the 5 years from 2005 to 2010,"
00:22:31.040,00:22:33.640,他们培训了不少于1万名的,00:22:30.820,00:22:34.860,"they trained at least 10,000
Internet experts in Egypt,"
00:22:33.800,00:22:35.440,埃及的网络高手,,,
00:22:36.040,00:22:37.480,他每年为此投入,00:22:35.740,00:22:38.655,which cost them 20 million dollars yearly
00:22:37.520,00:22:38.880,将近2000万美元,,,
00:22:38.920,00:22:40.000,后来还翻倍,00:22:38.660,00:22:40.500,and the number doubled later.
00:22:40.960,00:22:41.960,正因为如此,00:22:40.680,00:22:42.060,"Because of this,"
00:22:41.960,00:22:43.600,到2012年的时候,,,
00:22:44.000,00:22:46.240,埃及的一些机构曾经指控,00:22:42.060,00:22:46.740,"in 2012, some Egyptian organizations
accused some of them of"
00:22:47.040,00:22:50.480,知道这一些人叫非法筹资民意,00:22:46.820,00:22:50.060,illegally raising funds.
00:22:50.760,00:22:53.400,但是美国国务院表示抗议,00:22:50.460,00:22:53.460,"However, the U.S. State Department objected it."
00:22:53.760,00:22:54.760,背后实际上,,,
00:22:54.760,00:22:55.400,美国公民,00:22:53.600,00:22:56.940,"So we can see U.S. citizens were
engaged in these activities."
00:22:55.400,00:22:57.120,参与了这样一些活动,,,
00:22:57.680,00:22:59.160,那么这本书里边,00:22:57.380,00:23:00.660,This book also reaches the conclusion
00:22:59.160,00:23:01.280,还做了一个总结,,,
00:23:01.280,00:23:04.160,说美国的介入啊分为两个层次,00:23:00.840,00:23:03.760,that intervention by the U.S. took place on two levels:
00:23:04.280,00:23:05.720,一个是网络空间,00:23:04.000,00:23:07.100,"the first is cyberspace, and the second is training activists."
00:23:05.760,00:23:07.320,另外就是培训骨干,,,
00:23:07.840,00:23:10.680,那么他们培训了一大批阿拉伯文,00:23:07.540,00:23:10.735,"So they trained a multitude of
Internet experts or influencers,"
00:23:10.680,00:23:12.280,是母语的网络高手,00:23:10.735,00:23:13.455,whose mother tongue are Arabic.
00:23:12.320,00:23:13.320,或者网络大堤,,,
00:23:13.360,00:23:16.400, D. 组成所谓的网络阿拉伯,00:23:13.815,00:23:16.835,"They formed the so-called Internet Arab Association,"
00:23:16.400,00:23:17.000,联盟,,,
00:23:17.360,00:23:18.920,在网络上设置议题,00:23:17.080,00:23:18.820,and set up topics on the Internet.
00:23:18.920,00:23:20.040,呼风唤雨,00:23:18.960,00:23:20.860,"They were ""summoning winds and calling for rain""."
00:23:20.720,00:23:23.120,他们根据美国颜色革命的专家,00:23:20.860,00:23:25.380,"According to Gene Sharp [American political scientist],"
00:23:23.320,00:23:24.720,叫金沙,,,
00:23:25.040,00:23:27.000,吉恩夏普的理论,,,
00:23:27.360,00:23:28.720,系统培训,00:23:25.380,00:23:30.900,"these organizations systematically
trained the backbone of street politics."
00:23:29.160,00:23:30.880,街头政治的骨干力量,,,
00:23:31.280,00:23:33.080,这些颜色革命套路,00:23:31.400,00:23:34.760,These methods used during the color revolution
00:23:33.240,00:23:34.680,最近在香港所谓的,,,
00:23:34.680,00:23:35.440,返修率的,,,
00:23:35.440,00:23:36.600,街头暴乱中,00:23:34.760,00:23:38.120,are ubiquitous in recent anti-extradition riots in Hong Kong
00:23:36.640,00:23:37.600,比比皆是,,,
00:23:37.880,00:23:39.840,从示威者的着装,00:23:38.120,00:23:41.480,"from the signs and outfits of the demonstrators,"
00:23:39.880,00:23:41.160,到标识,,,
00:23:41.240,00:23:43.440,到各级指挥者的,00:23:41.560,00:23:45.200,to the gestures used by their supervisors.
00:23:43.480,00:23:45.360,整齐划一的手势动作,,,
00:23:45.440,00:23:45.800,你一看,,,
00:23:45.800,00:23:48.360,就受过美国延伸革命专家训练的,00:23:45.580,00:23:48.860,"It is obvious that American color revolution experts
trained these demonstrators."
00:23:49.440,00:23:52.280,不久前网上流传过一个短视频,00:23:48.980,00:23:52.280,"Not a long time ago, a video circulated on the Internet"
00:23:52.440,00:23:54.440,就美国现任国务卿彭培奥,,,
00:23:54.720,00:23:56.080,在美国一个大学演讲,00:23:52.300,00:23:57.500,"that in a university speech, the current
U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo"
00:23:56.080,00:23:57.080,是公开承认,,,
00:23:57.200,00:23:59.520,他说我曾担任中央情报局局长,00:23:57.505,00:24:00.815,"publicly acknowledged that
when he was the Director of the CIA."
00:23:59.560,00:24:02.160,我们企业我们偷窃,,,
00:24:02.600,00:24:03.800,我们还有一门课程,00:24:01.160,00:24:05.420,"""We lied, deceived, and stole.
We had entire training courses."""
00:24:03.800,00:24:05.000,专门来教这些,,,
00:24:05.640,00:24:08.320,这才是美国不断探索进步的荣耀,00:24:05.480,00:24:07.960,"""It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment."""
00:24:08.320,00:24:09.320,它引以为豪,00:24:08.300,00:24:09.960,He is proud of it.
00:24:09.320,00:24:09.880,你知道吗,,,
00:24:10.640,00:24:11.240,那么实际上,,,
00:24:11.280,00:24:12.480,美国极端是极端,00:24:10.320,00:24:14.180,"Actually, American extremist forces
provide us with new lessons every day,"
00:24:12.520,00:24:14.720,是你天天在给我们上课,,,
00:24:14.880,00:24:17.960,天天在打我们国内工资的脸,00:24:14.800,00:24:18.020,"which also slap some Chinese
public intellectuals in the face every day."
00:24:17.960,00:24:20.040,使国人越来越清楚的了解到,,,
00:24:20.040,00:24:21.840,颜色革命的真相,00:24:18.220,00:24:23.700,"Chinese people are getting to know the truth behind
the color revolution and their orchestrators."
00:24:21.960,00:24:23.800,及策划者的真面目,,,
00:24:24.720,00:24:25.920,那么关心政治人,,,
00:24:25.920,00:24:27.040,可能也注意到,00:24:24.400,00:24:27.640,People interested in politics may have noticed that
00:24:27.400,00:24:28.920,阿拉伯之春爆发后,,,
00:24:28.960,00:24:30.160,西方主流媒体,,,
00:24:30.640,00:24:33.840,几乎是倾其全力来控制话语权,00:24:27.640,00:24:33.700,"western mainstream media did their utmost to control
public opinion after the ""Arab Spring""."
00:24:34.360,00:24:36.320,把这场运动描绘为,00:24:34.060,00:24:38.060,"They depicted the movement as a
spontaneous revolution of the masses"
00:24:36.320,00:24:38.480,群众的自发的革命,,,
00:24:38.760,00:24:40.880,任何发出不同声音的学者,,,
00:24:40.880,00:24:41.760,或者媒体,,,
00:24:42.040,00:24:43.440,马上给你戴上帽子,00:24:38.460,00:24:45.300,"and they attacked all media and scholars raising
different opinions as conspiracy theorists."
00:24:43.720,00:24:45.320,说你是叫阴谋论,,,
00:24:45.960,00:24:47.640,西方媒体把反政府者,,,
00:24:47.680,00:24:49.600,有意的塑造为英雄,00:24:45.720,00:24:49.860,"The western media intentionally portrayed
anti-government organizations as heroes"
00:24:50.040,00:24:52.000,把政府描绘成筷子手,00:24:49.860,00:24:52.180,and the government as a butcher.
00:24:53.000,00:24:55.400,那么我们在香港最近的事件中,00:24:52.700,00:24:55.400,"From what happened in Hong Kong,"
00:24:55.440,00:24:57.240,也完完整整看到了,,,
00:24:57.240,00:24:59.400,西方所谓新闻自由的媒体,00:24:55.560,00:25:01.840,"we saw clearly how the so-called ""western free press""
complied with the color revolution routine."
00:24:59.680,00:25:02.160,是如何配合颜色革命的套路,,,
00:25:02.760,00:25:03.960,如果在香港和埃及,00:25:02.440,00:25:05.320,"If there's any difference between Hong Kong and Egypt,"
00:25:03.960,00:25:04.880,有什么不同的话,,,
00:25:04.920,00:25:07.440,我想只是美国对香港的卷入,00:25:05.320,00:25:09.180,"I assume that would be the U.S. exerted
a larger and deeper involvement in Hong Kong."
00:25:07.520,00:25:09.240,更深更广,,,
00:25:09.320,00:25:10.640,尽管香港的人口,00:25:09.180,00:25:11.980,"Even though Hong Kong has less than
one tenth of the population of Egypt."
00:25:10.640,00:25:12.440,连埃及的1/10都不到,,,
00:25:13.680,00:25:16.120,这里我们不得不提出一个问题,00:25:13.680,00:25:16.020,We have to raise a question here:
00:25:16.520,00:25:19.200,美国为什么要整埃及总统,00:25:16.240,00:25:20.580,Why did America target Egypt's former president Mubarak?
00:25:19.200,00:25:20.040,穆巴拉克,,,
00:25:20.320,00:25:22.400,毕竟穆巴拉克很多年来,,,
00:25:22.440,00:25:25.120,被看作是美国的铁杆的朋友,00:25:20.660,00:25:24.740,"Mubarak had been regarded as America's
faithful friend for many years?"
00:25:26.280,00:25:28.560,那么刚才我引入一个中国概念,00:25:26.060,00:25:29.420,Just now I introduced a Chinese concept -
00:25:28.560,00:25:30.000,叫水土不服,,,
00:25:30.040,00:25:31.520,来分析阿拉伯之春,00:25:29.420,00:25:33.480,"""not acclimatize to the local water and soil"" to analyze why the ""Arab Spring"" turned into the ""Arab Winter""."
00:25:31.560,00:25:33.120,为什么会变成阿拉伯之春,,,
00:25:33.520,00:25:35.360,现在我引用一个英文概念,,,
00:25:35.520,00:25:37.200,叫deep sit,00:25:33.540,00:25:38.920,"Now I am introducing an English concept, ""deep state"""
00:25:37.440,00:25:39.280,可以翻成生存国家,,,
00:25:39.640,00:25:41.960,来解释为什么美国会支持,,,
00:25:42.040,00:25:43.760,推倒阿拉莫巴拉克,00:25:39.480,00:25:45.020,"to explain why the U.S. would overturn
their old friend, Mubarak."
00:25:44.000,00:25:45.240,这位美国的老朋友,,,
00:25:46.040,00:25:47.400,所谓生存国家,,,
00:25:47.400,00:25:50.360,我认为我叫国家背后的国家,00:25:45.780,00:25:49.860,"The deep state refers to ""a state behind the state""."
00:25:50.720,00:25:53.320,也就是真正影响,,,
00:25:53.480,00:25:54.840,美国国家行为,00:25:50.440,00:25:57.820,"A deep-level contact network that really influences America's state behavior,"
00:25:54.840,00:25:57.680,一个深层的联络网络,,,
00:25:58.480,00:26:00.840,特别是美国的军工复合体,00:25:58.200,00:26:02.220,"like its military-industrial complex, capital from Wall Street,"
00:26:00.960,00:26:02.640,华尔街的金融资本,,,
00:26:02.760,00:26:04.320,美国的中央情报局,00:26:02.220,00:26:05.720,"the CIA, and National Endowment for Democracy, etc."
00:26:04.320,00:26:06.080,还有民主基金会等等,,,
00:26:06.480,00:26:07.440,所以美国的总统,,,
00:26:07.440,00:26:08.400,还可以换来换去,,,
00:26:08.400,00:26:09.480,有的对你好一些,00:26:06.240,00:26:10.980,"So the American presidents come and go -
some are friendly and some are not,"
00:26:09.520,00:26:10.720,有的对你不那么好,,,
00:26:11.080,00:26:12.880,但深层国家的立场,00:26:11.180,00:26:14.320,but the position of the deep state is always consistent.
00:26:12.880,00:26:14.640,几乎是一以贯之的,,,
00:26:14.880,00:26:17.400,他一直致力于有计划的,00:26:14.600,00:26:17.760,They have been committed to overthrowing the systems
00:26:17.400,00:26:20.200,有预谋的推翻与美国不一样的,00:26:17.760,00:26:20.340,"which are different from theirs in a
planned and premeditated manner."
00:26:20.200,00:26:20.960,政治制度,,,
00:26:21.200,00:26:22.400,不光是针对中国,,,
00:26:22.440,00:26:23.920,对其他国家也是这样,00:26:20.965,00:26:23.945,"Not only against China, but also against other countries."
00:26:24.280,00:26:25.640,只要你的制度跟我不一样,00:26:24.000,00:26:26.280,"As long as you have a different political system,"
00:26:25.680,00:26:27.960,我就扶持你的敌对势力,,,
00:26:28.040,00:26:30.440,培养代理人培养第五纵队,00:26:26.280,00:26:30.180,"they would support your enemy, train proxies,
and the fifth column."
00:26:30.640,00:26:32.600,对于中国他们支持疆独,00:26:30.375,00:26:33.435,"For China, they support Xinjiang independence, Tibet independence, Taiwan independence,"
00:26:32.640,00:26:33.080,藏独,,,
00:26:33.120,00:26:36.200,台独港独支持持不同政见者等等,00:26:33.440,00:26:36.260,"Hong Kong independence, and people
with different political opinions."
00:26:36.720,00:26:37.480,那么这样做,,,
00:26:37.480,00:26:39.160,对美国有什么好处呢,00:26:36.440,00:26:39.220,What kind of benefits would they get from this?
00:26:39.640,00:26:43.760,首先要让美国立的代理人举证,00:26:39.380,00:26:43.540,"First, they let their proxy, who represents
their interests, take over the government,"
00:26:44.120,00:26:45.200,使你这个国家,,,
00:26:45.200,00:26:47.080,完全成为美国的附庸,00:26:44.020,00:26:47.220,making the country a vassal of America.
00:26:47.600,00:26:48.360,对他们来说,,,
00:26:48.400,00:26:50.200,穆巴拉克还不够亲美,00:26:47.300,00:26:50.260,"At that time, Mubarak was not close enough to U.S.,"
00:26:50.320,00:26:52.120,他的独立性还是太强,00:26:50.260,00:26:52.160,he was still independent.
00:26:53.120,00:26:54.720,那么华尔街金融资本,00:26:52.820,00:26:56.160,And Wall Street always supports the so-called democratization.
00:26:54.720,00:26:56.520,一贯支持所谓的民主化,,,
00:26:56.560,00:26:58.000,因为你一旦这么做,00:26:56.560,00:26:59.080,"Once a proxy appears,"
00:26:58.040,00:26:59.720,他就立马支持一个,,,
00:26:59.760,00:27:01.960,由美国代理人组成的政党,00:26:59.080,00:27:01.820,they will support the political party it becomes.
00:27:02.200,00:27:03.760,唯有政党当选,00:27:01.895,00:27:04.795,"Democracy is only realized if that
favored party is elected,"
00:27:03.800,00:27:04.720,你才是民主的,,,
00:27:04.720,00:27:06.080,否则就是假民主,00:27:04.800,00:27:06.820,otherwise it is a faux democracy.
00:27:06.560,00:27:08.400,背后是华尔街金融资本,,,
00:27:08.520,00:27:10.200,希望通过他的代理人,00:27:06.820,00:27:10.420,"Wall Street is behind that favored party, which wants to"
00:27:10.640,00:27:12.520,把你们国家和百姓的财富,00:27:10.420,00:27:13.200,rob the country and its people of their wealth.
00:27:12.520,00:27:13.400,洗劫一空,,,
00:27:14.640,00:27:15.640,那么如果这个目的,,,
00:27:15.640,00:27:16.720,不能完全达到,00:27:14.365,00:27:17.585,It doesn't matter if this objective is not fully achieved
00:27:16.760,00:27:17.720,也没有关系,,,
00:27:18.040,00:27:20.200,他至少可以搞乱你这个国家,00:27:17.760,00:27:21.300,"because at least they can disarray a country or a region,"
00:27:20.400,00:27:21.800,搞乱你这个地区,,,
00:27:21.800,00:27:22.960,乱到打内战,00:27:21.600,00:27:24.060,ideally leading to an internal war.
00:27:22.960,00:27:23.440,打仗,,,
00:27:23.480,00:27:24.400,那是最好的,,,
00:27:24.840,00:27:26.400,将美国的军工复合体,00:27:24.540,00:27:28.040,"Then the military-industrial complex of thte U.S.
can sell its weapons"
00:27:26.400,00:27:27.360,就可以大卖,,,
00:27:27.360,00:27:28.600,特卖他们的武器,,,
00:27:28.600,00:27:30.200,让你们互相厮杀,00:27:28.620,00:27:30.500,for the parties to fight each other.
00:27:31.680,00:27:34.680,所以其实早在上世纪50年代,00:27:31.800,00:27:34.080,"Back in the 1950s,"
00:27:34.680,00:27:37.800,美国时任总统艾森豪威尔本人,00:27:34.480,00:27:37.180,American president Dwight D. Eisenhower
00:27:38.040,00:27:40.760,就曾经要求美国社会警惕,00:27:37.740,00:27:40.500,requested that the American society
00:27:40.880,00:27:42.720,美国的军工复合体,,,
00:27:42.880,00:27:45.160,对美国政治体制的绑架,00:27:40.820,00:27:44.920,"be weary of the American military-industrial complex
abducting the American political system."
00:27:45.600,00:27:47.480,但现在看来这种绑架,00:27:45.280,00:27:49.280,"However, as it stands currently, the
abduction is getting worse,"
00:27:47.880,00:27:49.040,这是越来越严重,,,
00:27:49.600,00:27:51.160,这本身是美国自己,00:27:49.300,00:27:52.460,"which is also the root cause of many
problems in the U.S."
00:27:51.160,00:27:52.560,很多问题的根源,,,
00:27:52.800,00:27:55.520,也是今天世界很多动乱的根源,00:27:52.760,00:27:55.400,and many upheavals around the world.
00:27:56.640,00:27:58.800,那么通过以上对阿拉伯之春,00:27:56.300,00:28:00.380,"From the analysis above,"
00:27:58.800,00:28:00.360,变成阿拉伯之冬的分析,,,
00:28:00.360,00:28:02.440,我想从一个中国人的视角,,,
00:28:02.480,00:28:05.040,帮助大家了解什么叫阿拉伯之春,00:28:00.760,00:28:04.340,I want to help all of you understand from a Chinese perspective
00:28:05.440,00:28:07.520,为什么美国支持阿拉伯之春,00:28:04.600,00:28:07.360,"what the ""Arab Spring"" is, why the U.S. backed it,"
00:28:07.560,00:28:09.080,以及为什么阿拉伯之春,,,
00:28:09.080,00:28:11.040,必然会变成阿拉伯之冬,00:28:07.480,00:28:10.840,"and why the ""Arab Spring"" must become ""Arab Winter""."
00:28:11.400,00:28:12.840,那么了解了这一切,,,
00:28:12.840,00:28:15.240,我们就可以避免受骗上当,00:28:11.080,00:28:15.320,"Knowing all this, we can avoid being deceived,"
00:28:15.440,00:28:17.080,就可以更加坚定的,,,
00:28:17.560,00:28:19.920,沿着我们中国人自己探索,00:28:15.480,00:28:20.940,"and resolutely follow the successful path
explored by the our predecessors."
00:28:19.920,00:28:21.520,出了成功之路前行,,,
00:28:21.760,00:28:24.120,就可以让美国及其代理人,,,
00:28:24.120,00:28:25.720,对中国发动的颜色,00:28:21.500,00:28:28.020,"We can annihilate any color revolution
staged by America and its proxies"
00:28:25.720,00:28:26.760,革命的企图,,,
00:28:26.840,00:28:28.120,彻底化为泡影,,,
00:28:28.480,00:28:30.640,那么中华民族伟大复兴的前程,,,
00:28:30.640,00:28:33.280,也会变得更加的顺利,00:28:28.420,00:28:33.980,"so that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation
will become easier and smoother."
00:28:33.280,00:28:34.560,更加的精彩,,,
00:28:35.000,00:28:36.880,今天我就和大家讲这些,00:28:34.980,00:28:36.600,That's all for today.
00:28:36.880,00:28:37.880,谢谢大家,00:28:36.640,00:28:38.000,Thanks everyone.
00:28:38.880,00:28:39.240,好,,,
00:28:39.280,00:28:40.640,谢谢张老师的演讲,00:28:38.800,00:28:41.800,Thank you Professor Zhang for your speech.
00:28:41.040,00:28:43.280,告诉我们一个个阿拉伯之春的,,,
00:28:43.280,00:28:43.880,颜色革命,,,
00:28:43.880,00:28:46.680,最后是怎么变成阿拉伯之冬的,00:28:41.900,00:28:46.820,"He told us how the ""Arab Spring"" turned
into the ""Arab Winter""."
00:28:47.000,00:28:48.880,在颜色革命爆发的这些地区和,00:28:46.920,00:28:49.905,There may be some objective reasons in the countries
00:28:48.880,00:28:49.240,国家,,,
00:28:49.280,00:28:51.200,它可能有一部分客观的原因,00:28:49.905,00:28:52.425,where color revolutions broke out.
00:28:51.400,00:28:52.760,除了这些原因之外,,,
00:28:53.040,00:28:53.880,爆发的背后,,,
00:28:53.880,00:28:56.520,还有没有其他幕后力量在推动,00:28:52.425,00:28:56.720,"In addition, are there forces behind to
propel those color revolutions?"
00:28:56.520,00:28:57.640,然后一个地方,,,
00:28:57.640,00:28:59.760,它遇到了经济的社会的问题,00:28:56.840,00:28:59.595,"When economic and social issues arise in one place,"
00:28:59.760,00:29:02.120,是可以用自己因地制宜的方法来,00:28:59.600,00:29:02.300,"can they be resolved by measures
native to local dynamics,"
00:29:02.120,00:29:02.520,解决,,,
00:29:02.520,00:29:04.040,还是说可以偷个懒,00:29:02.300,00:29:05.660,"or by cutting corners to use measures directly copied
from western societies?"
00:29:04.080,00:29:06.000,直接向西方社会去取经,,,
00:29:06.000,00:29:07.240,去用1招百事,00:29:05.680,00:29:08.675,Is there a panacea for all the problems?
00:29:07.480,00:29:08.160,百灵的方法,,,
00:29:08.200,00:29:09.120,解决自己的问题,,,
00:29:09.160,00:29:11.560,我想赵老师已经给出了他的,00:29:08.675,00:29:11.545,I think Professor Zhang presented his opinions.
00:29:11.560,00:29:11.760,观点啊,,,
00:29:11.800,00:29:13.720,我们接下来也要通过对话一点点,00:29:11.545,00:29:14.900,Next let's hear your opinions through our Q&A session.
00:29:13.720,00:29:13.920,的,,,
00:29:13.960,00:29:15.120,来听到各位的观点,,,
00:29:15.160,00:29:16.080,在对话开始之前,,,
00:29:16.120,00:29:17.920,还是先来问一下,00:29:15.120,00:29:17.300,"Before we start our conversation,"
00:29:18.000,00:29:19.520,范老师的观点在哪里,00:29:17.320,00:29:19.640,"I would like to invite Professor Fan
to share his thoughts."
00:29:19.840,00:29:21.280,那么理解阿拉伯之春,,,
00:29:21.320,00:29:23.200,要放到国际政治的背景里边,00:29:19.640,00:29:23.280,"To understand the ""Arab Spring"", we need to put it
into an international political context."
00:29:23.200,00:29:23.920,冷战阶段,,,
00:29:23.920,00:29:25.920,美国它利用这些独裁政权,00:29:23.280,00:29:27.920,"During the Cold War, the U.S. used those dictatorships
to compete with the Soviet Union."
00:29:25.960,00:29:27.200,来和苏联进行竞争,,,
00:29:27.200,00:29:28.360,苏联解体之后,,,
00:29:28.360,00:29:29.440,你就发现,,,
00:29:29.440,00:29:30.640,这些独裁政权,00:29:28.140,00:29:32.200,"After the disintegration of Soviet Union, those dictatorships weren't obedient to the U.S."
00:29:30.640,00:29:32.440,在不需要美国的时候,,,
00:29:32.480,00:29:35.000,它其实有时候是未必言听计从的,00:29:32.200,00:29:34.780,when they didn't need help from it.
00:29:35.000,00:29:36.400,美国需要把它干掉,00:29:34.780,00:29:36.720,"Therefore, the U.S. needed to eliminate them."
00:29:36.400,00:29:37.240,而且这个时候,,,
00:29:37.280,00:29:38.440,美国因为在国际上,,,
00:29:38.440,00:29:39.880,没有主要的对手了,00:29:36.720,00:29:41.100,"At the same time, as it had no competitors
on the international stage,"
00:29:40.040,00:29:42.840,所以他希望采取一种低成本的,,,
00:29:42.840,00:29:43.200,方式,,,
00:29:43.200,00:29:45.720,我让你来搞代议制民主,00:29:41.100,00:29:46.380,"the U.S. wanted a low-cost approach,
which is representative democracy."
00:29:45.760,00:29:46.440,最好的办法,,,
00:29:46.440,00:29:48.200,因为代议制选举制度,,,
00:29:48.200,00:29:50.400,是最容易被外部力量操控的一种,00:29:46.600,00:29:50.740,"Representative democracy can easily
be manipulated by external forces."
00:29:50.400,00:29:50.760,制度,,,
00:29:50.760,00:29:52.120,然后搞得很成功,,,
00:29:52.120,00:29:52.920,第三波民主化,00:29:51.040,00:29:53.960,"It has been very successful, such as
the third wave of democratization,"
00:29:52.920,00:29:54.240,包括苏联东欧,,,
00:29:54.880,00:29:56.640,中亚的颜色革命,00:29:54.025,00:29:56.360,"including the color revolutions in Soviet Union,
Eastern Europe and Middle Asia,"
00:29:56.960,00:29:58.680,之后就是阿拉伯之春,00:29:56.680,00:29:58.620,"followed by ""Arab Spring""."
00:29:58.680,00:30:00.360,这个时候美国刚才张老师讲到,,,
00:30:00.400,00:30:01.280,一个很重要的点,00:29:58.860,00:30:03.020,"At this moment, as was explained by Professor Zhang,
some issues came up in America internally."
00:30:01.280,00:30:03.360,就是美国国内发生了问题,,,
00:30:03.360,00:30:05.520,它的不同资本集团的利益,00:30:03.140,00:30:06.800,The interests of different capital groups began to differ.
00:30:05.520,00:30:06.920,开始发生多元化,,,
00:30:07.000,00:30:08.520,然后深层国家,,,
00:30:08.560,00:30:10.440,或者叫金融军工,00:30:06.800,00:30:11.200,"The deep state, or the powers of the
financial industry and the military-industrial complex,"
00:30:10.440,00:30:11.480,这些集团的力量,,,
00:30:11.520,00:30:13.800,已经凌驾于美国国家利益之上,00:30:11.280,00:30:13.880,overrode the interest of the country.
00:30:13.920,00:30:14.600,美国有一个,,,
00:30:14.600,00:30:16.520,前驻沙特阿拉伯的大使,00:30:13.940,00:30:16.180,"A former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia,"
00:30:16.520,00:30:17.720,后来做过驻华公使,00:30:16.180,00:30:19.020,"Charles Freeman, who later served in China,"
00:30:17.720,00:30:18.760,叫傅利民,,,
00:30:18.760,00:30:19.960,他就说过一句话,,,
00:30:19.960,00:30:21.160,他说美国从,,,
00:30:21.200,00:30:22.080,2003年的,,,
00:30:22.080,00:30:23.360,伊拉克战争之后,00:30:19.020,00:30:27.920,"said America totally forgot its strategic
goals after the 2003 Iraq War."
00:30:23.640,00:30:24.840,就完全忘记了,,,
00:30:24.840,00:30:26.640,自己的战略目标是什么,,,
00:30:26.640,00:30:27.240,你知道,,,
00:30:27.240,00:30:28.120,所以你想一想,,,
00:30:28.160,00:30:29.040,从伊拉克战争,,,
00:30:29.040,00:30:29.640,阿富汗战争,00:30:28.040,00:30:30.975,"Think about it: from the Iraq War, Afghanistan War,
to the ""Arab Spring"","
00:30:29.640,00:30:31.160,一直到阿拉伯之争,,,
00:30:31.400,00:30:31.960,所有的东西,,,
00:30:31.960,00:30:33.560,其实对美国也没有好处,00:30:30.975,00:30:33.675,the U.S. didn't benefit from them.
00:30:33.560,00:30:34.920,导致的结果是什么,00:30:33.680,00:30:35.360,What's the result ?
00:30:34.920,00:30:35.720,在中东地区,,,
00:30:35.720,00:30:37.080,美国的敌人的敌人,00:30:35.360,00:30:38.760,"In Middle East, the enemy of America's enemy
is still America's enemy."
00:30:37.080,00:30:38.520,还是美国的敌人,,,
00:30:38.840,00:30:40.560,最后得利的只是美国国内的,,,
00:30:40.560,00:30:42.800,一小撮金融和军工,00:30:38.860,00:30:42.400,"Ultimately, only Wall Street, the military-industrial complex, and Big Oil benefited."
00:30:42.800,00:30:44.400,以及石油利益集团,00:30:42.520,00:30:44.260,This is a small group in the country.
00:30:44.840,00:30:46.320,所以在这样一个大背景下,,,
00:30:46.360,00:30:47.400,你想想那些阿拉伯国家,00:30:44.580,00:30:48.380,"Therefore, placed into this context,
the people in Arab countries are miserable."
00:30:47.400,00:30:48.480,其实也很痛苦的,,,
00:30:48.520,00:30:49.720,听完张老师的演讲,,,
00:30:49.720,00:30:51.720,我有两点比较受启发的,00:30:48.400,00:30:51.500,I am inspired by two things Professor Zhang mentioned.
00:30:51.960,00:30:53.840,一点就是张老师讲到,00:30:51.980,00:30:55.540,"One is Professor Zhang's quotation
of what Deng Xiaoping said,"
00:30:53.840,00:30:55.440,邓小平同志说过一句话,,,
00:30:55.640,00:30:58.120,听没听过枪声的视频是不一样的,00:30:55.785,00:30:58.845,"""The soldiers who heard the gunfire
are different than those who did not."""
00:30:58.240,00:30:59.400,其实还可以引申一点,,,
00:30:59.880,00:31:01.440,对于我们普通人来讲,00:30:58.845,00:31:00.920,Actually it can be extended that
00:31:01.440,00:31:02.520,听没听过枪声,00:31:00.920,00:31:03.180,it makes a difference for us ordinary people
00:31:02.520,00:31:04.640,或者你了不了解战争和动荡是,,,
00:31:04.640,00:31:05.360,什么样的,00:31:03.180,00:31:06.680,"whether you have heard the gunfire
and experienced wars and chaos."
00:31:05.440,00:31:06.360,也是不一样的,,,
00:31:06.400,00:31:07.640,我们这代人,,,
00:31:07.680,00:31:09.360,包括在座的很多年轻朋友,00:31:06.680,00:31:09.740,"My generation as well as some youngsters
here in the audience"
00:31:09.400,00:31:11.000,受到一些西方思想的影响,,,
00:31:11.120,00:31:13.200,觉得好像我喊一喊权利,00:31:09.745,00:31:12.600,may be influenced by some western ideologies -
00:31:13.200,00:31:14.760,我搞一搞社会运动,00:31:12.600,00:31:16.300,"thinking we can solve many problems by
calling for rights and starting social movements."
00:31:14.760,00:31:16.520,很多问题就可以解决,,,
00:31:16.560,00:31:18.160,但是其实孙子就说过一句话,00:31:16.300,00:31:18.600,"However, Sun Tzu once said,
[Chinese strategist around 500BC]"
00:31:18.160,00:31:19.960,说兵者存亡之地,,,
00:31:19.960,00:31:20.880,死生之道,00:31:18.600,00:31:21.500,"""Warfare concerns the lives of the people
and the survival of a country."""
00:31:20.880,00:31:22.440,其实政治也是一样的,,,
00:31:22.640,00:31:24.120,正直是会死人的,00:31:21.500,00:31:24.300,So does politics. Politics can also cause people to die.
00:31:24.760,00:31:26.640,那么如果我们意识不到,00:31:24.480,00:31:28.000,We will be easily influenced by an idealized illusion
00:31:26.640,00:31:28.080,政治生活的严峻性,,,
00:31:28.080,00:31:31.240,就很容易被一种理想化的这种,00:31:28.000,00:31:32.200,if we cannot realize the significance of political life.
00:31:31.240,00:31:31.920,幻想,,,
00:31:32.360,00:31:34.400,所影响带来的后果,,,
00:31:34.400,00:31:35.200,是非常严重的,00:31:33.320,00:31:36.620,This can bring serious consequences.
00:31:35.200,00:31:35.800,其实我觉得,,,
00:31:35.800,00:31:38.280,这是一个很重要的启发,00:31:36.705,00:31:39.065,This is an important inspiration.
00:31:38.480,00:31:40.720,那么第二个启发就是,00:31:39.065,00:31:41.300,"The second insight,"
00:31:40.720,00:31:42.040,张老师刚才也提到了,,,
00:31:42.640,00:31:44.160,埃及一些精英,00:31:41.300,00:31:43.520,"mentioned by Professor Zhang,"
00:31:44.160,00:31:45.880,和本国社会的脱节,00:31:43.520,00:31:46.540,"is the disjointedness between the
Egyptian elites and Egyptian people."
00:31:45.880,00:31:47.120,那么我也讲一个故事,,,
00:31:47.120,00:31:48.480,就是三年前,00:31:46.680,00:31:48.520,I will also share a story.
00:31:48.480,00:31:50.560,中国在肯尼亚修的,00:31:48.520,00:31:52.055,"Three years ago, when the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway built by China was completed in Kenya,"
00:31:50.560,00:31:52.200,蒙内铁路开通的时候,,,
00:31:52.200,00:31:55.280,我去当地参加开通仪式,00:31:52.055,00:31:55.085,"I attended the opening ceremony,"
00:31:55.400,00:31:57.560,跟当地的一些法学家,00:31:55.085,00:32:00.000,"and I ate and exchanged ideas with
local lawyers and the news media."
00:31:57.560,00:31:58.400,新闻媒体,,,
00:31:58.400,00:32:00.040,坐在一起吃饭交流,,,
00:32:00.640,00:32:04.320,他们那些人非常反对曼尼铁路,00:32:00.400,00:32:04.120,They opposed the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway strongly.
00:32:04.320,00:32:05.160,我在吃饭的时候,,,
00:32:05.160,00:32:06.480,我就吃得很好的海鲜,00:32:04.120,00:32:06.295,We were eating very good seafood.
00:32:06.560,00:32:09.080,我说蒙内铁路可以从蒙巴萨,00:32:06.295,00:32:08.865,And I said the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway
00:32:09.240,00:32:10.920,把海鲜运到内罗毕来,00:32:08.940,00:32:12.840,"can transport great seafood from Mombasa to Nairobi,
which can be enjoyed by the locals."
00:32:10.960,00:32:12.680,老百姓能吃到这样的东西,,,
00:32:13.160,00:32:14.240,法学家说了一句话,,,
00:32:14.240,00:32:15.360,让我大跌眼镜,,,
00:32:15.480,00:32:16.240,他竟然说,00:32:12.840,00:32:18.040,"Then the lawyer made my jaw drop,
asking me ""Why should locals eat this?"""
00:32:16.240,00:32:18.160,老百姓为什么要吃这样的东西呢,,,
00:32:19.080,00:32:20.440,这是我亲耳听到的,00:32:18.920,00:32:21.180,This is what I heard.
00:32:20.680,00:32:21.360,我才意识到,,,
00:32:21.360,00:32:22.280,在这些国家,,,
00:32:22.280,00:32:24.120,有一些这种精英阶层,00:32:21.300,00:32:26.040,"So I realized in those countries, these elites and some compradors -"
00:32:24.160,00:32:25.880,在西方受过良好教育的,,,
00:32:25.960,00:32:27.720,包括一些买办阶层,,,
00:32:28.200,00:32:28.880,国家的好坏,00:32:26.040,00:32:30.440,"they were educated well in the West,
but not interested in their country."
00:32:28.920,00:32:30.040,其实和他无关,,,
00:32:30.560,00:32:33.320,他的利益和国际的资本集团,00:32:30.440,00:32:34.780,Their interests are aligned with international capital groups.
00:32:33.320,00:32:34.920,是站在一起的,,,
00:32:35.200,00:32:36.560,所以这两个启发,00:32:35.060,00:32:37.780,"Hence, the two points are meaningful for"
00:32:36.560,00:32:37.880,对于我们今天的年轻人,,,
00:32:38.160,00:32:38.960,怎么去理解,,,
00:32:39.000,00:32:39.800,阿拉伯之声,00:32:37.920,00:32:41.100,"young generations to comprehend the ""Arab Spring"""
00:32:40.080,00:32:41.680,是非常有有意义的,,,
00:32:41.720,00:32:43.120,刚才两位教授讲到,00:32:41.600,00:32:44.080,Just now the two professors said that
00:32:44.360,00:32:46.120,搞政治不是请客吃饭,00:32:44.260,00:32:47.460,"politics is not a dinner party, but bleeding and sacrifice."
00:32:46.160,00:32:47.640,他是要流血牺牲的,,,
00:32:47.680,00:32:49.120,刚才两位教授也讲到,,,
00:32:49.720,00:32:51.200,包括西方媒体,00:32:47.460,00:32:54.580,"They also talked about the manipulation and
intervention of western media in Hong Kong recently."
00:32:51.200,00:32:52.320,在其中的操控,,,
00:32:52.320,00:32:54.480,和介入我们香港的问题,,,
00:32:54.480,00:32:55.880,你就能看到当地媒体,,,
00:32:55.920,00:32:57.600,西方媒体一拥而上的,00:32:54.680,00:32:58.280,"You can see the local media and western media swarmed to condemn the police,"
00:32:57.600,00:32:59.240,来谴责警察的暴力,,,
00:32:59.280,00:33:00.120,来煽风点火,00:32:58.360,00:33:01.445,"fanning hatred, and calming one side to provoke the other."
00:33:00.160,00:33:01.560,一边倒的拉偏架,,,
00:33:01.600,00:33:03.760,这就是一个很活生生的案例,00:33:01.445,00:33:03.580,This is a living example.
00:33:04.280,00:33:05.000,我们的对话,,,
00:33:05.000,00:33:06.000,马上就要开始了,00:33:03.940,00:33:06.720,Our conversation will now begin.
00:33:06.000,00:33:07.120,这边这位朋友,00:33:06.740,00:33:07.700,"Yes, please. Welcome."
00:33:07.400,00:33:08.520,欢迎有人说,,,
00:33:08.520,00:33:09.360,阿拉伯之春,,,
00:33:09.360,00:33:11.320,使欧盟面临了解体的边缘,00:33:07.700,00:33:11.520,"Some people say the ""Arab Spring"" put the EU
on the brink of disintegration."
00:33:11.320,00:33:12.720,那么它到底对欧盟,,,
00:33:12.720,00:33:13.280,以及欧洲,,,
00:33:13.280,00:33:15.360,产生了多大的影响呢,00:33:11.520,00:33:15.460,How much influence did it exert on Europe and EU ?
00:33:16.200,00:33:16.760,请坐,00:33:15.900,00:33:17.220,Please sit down.
00:33:16.760,00:33:18.760,观察的是革命对,00:33:17.220,00:33:19.600,The impact of this revolution on Europe.
00:33:18.880,00:33:19.720,欧洲的影响,,,
00:33:19.760,00:33:21.320,他已经产生了,,,
00:33:21.360,00:33:23.640,巨大的消极的影响,00:33:19.600,00:33:25.040,"It had huge negative repercussions
on European politics."
00:33:23.640,00:33:25.520,对整个欧洲的政治,,,
00:33:25.520,00:33:26.440,你可以发现,,,
00:33:26.920,00:33:27.960,今天,,,
00:33:27.960,00:33:29.520,欧洲内部的政治问题,00:33:25.040,00:33:33.520,"The most difficult problem in Europe is the
refugee issue - refugees from the Middle East."
00:33:29.560,00:33:30.840,最大问题就是,,,
00:33:30.880,00:33:32.880,中东产生的难民问题,,,
00:33:33.640,00:33:36.120,自从100多万难民涌入欧洲,00:33:33.600,00:33:36.820,"Over 1 million refugees flocked into Europe,"
00:33:36.120,00:33:37.000,之后,,,
00:33:37.080,00:33:38.920,现在还几百万在路上,00:33:37.000,00:33:40.260,and several million refugees are on their way.
00:33:39.560,00:33:42.280,所以欧洲是非常头疼,00:33:40.380,00:33:42.440,Europe really had a headache.
00:33:42.680,00:33:47.200,那么一个是欧盟现在已经分裂了,00:33:42.620,00:33:47.080,"On one hand, EU has already split up."
00:33:48.160,00:33:51.280,你像当初以人权的名义,00:33:48.400,00:33:53.400,"Those countries that supported the ""Arab Spring"" in the name of human rights and humanitarian intervention,"
00:33:51.280,00:33:52.680,人道主义干预的名义,,,
00:33:52.680,00:33:54.080,最积极自杀了,,,
00:33:54.080,00:33:56.200,不只是的英国法国这些国家,00:33:53.400,00:33:56.060,"like the U.K. and France,"
00:33:56.200,00:33:59.000,现在是最不愿意接受难民的,00:33:56.060,00:33:57.880,are the least willing to accept refugees.
00:33:59.360,00:34:02.080,然后中东欧国家是,00:33:58.600,00:34:00.900,Central and Eastern European countries
00:34:02.160,00:34:04.480,拒不执行欧盟的名额,00:34:01.000,00:34:04.800,"refused to implement the
Common European Asylum System."
00:34:04.520,00:34:07.360,分配欧盟想把难民,00:34:04.800,00:34:10.200,"The EU wants to distribute refugees
proportionally to every country."
00:34:08.240,00:34:09.040,谈一个比例,,,
00:34:09.080,00:34:10.640,每个国家都接受一点,,,
00:34:11.120,00:34:12.720,中东欧国家就全部说,00:34:10.520,00:34:14.000,"But almost all Central and Eastern European countries
refused to accept a single refugee,"
00:34:12.720,00:34:14.040,我们一个都不接受,,,
00:34:14.360,00:34:16.280,现在连丹麦什么都不接受,00:34:14.095,00:34:16.315,even Denmark refused now.
00:34:16.320,00:34:17.920,像希腊这样的国家,00:34:16.480,00:34:19.320,"Other countries, like Greece, asked for money"
00:34:17.960,00:34:19.920,就是你要给我钱,,,
00:34:19.960,00:34:21.040,给我他也缺钱,,,
00:34:21.200,00:34:21.640,对不对,,,
00:34:21.640,00:34:22.080,给我钱,,,
00:34:22.120,00:34:24.040,然后我做第一道防线,00:34:19.620,00:34:25.600,"to perform some temporary work
and build ""a frontline of defense""."
00:34:24.040,00:34:26.400,可以做一点临时性的工作,,,
00:34:26.520,00:34:28.240,所以欧盟已经分裂了,00:34:26.560,00:34:28.680,So the EU has actually already split up.
00:34:28.640,00:34:29.640,然后欧洲国家内部,,,
00:34:29.640,00:34:32.360,你发觉总体上右翼的势力,00:34:28.680,00:34:34.580,"Inside the European countries,
right-wing forces are visibly on the rise."
00:34:32.400,00:34:35.000,在明显的上升,,,
00:34:35.200,00:34:37.200,几乎都是国家都是这样的情况,00:34:34.580,00:34:37.080,This is actually happening in most countries.
00:34:37.240,00:34:39.160,但是我倒个人觉得,00:34:37.560,00:34:40.000,"But from my perspective,"
00:34:39.480,00:34:41.720,不至于使欧盟解体,00:34:40.000,00:34:43.240,the EU will not disintegrate because of this.
00:34:41.840,00:34:42.640,因为欧盟,,,
00:34:42.680,00:34:44.680,它还是发挥了一些重要作用,00:34:43.240,00:34:46.060,"The EU, with its huge market and unified currency,"
00:34:44.680,00:34:46.080,这么大的市场,,,
00:34:46.480,00:34:47.640,统一的欧元,00:34:46.060,00:34:47.760,still plays a major role
00:34:47.680,00:34:51.080,特别给年轻人看到一些机会等等,00:34:47.760,00:34:50.700,and offers opportunities for young people.
00:34:51.520,00:34:53.800,但是总体上欧盟的前景,00:34:51.415,00:34:54.255,"However, the overall prospect is becoming"
00:34:53.800,00:34:55.120,确实跟过去相比,,,
00:34:55.120,00:34:56.280,更加暗淡了,00:34:54.260,00:34:56.240,dimmer than before.
00:34:56.880,00:34:59.000,所以我记得我有一次我讲过的,00:34:56.760,00:34:59.180,"I remember that I said before, that in 30 years"
00:34:59.000,00:35:00.560,我说30年之后,00:34:59.180,00:35:01.380,China’s economic scale should be
00:35:00.560,00:35:01.760,中国经济规模,,,
00:35:01.760,00:35:04.600,应该是美国加欧盟的规模,00:35:01.380,00:35:06.300,"a combination of the United States
and the EU, if the EU still exists."
00:35:04.640,00:35:06.720,如果欧盟还存在的话,,,
00:35:07.360,00:35:09.400,张老师讲到中东欧国家,00:35:06.820,00:35:10.920,"Professor Zhang just said that Central
and Eastern European countries are not enthusiastic."
00:35:09.600,00:35:11.360,这个就不太热心这个事,,,
00:35:11.360,00:35:12.120,为什么呢,00:35:10.920,00:35:12.420,Why is this the case?
00:35:12.120,00:35:12.760,因为中东欧,,,
00:35:12.760,00:35:14.720,它毕竟离地中海稍微远一点,00:35:12.420,00:35:15.380,"It is because Central and Eastern European countries are
farther away from Mediterranean."
00:35:14.760,00:35:17.280,从阿拉伯地区到欧洲去,,,
00:35:17.280,00:35:18.440,通常是通过希腊,00:35:15.380,00:35:19.560,"People normally travel through Greece, Italy or Spain from the Middle East."
00:35:18.440,00:35:19.880,意大利或者西班牙,,,
00:35:19.920,00:35:21.440,那么那些中东欧国家他就愿意,00:35:19.560,00:35:23.060,"Central and Eastern European countries asked for more
money to fund protective measures."
00:35:21.440,00:35:22.360,所以你多拿钱,,,
00:35:22.360,00:35:23.600,你要拿钱来买平安,,,
00:35:23.600,00:35:24.040,对吧,,,
00:35:24.040,00:35:25.680,所以欧洲内部也发生很多分裂,00:35:23.060,00:35:25.440,So there are divisions inside Europe.
00:35:25.680,00:35:26.800,我打一个比方,00:35:25.620,00:35:27.560,Let me make an analogy.
00:35:26.920,00:35:28.840,假如说欧洲是一个锅,00:35:27.620,00:35:29.560,"If we say Europe is a pot,"
00:35:29.680,00:35:30.320,阿拉迪中,,,
00:35:30.320,00:35:31.320,阿拉伯地中海地区,00:35:29.560,00:35:32.540,the Arabian Mediterranean area is the stove underneath.
00:35:31.360,00:35:33.000,就是它下边炉子,,,
00:35:33.080,00:35:35.400,所以一直是有很密切的这种互动,00:35:33.280,00:35:36.380,They are closely connected.
00:35:35.400,00:35:35.880,关系,,,
00:35:35.880,00:35:37.520,欧洲人在历史上,,,
00:35:37.520,00:35:39.760,是特别怕地中海,00:35:36.380,00:35:39.720,"Historically, Europeans were very afraid that"
00:35:39.800,00:35:41.680,东岸南岸地区乱起来的,,,
00:35:41.720,00:35:43.200,会直接的烧到它,00:35:39.780,00:35:44.440,"the turmoil in the eastern and southern Mediterranean would ""burn towards"" the Europeans."
00:35:43.400,00:35:44.640,所以就可以理解,,,
00:35:44.680,00:35:47.000,为什么在2003年之前,00:35:44.680,00:35:48.520,"This explains why the U.S.-Europe relations
were good up to 2003"
00:35:47.120,00:35:48.480,美欧关系非常紧密,,,
00:35:48.720,00:35:50.320,但是为什么在2003年,,,
00:35:50.320,00:35:51.560,伊拉克战争的问题上,00:35:48.700,00:35:54.860,"but France and Germany literally broke up with America
on the Iraq War in 2003."
00:35:52.120,00:35:52.800,特别是法国,,,
00:35:52.800,00:35:54.640,德国跟美国就完全翻脸了,,,
00:35:54.680,00:35:55.240,为什么,,,
00:35:55.240,00:35:57.080,就相当于美国是一个熊孩子,,,
00:35:57.080,00:35:58.280,喜欢扔墨水瓶,00:35:54.940,00:36:00.680,"Why? The U.S. is like a spoiled child, throwing an
ink bottle at the pillow side of Europe"
00:35:58.400,00:35:59.360,但是扔在那个地方,,,
00:35:59.520,00:36:01.040,就是欧洲的枕头边,,,
00:36:01.240,00:36:02.680,肯定会见到我身上墨水,00:36:00.940,00:36:04.100,"and thus splashing ink onto Europe.
So Europeans were upset."
00:36:02.720,00:36:04.000,所以欧洲人很不甘心,,,
00:36:04.040,00:36:06.200,然后后来一个很重要的转折点,00:36:04.100,00:36:06.355,Then came a turning point.
00:36:06.240,00:36:07.840,就是法国利润,,,
00:36:08.040,00:36:10.640,政府都是非常保持独立性的,00:36:06.360,00:36:09.920,"Historically, all French governments were independent"
00:36:10.680,00:36:11.560,在地中海地区,,,
00:36:11.560,00:36:12.960,是要维持稳定秩序,00:36:09.920,00:36:13.460,and they maintained order in the Mediterranean.
00:36:13.720,00:36:15.720,为主要目标的萨科齐,00:36:13.460,00:36:16.160,"However, after [French President] Nicolas Sarkozy came in power,"
00:36:16.080,00:36:16.880,上台之后,,,
00:36:16.880,00:36:19.320,他当时为了自己的政治利益,00:36:16.160,00:36:20.680,he followed the U.S. for his own political interests.
00:36:19.320,00:36:21.080,所以一边倒的跟着美国走,,,
00:36:21.120,00:36:22.640,所以在干预利比亚,00:36:20.860,00:36:22.820,So he acted as a vanguard
00:36:22.640,00:36:24.000,干预地中海地区的,,,
00:36:24.040,00:36:25.040,这个过程里边,00:36:22.820,00:36:26.440,in intervening Libya and the Mediterranean.
00:36:25.040,00:36:26.120,当了急先锋,,,
00:36:26.320,00:36:28.320,结果导致地中海政治崩溃,00:36:26.440,00:36:29.160,This led to the political collapse of the Mediterranean
00:36:28.320,00:36:30.200,然后直接的影响到,,,
00:36:30.240,00:36:31.600,欧洲的安全秩序,00:36:29.160,00:36:31.660,and also impacted Europe's security and order.
00:36:31.720,00:36:32.880,所以我前几年,,,
00:36:32.880,00:36:34.040,在参加过一次,00:36:31.660,00:36:34.400,Several years ago I attended a conference
00:36:34.040,00:36:35.040,德国人组织的,,,
00:36:35.040,00:36:36.960,谈难民问题的一个会,00:36:34.400,00:36:37.040,"about the refugee crisis, which was
organized by a German."
00:36:37.040,00:36:38.160,当时我就一个观点,,,
00:36:38.160,00:36:39.800,我说其实你们不用开会,00:36:37.040,00:36:40.475,I had only one point - this conference was not necessary.
00:36:39.960,00:36:41.360,你们唯一要做的一件事,,,
00:36:41.360,00:36:42.600,就是回到地中海,00:36:40.480,00:36:43.100,"The only thing you should do is to go
back to the Mediterranean,"
00:36:42.600,00:36:43.280,叙利亚,,,
00:36:43.280,00:36:44.560,利比亚那些地区,,,
00:36:44.560,00:36:46.400,恢复当地的政治秩序,00:36:43.100,00:36:46.140,"including Syria and Libya, to restore political order."
00:36:46.680,00:36:47.960,什么问题都解决了,00:36:46.560,00:36:48.320,All problems will be solved.
00:36:49.040,00:36:50.840,只要当地的生活安定了,00:36:48.820,00:36:52.500,"As long as the local life is back in order,
people will not leave."
00:36:50.840,00:36:52.120,什么人都不往外走了,,,
00:36:52.360,00:36:54.320,因为大家都是想在自己的,,,
00:36:54.400,00:36:55.360,谁愿意远离,00:36:52.500,00:36:56.832,"- They all miss home.
- Yes, who likes leaving their home?"
00:36:55.400,00:36:57.320,固定背景离乡对吧,,,
00:36:57.400,00:36:59.120,我们再来看看这边有没有朋友,00:36:57.140,00:36:59.580,"Let's see if anyone in the audience here
would like to ask a question."
00:36:59.120,00:36:59.360,提问,,,
00:36:59.400,00:37:00.320,来欢迎这位,00:36:59.580,00:37:00.840,"Yes, please."
00:37:00.840,00:37:01.800,阿拉伯之春,,,
00:37:01.840,00:37:04.280,是阿拉伯世界追求民主,00:37:00.840,00:37:03.940,"The ""Arab Spring"" is a movement to pursue"
00:37:04.280,00:37:05.200,追求平等,,,
00:37:05.200,00:37:06.880,而发掀起的一场运动,00:37:03.965,00:37:06.645,equality and democracy in Arab world.
00:37:06.880,00:37:08.040,这也充分说明了,,,
00:37:08.040,00:37:09.840,全世界人民都是,00:37:06.645,00:37:12.240,"It well demonstrated that people around the world
long for equality and democracy."
00:37:09.880,00:37:10.960,热渴望,,,
00:37:10.960,00:37:12.800,民族渴望平等的,,,
00:37:13.080,00:37:15.240,然后我想问的问题是,,,
00:37:15.560,00:37:17.760,导致阿拉伯之冬的根本原因是,00:37:12.780,00:37:18.420,"My question is: what is the root cause
of the ""Arab Winter""?"
00:37:17.760,00:37:18.480,什么,,,
00:37:18.720,00:37:18.960,好,,,
00:37:18.960,00:37:19.440,请坐,,,
00:37:19.440,00:37:20.400,这个朋友的问题,00:37:18.720,00:37:20.200,"Sure, please be seated."
00:37:20.400,00:37:22.320,我觉得他第一个观点很有意思,00:37:20.200,00:37:22.360,His first point is very interesting.
00:37:22.320,00:37:23.520,他认为这个确实是,,,
00:37:23.520,00:37:24.000,当地人民,,,
00:37:24.000,00:37:25.440,追求民主的一项运动我们,00:37:22.360,00:37:25.720,"He thinks it's indeed a movement
for local people to pursue democracy."
00:37:25.440,00:37:26.720,大家怎么来看,00:37:25.720,00:37:27.180,What is your opinion?
00:37:27.240,00:37:28.640,呃阿拉伯地区,,,
00:37:28.920,00:37:32.560,老百姓去追求就业平等,00:37:27.260,00:37:36.900,"The demands by Arabs for jobs, equality,
a better life, and dignity,"
00:37:32.880,00:37:35.240,以及生活质量的提高,,,
00:37:35.240,00:37:36.960,尊人的尊严等等,,,
00:37:37.040,00:37:37.760,这些诉求,,,
00:37:37.760,00:37:39.400,是值得同情和认可的,00:37:37.180,00:37:39.520,are acceptable and understandable.
00:37:39.600,00:37:40.720,但是一定要注意,,,
00:37:40.720,00:37:41.200,就是,00:37:39.520,00:37:42.840,"However, political activities cannot go too far."
00:37:41.200,00:37:43.240,政治一定要讲究一个度,,,
00:37:43.600,00:37:45.400,你在追求这样一个目标的时候,00:37:43.180,00:37:46.215,"Specifically, when you are pursuing this goal,"
00:37:45.400,00:37:47.680,你要知道自己行为和后果之间的,,,
00:37:47.680,00:37:48.240,关系,00:37:46.220,00:37:49.400,you need to know what your actions can result in.
00:37:48.240,00:37:50.760,要知道我应该做到什么度为止,00:37:49.400,00:37:51.965,To what extent should you stop?
00:37:51.240,00:37:52.080,是不是,,,
00:37:52.600,00:37:54.160,把一切的政治秩序,00:37:51.965,00:37:55.220,Should you overturn the existing political system?
00:37:54.280,00:37:55.520,给颠覆掉了,,,
00:37:55.560,00:37:57.600,对我追求这个目标就有帮助,00:37:55.420,00:37:57.860,Is this helpful to your goal?
00:37:57.600,00:38:00.480,这是一个需要政治智慧的问题,00:37:57.860,00:38:00.420,You need political wisdom to think it through.
00:38:01.000,00:38:03.080,另外在这里边还要考虑到,00:38:01.080,00:38:06.200,"Besides, methods and means should also be considered."
00:38:04.200,00:38:05.520,这个手段和方法问题,,,
00:38:05.520,00:38:06.600,其实你会发现,,,
00:38:06.600,00:38:07.960,西方在这个问题上,,,
00:38:07.960,00:38:09.440,是非常双标的,00:38:06.340,00:38:09.640,Western countries hold double standards about this.
00:38:09.720,00:38:10.240,对吧,,,
00:38:10.280,00:38:12.560,你如果去了解美国的言论自由,,,
00:38:12.560,00:38:13.680,或者机会自由,00:38:09.980,00:38:16.400,"A lot of rules can be found regarding the right of free speech and freedom of assembly in the U.S.,"
00:38:13.720,00:38:15.000,它的条款里边,,,
00:38:15.040,00:38:16.760,有很多具体的规定,,,
00:38:16.760,00:38:17.520,比如说,00:38:16.400,00:38:17.940,"for example,"
00:38:17.560,00:38:18.320,美国有一条,,,
00:38:18.320,00:38:19.920,不能影响交通影响,00:38:18.100,00:38:21.720,"during the assembly, you cannot affect traffic.
Otherwise, you will be arrested."
00:38:19.960,00:38:20.320,交通,,,
00:38:20.320,00:38:20.920,马上逮捕,,,
00:38:20.920,00:38:21.800,二话不说,,,
00:38:21.800,00:38:23.280,所以你看在华尔街,00:38:22.020,00:38:24.505,"Whether it's Wall Street, New York, or Washington,"
00:38:23.280,00:38:24.680,在纽约华盛顿,,,
00:38:24.880,00:38:25.800,游行示威的时候,,,
00:38:25.800,00:38:26.480,警察一来,,,
00:38:26.520,00:38:27.200,所有的人,00:38:24.505,00:38:29.640,"all demonstrators will return to the curb
when the police come."
00:38:27.200,00:38:29.920,会退到人行道的道边石上,,,
00:38:30.320,00:38:32.080,它的规则是非常明确的,00:38:29.940,00:38:31.840,The rules are clear.
00:38:32.080,00:38:32.960,但是在香港,,,
00:38:33.160,00:38:34.400,西方人就不这么讲,00:38:31.840,00:38:34.735,"However, the west doesn't say so about Hong Kong."
00:38:34.400,00:38:36.160,所以这里边这里边有个陷阱,00:38:34.740,00:38:37.760,Here is the trick.
00:38:37.000,00:38:37.480,什么陷阱,,,
00:38:38.240,00:38:39.960,当你为了一些,,,
00:38:40.040,00:38:42.080,有合理性的诉求,00:38:38.000,00:38:43.740,"When you voice your opinions and reasonable demands,"
00:38:42.080,00:38:43.920,来发出自己的声音的时候,,,
00:38:43.920,00:38:46.680,你要防止被别人别有用心的利用,00:38:43.740,00:38:46.940,be aware of being manipulated by others.
00:38:48.320,00:38:49.400,我再补充一点,,,
00:38:49.480,00:38:53.080,实际上是美国学者汤廷顿讲的,00:38:47.880,00:38:52.920,"I want to add a point, from Samuel Phillips Huntington,
[American political scientist]"
00:38:53.840,00:38:54.960,我觉得站得住脚,00:38:53.180,00:38:55.720,which I think it's defensible.
00:38:54.960,00:38:56.080,他这个观点,,,
00:38:57.440,00:38:58.360,你发觉没有,00:38:56.135,00:38:59.175,Have you noticed the real problems
00:38:58.400,00:39:00.040,阿拉伯之春颜色革命,,,
00:39:00.080,00:39:01.360,都是一个什么问题,00:38:59.180,00:39:01.480,"of the ""Arab Spring"" and the color revolution?"
00:39:01.360,00:39:04.480,叫做政治参与爆炸,00:39:01.480,00:39:04.660,It's called political participation explosion.
00:39:06.120,00:39:07.520,旁听的讲这么一个观点,00:39:05.200,00:39:07.920,Huntington pointed out
00:39:07.520,00:39:10.440,就一方面是政治参与,00:39:08.400,00:39:10.100,political participation is one factor
00:39:10.440,00:39:12.680,一方面是体制建设,00:39:10.180,00:39:12.300,and institution building is another.
00:39:13.120,00:39:14.800,这两个如果不匹配的话,00:39:12.820,00:39:15.540,"If the two are not at the same level,"
00:39:15.280,00:39:17.400,如果政治参与率这么高,00:39:15.540,00:39:19.240,"for example, if political participation is high
and institution building is low,"
00:39:17.400,00:39:18.480,政治体制这么低,,,
00:39:19.600,00:39:21.720,动荡革命混乱,00:39:19.240,00:39:21.900,"it leads to unrest, revolution, and chaos."
00:39:22.400,00:39:24.120,这就阿拉伯之争最大的问题,00:39:22.560,00:39:24.400,That's the biggest problem.
00:39:24.480,00:39:26.480,所以这两个一定要相适应,00:39:24.400,00:39:26.920,The two factors must match
00:39:26.480,00:39:28.760,才能保持我们的有序的,00:39:27.085,00:39:29.400,to maintain an orderly political system.
00:39:28.960,00:39:29.680,政治,,,
00:39:29.720,00:39:31.680,否则就是失去就动乱,00:39:29.400,00:39:32.540,"Otherwise, it's disorder and unrest."
00:39:31.680,00:39:33.360,然后付出沉重的代价,,,
00:39:33.400,00:39:36.400,我老说千万就是不要有政治,00:39:32.760,00:39:38.260,"I always say, ""Don't be romantic about politics."""
00:39:36.400,00:39:37.520,浪漫主义,,,
00:39:37.560,00:39:39.800,甚至是一个要有高度的,,,
00:39:40.040,00:39:42.240,现实感和一种命运感,00:39:38.380,00:39:43.860,"Politics has a high sense of reality, destiny,
and responsibility to the country."
00:39:42.560,00:39:44.280,对国家的责任感,,,
00:39:45.000,00:39:45.880,你才能够主政,00:39:43.860,00:39:47.060,"Otherwise, you should not govern."
00:39:45.880,00:39:47.480,否则要出大问题的,,,
00:39:47.720,00:39:49.520,多少人被西方话语忽悠啊那,00:39:47.240,00:39:50.020,So many people are deceived by the westerner discourse.
00:39:49.560,00:39:50.560,你比方说民族,,,
00:39:50.600,00:39:51.680,我们热爱民族,00:39:50.020,00:39:52.060,"For example, democracy, we love democracy."
00:39:52.040,00:39:53.200,你把它具体化,,,
00:39:53.200,00:39:54.760,是什么样的民族,00:39:52.060,00:39:54.640,You have to be specific - what kind of democracy?
00:39:55.360,00:39:56.680,我们只有再来讨论,00:39:55.040,00:39:56.980,And then we can talk about it.
00:39:57.320,00:39:58.600,这样就好办了,00:39:57.020,00:40:00.025,"Is it the money-talk democracy like in the U.S.,"
00:39:58.600,00:40:00.080,要是美国这样的前族吗,,,
00:40:00.080,00:40:01.120,还是什么样的民族,,,
00:40:01.320,00:40:03.400,西方老师很抽象的概念,00:40:00.025,00:40:02.905,or something else? The West likes abstract concepts.
00:40:03.480,00:40:04.880,抽象也不是不能谈,00:40:03.140,00:40:04.740,Abstract concepts are fine.
00:40:04.880,00:40:06.480,你就直接问美国人,00:40:04.780,00:40:07.880,"For example, people around the world love peace,"
00:40:06.560,00:40:07.840,全世界都热爱和平,,,
00:40:07.880,00:40:09.760,我们把和平定为普世价值,00:40:07.880,00:40:10.920,"ask Americans if they are willing to
accept peace as a universal value?"
00:40:09.760,00:40:10.840,美国就不愿意,,,
00:40:11.760,00:40:14.000,美国要保留用武的权利,00:40:11.000,00:40:14.060,America chooses to reserve the right to use weapons.
00:40:14.480,00:40:17.240,中国人讲实践检验真理的唯一,00:40:14.240,00:40:17.900,"Chinese people say ""Practice is the only criterion to examine the truth."""
00:40:17.240,00:40:17.560,标准,,,
00:40:17.560,00:40:19.400,你可以有良好的愿望,00:40:17.900,00:40:20.280,"You can have many beautiful wishes,"
00:40:19.720,00:40:20.360,太多了唉,,,
00:40:20.360,00:40:22.400,但是一定要有一个,,,
00:40:22.760,00:40:25.840,符合自己民情国情的实现方法,00:40:20.285,00:40:25.080,"but you have to have a practical method
that is in line with national conditions."
00:40:25.920,00:40:26.960,否则的话,,,
00:40:26.960,00:40:28.560,很可能是良好的愿望,00:40:25.740,00:40:30.620,"Otherwise, the beautiful wishes may become heavy prices to pay."
00:40:28.600,00:40:31.160,最后带来很沉重的代价,,,
00:40:32.560,00:40:34.920,我们都说政治是一个非常严肃的,00:40:32.440,00:40:35.000,We say politics is a very serious topic.
00:40:34.920,00:40:35.200,话题,,,
00:40:35.200,00:40:37.000,他其实还是个非常高度的,00:40:35.000,00:40:38.700,"It is also highly professional, which"
00:40:37.040,00:40:38.360,专业性的一个话题,,,
00:40:38.720,00:40:39.600,光有理想,,,
00:40:39.600,00:40:40.880,光有浪漫是不够的,00:40:38.700,00:40:42.320,"requires practical ways to achieve,
instead of just romantic ambitions."
00:40:40.920,00:40:41.920,要有现实的实现,,,
00:40:41.960,00:40:43.200,路径,,,
00:40:43.440,00:40:46.480,不同观点可以互相讨论辩论,00:40:43.080,00:40:45.900,Different ideas can be discussed.
00:40:46.520,00:40:47.040,好,,,
00:40:47.240,00:40:48.600,我们全场最后一个问题,00:40:46.720,00:40:49.220,One last question. Welcome.
00:40:48.600,00:40:49.360,来欢迎,,,
00:40:49.800,00:40:50.800,我的问题就是,,,
00:40:50.800,00:40:52.920,今天怎么借助一带一路,00:40:49.495,00:40:52.635,My question is how to help these Arab countries
00:40:52.920,00:40:55.520,来帮助这些阿拉伯国家,00:40:52.635,00:40:55.415,"through the ""Belt and Road Initiative""?"
00:40:55.520,00:40:58.400,怎么样在他们的阿拉伯之冬当中,00:40:55.420,00:41:00.800,"How can we send our warmth continuously during their ""winter""?"
00:40:58.440,00:41:00.840,送去持续的温暖,00:41:00.900,00:41:03.160,"- Thank you.
- Thank you."
00:41:03.280,00:41:04.680,如何通过一带一路,00:41:03.160,00:41:06.040,"How to help these countries through
the ""Belt and Road Initiative""."
00:41:04.680,00:41:06.200,来帮助这些国家,,,
00:41:06.680,00:41:08.600,其实也不需要他来学习我们的,00:41:06.560,00:41:09.200,"Actually, they don't need to learn
our model of development."
00:41:08.600,00:41:09.280,模式,,,
00:41:09.480,00:41:11.240,有些很基础的东西,00:41:09.380,00:41:11.380,There are many fundamental things.
00:41:11.360,00:41:13.320,比如在西方的殖民体系,,,
00:41:13.360,00:41:15.120,和新殖民体系之下,00:41:11.560,00:41:15.200,"Under the western colonization system,
a third-world country can obtain"
00:41:15.120,00:41:17.280,它是可以给第三世界国家,,,
00:41:17.280,00:41:18.000,给你民主,00:41:15.200,00:41:20.560,"democracy, a legal system, a constitutional government,"
00:41:18.000,00:41:18.800,给你法制,,,
00:41:18.800,00:41:19.520,给你宪政,,,
00:41:19.560,00:41:20.520,给你很多东西,,,
00:41:20.560,00:41:21.440,跟言论自由,,,
00:41:21.440,00:41:22.240,多党竞争,00:41:20.560,00:41:23.540,"freedom of speech, multi-party competition,
and many other things."
00:41:22.240,00:41:23.200,唯独有两件东西,,,
00:41:23.200,00:41:23.800,它不给,,,
00:41:23.840,00:41:25.280,第一是基础设施,00:41:23.545,00:41:26.625,Except for two things - infrastructure and industrialization.
00:41:25.280,00:41:26.480,第二是工业化,,,
00:41:26.720,00:41:28.440,这两个东西是真正基础的,00:41:26.625,00:41:28.620,These two are fundamental.
00:41:28.440,00:41:30.240,包括从政治角度来讲,,,
00:41:30.240,00:41:32.200,政治建构如果没有基础设施,00:41:28.620,00:41:34.195,"Even from the perspective of politics, politics cannot
be built without infrastructure and industrialization."
00:41:32.240,00:41:33.000,没有工业化,,,
00:41:33.040,00:41:34.480,你政治是建立不起来的,,,
00:41:34.520,00:41:36.480,那么中国在一带一路沿线地区,00:41:34.195,00:41:37.295,"Through the ""Belt and Road Initiative"","
00:41:36.520,00:41:38.280,做的最重要最有功德的一件事,,,
00:41:38.320,00:41:39.080,就是第一,,,
00:41:39.120,00:41:40.200,我给你基础设施,00:41:37.300,00:41:41.220,"they benefited from China's assistance in
infrastructure and industrialization."
00:41:40.240,00:41:41.640,第二给你工业化,,,
00:41:41.680,00:41:43.760,我去过一带一路沿线的一些地方,00:41:41.220,00:41:43.525,"I have been to some areas along
the ""Belt and Road Initiative"","
00:41:43.760,00:41:45.840,看到当地基本上没有工作过的人,00:41:43.525,00:41:46.020,"and I saw populations who hadn't worked
for hundreds of years"
00:41:45.840,00:41:47.360,开始跑到工厂里面去上班,00:41:46.020,00:41:48.600,started working in factories and earning salaries.
00:41:47.360,00:41:48.040,拿工资了,,,
00:41:48.040,00:41:50.760,我觉得这就是一非常好的第一步,00:41:48.600,00:41:50.595,This is a great first step.
00:41:50.800,00:41:52.200,所以我在国外开会,00:41:50.595,00:41:53.585,"So I joked when I attended meetings overseas,"
00:41:52.200,00:41:53.840,我曾经开玩笑讲过,,,
00:41:53.840,00:41:55.920,我说你们美国人是死神,00:41:53.585,00:41:57.720,"that you Americans are the Grim Reaper,
throwing bombs everywhere you go,"
00:41:56.000,00:41:57.400,你们到哪都是扔炸弹,,,
00:41:57.440,00:41:59.080,我们中国人是财神,,,
00:41:59.080,00:42:01.040,我们到哪都带着大家一起发财,00:41:57.820,00:42:01.200,"and we Chinese are ""God of Wealth"",
bringing fortune everywhere we go."
00:42:01.040,00:42:02.040,当然这个是开玩笑,,,
00:42:02.040,00:42:03.040,但是实际上,,,
00:42:03.080,00:42:05.160,你想美国在历史上,00:42:01.200,00:42:05.840,"Though it is a joke, think about it: the U.S has started
more than 200 wars in history -"
00:42:05.400,00:42:06.520,发动过200多场战争,,,
00:42:06.560,00:42:08.320,但是不同的统计有的说法,00:42:05.840,00:42:07.635,statistics may be different.
00:42:08.320,00:42:08.600,认为,,,
00:42:08.600,00:42:09.280,美国历史上,00:42:07.635,00:42:10.780,Some people say the U.S. has only 17 years without wars in history.
00:42:09.280,00:42:10.840,只有17年没打过仗,,,
00:42:10.880,00:42:11.600,有人算过,,,
00:42:11.600,00:42:14.160,美国平均每天在地球上扔下多少,00:42:10.800,00:42:16.760,"Somebody calculated that everyday, the U.S.
throws a more than 10 bombs onto the earth."
00:42:14.200,00:42:15.520,大概十几颗炸弹,,,
00:42:16.080,00:42:18.200,然后有一个巴西学者叫班德拉,,,
00:42:18.240,00:42:18.800,统计过,00:42:16.780,00:42:19.865,"Bandeira, a Brazilian scholar, has counted"
00:42:18.800,00:42:20.000,美国在二战之后,,,
00:42:20.040,00:42:21.960,在地球上杀死了600多万人,00:42:19.865,00:42:22.845,"the U.S. killed more than 6 million people
after the Second World War."
00:42:22.160,00:42:23.960,那么你这样一个国家,,,
00:42:24.360,00:42:25.960,你给别人带来的是什么,00:42:22.845,00:42:25.980,What can such a country bring to others?
00:42:26.000,00:42:27.720,中国其实不需要他来学我的模式,00:42:25.980,00:42:27.720,China doesn't want to promote its model.
00:42:27.760,00:42:30.000,大家各过各的百花齐放,00:42:27.720,00:42:30.760,"We can go separate ways.
""Let all flowers bloom together."""
00:42:30.440,00:42:33.160,但基础设施和工业条件具备了,00:42:30.760,00:42:32.873,"However, all countries can be prosperous together"
00:42:33.160,00:42:33.680,之后,,,
00:42:33.680,00:42:34.880,大家可以一起繁荣,00:42:32.880,00:42:35.680,when equipped with infrastructure and industrial conditions.
00:42:34.880,00:42:37.560,可以变成一个互利共赢互补的,00:42:35.680,00:42:38.740,"We can build a mutually beneficial, win-win and
complementary global economy."
00:42:37.560,00:42:38.800,这样一个全球经济体,,,
00:42:38.880,00:42:40.360,这就是我们中央领导人提的,,,
00:42:40.360,00:42:42.480,叫人类命运共同体对,00:42:38.740,00:42:42.640,"That's what our leaders said,
""a community with a shared future for mankind""."
00:42:43.160,00:42:46.320,接着范守讲的战神和财神啊,00:42:42.640,00:42:45.980,"I want to continue with the topic,
God of War and God of Wealth."
00:42:46.680,00:42:47.720,你看,,,
00:42:47.800,00:42:50.880,当初美国发动这么多战争,00:42:46.700,00:42:49.900,The U.S. started so many wars.
00:42:50.880,00:42:51.680,最新的案例,,,
00:42:51.680,00:42:55.120,就是这个很有名的电话,00:42:50.880,00:42:54.080,The newest story is a famous call
00:42:55.440,00:42:56.600,特朗普,,,
00:42:56.640,00:42:58.360,打电话问卡特,00:42:54.080,00:43:00.460,"from Trump to Carter, ex-president in his 90s."
00:42:58.360,00:43:00.880,美国的90多岁的前总统,,,
00:43:01.160,00:43:04.000,说中国要超过我们了怎么办呢,00:43:01.020,00:43:03.720,"Trump asked, what do we do as China is taking us over?"
00:43:04.440,00:43:05.560,卡特就跟他讲了,00:43:03.920,00:43:05.500,Then Carter told thim that
00:43:05.560,00:43:05.800,说,,,
00:43:05.800,00:43:08.280,你看中国过去40年,00:43:05.520,00:43:07.360,over the past 40 years
00:43:08.320,00:43:09.880,没有发动任何战争,00:43:07.360,00:43:10.000,China hasn't started any wars
00:43:09.920,00:43:10.560,没有打仗,,,
00:43:10.560,00:43:12.080,我们过去200多年,00:43:10.220,00:43:12.860,while we have been in wars during the past 200 years.
00:43:12.080,00:43:13.080,一直在打仗,,,
00:43:14.040,00:43:16.200,所以就造成了这样的问题,00:43:13.960,00:43:16.880,That's why we are in this situation.
00:43:16.200,00:43:17.960,他说我们只要拿出1万亿,,,
00:43:17.960,00:43:20.120,我们就有世界一流的基础设施,00:43:16.885,00:43:19.415,"We can have the best infrastructure
if we invest one trillion."
00:43:20.280,00:43:22.440,我们就浪费了3万亿去打仗,00:43:19.800,00:43:23.580,"However, we wasted three trillions to
wage wars, which is a huge mistake."
00:43:22.520,00:43:24.280,犯了巨大的错误,,,
00:43:24.400,00:43:28.320,实际上首先一个国家的发展,00:43:24.340,00:43:29.940,"Actually, the development and
modernization of a country"
00:43:28.360,00:43:30.000,一个国家的现代化,,,
00:43:30.360,00:43:31.000,本质上要,,,
00:43:31.040,00:43:33.080,靠这个国家自己的,00:43:30.180,00:43:33.500,essentially depends on its own people.
00:43:33.120,00:43:34.280,人民,,,
00:43:34.320,00:43:36.120,找到一条正确的道路,00:43:34.240,00:43:38.360,"They need to find their own path.
This is the key."
00:43:36.960,00:43:38.840,这是最关键的,,,
00:43:38.880,00:43:40.880,但是中国是可以做一些帮助的,00:43:38.880,00:43:41.280,China can offer some help on this.
00:43:41.000,00:43:42.720,我们在苏伊士运河边上,,,
00:43:42.720,00:43:45.840,那里搞了一个发展园区,00:43:41.680,00:43:48.640,"Tianjin helped to build a development
 park along the Suez Canal"
00:43:45.920,00:43:47.600,他天津帮他们做的,,,
00:43:47.720,00:43:49.280,总体还是比较成功的,,,
00:43:49.840,00:43:53.280,其中就是呃有一个玻璃纤维的,00:43:48.740,00:43:54.020,"and a glass fiber manufacturing
enterprise became pretty successful."
00:43:53.280,00:43:54.240,企业,,,
00:43:54.400,00:43:55.760,从浙江,,,
00:43:55.800,00:44:00.520,整个的就是投资在园区里做,00:43:54.440,00:44:00.180,This enterprise received investment from Zhejiang and manufacturing takes place in the development park.
00:44:00.760,00:44:02.240,现实玻璃纤维,00:44:00.580,00:44:02.160,"Now in terms of glass fiber,"
00:44:02.520,00:44:04.040,中国是第一大生产国,00:44:02.260,00:44:05.040,"China is the largest producer,"
00:44:04.040,00:44:05.440,美国大概第二大,,,
00:44:05.520,00:44:06.720,埃及变成第三大,,,
00:44:06.760,00:44:08.120,就靠这一个企业,00:44:05.255,00:44:08.355,"the U.S. is the second, and Egypt is the third,
only through this one enterprise."
00:44:08.560,00:44:10.000,他创造了很多就业,00:44:08.360,00:44:10.860,It generates lots of jobs and pays taxes.
00:44:10.000,00:44:11.400,交了很多税收,,,
00:44:11.600,00:44:12.920,但是对于这样1个,00:44:11.260,00:44:14.340,"Nevertheless, for a large country with a
population of nearly 100 million,"
00:44:12.960,00:44:14.440,将近1亿人的大国,,,
00:44:14.480,00:44:16.480,你即使有10个这样的项目,00:44:14.435,00:44:17.505,"issues cannot all be solved with even
10 projects like this."
00:44:16.480,00:44:18.320,也解决不了很多问题,,,
00:44:18.560,00:44:20.120,本质上还是要靠这个国家,00:44:18.220,00:44:21.700,"Essentially, it relies on the country itself
to find the right path of development"
00:44:20.120,00:44:22.480,根据自己的民情国情,,,
00:44:22.480,00:44:24.120,找出正确的发展道路,00:44:21.700,00:44:24.740,based on its conditions of people and the country.
00:44:24.360,00:44:25.240,最难的地方,,,
00:44:25.240,00:44:26.480,我当时跟福山辩论,00:44:24.940,00:44:27.700,"When I debated Fukuyama,"
00:44:26.480,00:44:27.240,我还有一句话,,,
00:44:27.240,00:44:28.480,我说为什么,,,
00:44:28.520,00:44:29.920,我说变成阿拉伯之都,00:44:27.780,00:44:29.740,"I said the reason it turned into an ""Arab Winter"""
00:44:29.920,00:44:31.280,我说那个地区,,,
00:44:31.320,00:44:32.520,还没有成熟到,,,
00:44:32.560,00:44:34.480,中国的辛亥革命时期,00:44:29.740,00:44:35.420,is because the people's political awareness is not as high as China during Xinhai Revolution [which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty]
00:44:35.040,00:44:36.040,我是这样讲,00:44:35.480,00:44:36.640,That's what I said.
00:44:36.800,00:44:38.200,所以有时候没有办法的,00:44:36.640,00:44:38.540,Sometimes there is nothing they can do about it.
00:44:38.200,00:44:39.600,就是你要自己碰,,,
00:44:39.600,00:44:40.840,经过很多挫折,00:44:38.540,00:44:42.980,"You have to try your luck, experience setbacks, and
eventually find the path to success."
00:44:40.840,00:44:43.160,最后再找到一条成功的道路,,,
00:44:43.840,00:44:45.520,有时候历史是很残酷,00:44:43.660,00:44:45.540,Sometimes history is cruel.
00:44:47.560,00:44:49.480,你看刚才最后一位朋友问的时候,00:44:47.580,00:44:50.420,The last question is what we can do.
00:44:49.480,00:44:50.960,我们可以做些什么,,,
00:44:51.080,00:44:52.800,大家都说到了一带一路,00:44:50.420,00:44:52.500,"And we talked about the Belt and Road Initiative,"
00:44:52.840,00:44:54.200,一带一路里面有5个通,00:44:52.500,00:44:53.960,which includes five links:
00:44:54.240,00:44:54.840,大家都知道,,,
00:44:54.840,00:44:56.640,其中比如说像政策沟通,00:44:53.960,00:44:57.480,"policy coordination, facility connectivity,"
00:44:56.800,00:44:57.480,设施联通,,,
00:44:57.520,00:44:58.920,其中还有1个非常重要的,,,
00:44:58.920,00:44:59.440,就是,00:44:57.480,00:45:00.520,"and the very important one,
people-to-people bonds."
00:45:00.280,00:45:01.600,我觉得民心相通,,,
00:45:01.600,00:45:04.240,就是你真正的去理解一个国家,00:45:00.520,00:45:06.860,"These bonds are to truly understand, respect, and
acknowledge the people in an area and nation."
00:45:04.280,00:45:05.200,一个地区的人民,,,
00:45:05.200,00:45:06.200,去尊重他们,,,
00:45:06.200,00:45:07.480,去认知他们,,,
00:45:07.520,00:45:08.840,刚才我们来剖析,,,
00:45:08.840,00:45:09.560,阿拉伯之春,00:45:07.220,00:45:10.580,"When we analyzed how the ""Arab Spring""
turned into the ""Arab Winter""."
00:45:09.560,00:45:11.160,怎么会变成阿拉伯之冬,,,
00:45:11.200,00:45:13.120,并不只是把它当成一个遥远的,00:45:10.580,00:45:13.040,"we don't just regarded it as a distant event,"
00:45:13.120,00:45:13.680,案例,,,
00:45:13.720,00:45:15.920,并不只是说看了这个模式,00:45:13.040,00:45:18.680,but rather reflect on ourselves not to fall into this trap.
00:45:15.920,00:45:17.200,我们来反观自己,,,
00:45:17.200,00:45:18.600,不要陷入这样的陷阱,,,
00:45:18.600,00:45:19.800,我觉得除此之外,,,
00:45:19.800,00:45:20.720,还有一层意思,00:45:18.740,00:45:21.820,We need to see beyond that
00:45:20.760,00:45:21.000,就是,,,
00:45:21.000,00:45:23.440,真正的人类命运共同体的建设,00:45:21.820,00:45:24.740,and build our community with a shared future.
00:45:23.760,00:45:25.680,在拉着大家一起往前走的时候,,,
00:45:25.720,00:45:27.120,我们还能多做些什么,00:45:24.740,00:45:28.480,"What else can we do and what more help
can we offer when we go forward together?"
00:45:27.240,00:45:28.640,还可以帮到别人什么,,,
00:45:28.680,00:45:30.320,我想这个可能是给我们最大的,00:45:28.480,00:45:30.580,This might be our biggest inspiration.
00:45:30.320,00:45:30.920,启发,,,
00:45:30.920,00:45:31.200,好,,,
