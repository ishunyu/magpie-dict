00:00:00.990,00:00:03.990,中国已经聚集到今天这个地步,00:00:01.000,00:00:06.420,"China has risen up, and we can't avoid any questions or doubts."
00:00:03.991,00:00:06.690,我们什么问题都不能回避了,,,
00:00:06.691,00:00:08.850,这个国家的历史到底是怎样,,,
00:00:08.851,00:00:12.120,随着时代的发展又是会产生怎样的矛盾,00:00:06.600,00:00:11.800,"What should they know about the history of China?
What conflicts will emerge as time moves on?"
00:00:12.121,00:00:16.860,我是希望唤醒每月对我们自己一直都不回台湾,00:00:12.160,00:00:16.400,I hope to awake all the Chinese people about our own system.
00:00:16.861,00:00:18.450,问题是早点同意好呢,00:00:16.720,00:00:19.200,Is it better to unify Taiwan sooner or later?
00:00:18.451,00:00:20.700,还是管理学生成绩的背后呢,,,
00:00:20.701,00:00:21.870,就是不断的补课,00:00:19.200,00:00:23.200,"Students have endless tutoring sessions after school
for better grades. How do you interpret this?"
00:00:21.871,00:00:23.550,如何解读这个现象,,,
00:00:23.551,00:00:25.620,这就是中国青,,,
00:00:25.621,00:00:26.580,张维迎说,,,
00:00:33.090,00:00:34.950,中国解决了挨打的问题,00:00:32.900,00:00:36.200,China successfully fought the intruders and became self-sufficient.
00:00:34.951,00:00:36.360,解决了挨饿的问题,,,
00:00:36.361,00:00:39.150,现在当务之急要解决挨骂挨骂的问题,00:00:36.380,00:00:38.840,But we still face unfair criticisms.
00:00:39.151,00:00:43.230,中国人讲好中国故事最根源到底在哪,00:00:39.200,00:00:42.800,What is the root cause of our inability to tell the stories of China?
00:00:43.231,00:00:45.720,要讲的太多可能无从讲起,00:00:42.880,00:00:45.440,Perhaps we have so much to tell and don't know where to begin.
00:00:45.721,00:00:48.180,最初的一个问题在于没有自信,00:00:45.600,00:00:47.880,"At first, it was the lack of confidence."
00:00:48.181,00:00:53.910,现在自信有了对外沟通的过程中会发现类似就像这个商标一样,00:00:48.100,00:00:51.440,"Now, we have the confidence but we realize that"
00:00:53.911,00:00:55.380,专利权注册全一样,00:00:51.920,00:00:55.200,"just like how trademarks and patents can be registered,"
00:00:55.381,00:00:58.830,有些词已经被人注册向民主,00:00:55.440,00:00:57.600,some words have already been registered.
00:00:58.831,00:00:59.760,法治,00:00:57.820,00:01:00.600,"Such as ""democracy"", ""rule of law"", and ""human rights""."
00:00:59.761,00:01:03.120,人权好像我们说的民主法治人权就不是民主,00:01:00.720,00:01:04.800,"It seems that our  ""democracy"", ""rule of law""
and ""human rights"" don't match their definitions."
00:01:03.121,00:01:03.420,法治,,,
00:01:03.421,00:01:03.960,人权一样,,,
00:01:03.961,00:01:05.070,只有他说的是,,,
00:01:05.071,00:01:06.960,这个东西就很奇怪了,00:01:05.100,00:01:06.700,That's so strange.
00:01:06.961,00:01:09.660,我们怎么才能够平等地使用这个词,00:01:06.980,00:01:09.200,How could we use these terms equally?
00:01:09.661,00:01:10.500,这个就是话语权,,,
00:01:10.501,00:01:10.980,那种,00:01:09.660,00:01:11.360,Having our right of speech is important.
00:01:10.981,00:01:12.750,从二十世纪开始,00:01:11.520,00:01:14.060,"Since the 20th century, especially in the first half of it,"
00:01:12.751,00:01:14.250,尤其是前半叶,00:01:14.280,00:01:15.560,China had no say internationally.
00:01:14.251,00:01:17.460,中国过得挺憋屈的你那个时候你除了被迫接受,00:01:15.760,00:01:18.380,"At that time, China had no choice but to passively accept things."
00:01:17.461,00:01:18.690,也没什么更好的选择,,,
00:01:18.691,00:01:21.180,那你现在有能力却跟他对抗,00:01:18.600,00:01:22.540,"Now, we are able to compete with these concepts"
00:01:21.181,00:01:22.740,这个这些代练的时候,,,
00:01:22.741,00:01:26.220,你会发现你吃了开始的亏向民主这样的词汇,00:01:22.860,00:01:24.500,but we find ourselves at a disadvantage.
00:01:26.221,00:01:27.510,其实我们就吃了大亏,00:01:24.640,00:01:27.220,"Especially for words like ""democracy""."
00:01:27.511,00:01:33.330,关键的问题对于民主的这种定义允不允许我们丰富它的概念,00:01:27.660,00:01:33.200,"The key question is whether we have the right
to enrich the definition of ""democracy""."
00:01:33.331,00:01:35.430,中国走的就像民主的道路,00:01:33.400,00:01:36.220,"China is on a democratic path.
What we have is democracy."
00:01:35.431,00:01:36.660,我们现在就是民主,,,
00:01:36.661,00:01:39.630,不能说你说我不是民主这个词我就不用了,00:01:36.780,00:01:40.400,"We won't stop using the word ""democracy"" because they say it's not."
00:01:39.631,00:01:41.010,那咋成了请你看,,,
00:01:41.011,00:01:42.030,包括像我们外交部,,,
00:01:42.031,00:01:44.130,还有其他的这种这种发言的渠道,00:01:40.680,00:01:46.200,"In fact, many information channels, such as Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, have always been explaining."
00:01:44.131,00:01:46.350,我们也一直在做一些解释工作,,,
00:01:46.351,00:01:47.850,要有官方语言,00:01:46.400,00:01:49.100,"We not only need the official channels, but also the folk channels."
00:01:47.851,00:01:53.100,还要有民间的对我外甥女的她去台湾念大学,00:01:49.320,00:01:52.380,My niece went to a university in Taiwan.
00:01:53.101,00:01:58.470,在大学里头跟一个哲学的老师讨论这个大陆跟台湾发展的对比,00:01:52.680,00:01:57.960,"She discussed with a philosophy professor
to compare Taiwan and the mainland."
00:01:58.471,00:01:58.710,最后,,,
00:01:58.711,00:01:59.940,这个老师突然间炮声,00:01:58.580,00:02:01.220,"Finally, the professor played what he
thought would be a ""trump card""."
00:01:59.941,00:02:01.320,他觉得是杀手锏,,,
00:02:01.321,00:02:02.880,你们没有民主啊,00:02:01.460,00:02:04.000,"""You don't have democracy. You don't have elections."""
00:02:02.881,00:02:04.320,因为没有选举,,,
00:02:04.321,00:02:07.080,你什么都可能比台湾地区号大陆没有选取,00:02:04.240,00:02:06.920,"""The mainland might be better in many ways,
but it doesn't have elections."""
00:02:07.081,00:02:09.300,那不就是那个一说什么都是必备猴的,00:02:07.000,00:02:09.400,Every time they want you to shut your mouth.
00:02:09.301,00:02:10.290,对然后呢,,,
00:02:10.291,00:02:12.000,我外甥女淡淡的回了一句,00:02:09.540,00:02:12.620,"And my niece replied calmly,"
00:02:12.001,00:02:12.840,他说,00:02:12.740,00:02:15.800,"""Yes, you have elections.
But can you elect a president like Xi Jinping?"""
00:02:12.841,00:02:20.820,你有选举你能选出来习近平好的企业是创造好产品最厉害的企业是创造标准,00:02:16.180,00:02:18.400,Good companies makes good products.
,,,00:02:18.600,00:02:20.800,The best companies make the standards.
00:02:20.821,00:02:25.410,那么你如果能够先率先的提出一种合理化的新的标准,00:02:20.900,00:02:26.500,"So, if you can establish new and reasonable standards,
your will hold your ground."
00:02:25.411,00:02:26.820,你也就站住脚了,,,
00:02:26.821,00:02:27.750,现在就是话语权,,,
00:02:27.751,00:02:28.470,这个角度来讲,,,
00:02:28.471,00:02:29.400,包括价值观等等,,,
00:02:29.401,00:02:31.350,那么这个的的标准,00:02:26.980,00:02:33.580,"I think it's time to reshape the standards
for values and political voices."
00:02:31.351,00:02:35.700,我觉得四十红将军最好的重新塑造了中国共产党的优势,,,
00:02:35.701,00:02:36.450,就在这里,00:02:34.560,00:02:36.520,The Communist Party of China [CCP] has an advantage.
00:02:36.451,00:02:38.310,他会勇于的做出改变,00:02:36.780,00:02:39.020,CCP has the courage to reform instead of fearing it.
00:02:38.311,00:02:39.450,而不是惧怕,,,
00:02:39.451,00:02:42.180,怕你见过这块这个思维的这个顾虑也很强,00:02:39.400,00:02:42.000,It is also strong in constructing China's own language.
00:02:42.181,00:02:43.650,就是我有改观的意识,00:02:42.180,00:02:43.880,The CPC is consciously making reforms.
00:02:43.651,00:02:44.760,有看过去几年里,,,
00:02:44.761,00:02:46.500,有几个大神已经做得非常好,00:02:44.000,00:02:46.380,"In the past few years, several big
programs were very successful."
00:02:46.501,00:02:48.480,尤其是这个世界中,00:02:46.600,00:02:48.580,"Especially the CPC in Dialogue with World
Political Parties High-Level Meeting."
00:02:48.481,00:02:52.290,中国共产党如果全是在政党加强站内的交流的时候,00:02:48.600,00:02:54.020,"When the CPC increase exchange with other parties in
the world, it will enhance their understanding about us."
00:02:52.291,00:02:54.450,他就会增进对你的了解,,,
00:02:54.451,00:02:56.430,中国是究竟是一个爱好和平的国家,00:02:54.300,00:02:58.560,"Is China a true lover of peace, or a country
like some western media reported?"
00:02:56.431,00:02:59.040,还是某些西方魔气就抹黑你的东西,,,
00:02:59.041,00:02:59.580,这点上,,,
00:02:59.581,00:03:02.730,我觉得全世界的这个人民的眼睛也是雪亮,00:02:59.180,00:03:02.680,I believe everyone in the world can see with their own eyes.
00:03:02.731,00:03:04.440,在跟别人在介绍中国的时候,,,
00:03:04.441,00:03:07.020,并不是说只有我说的才是对的,00:03:02.860,00:03:06.780,"When we talk about China to other countries,
we are not saying ""Only what I say is right""."
00:03:07.021,00:03:09.420,其实我是鼓励大家一起来讨论,00:03:06.960,00:03:10.860,"We hope to initiate discussions
and hear each other's opinions."
00:03:09.421,00:03:13.050,你不妨听听我的观点对然后我还可以告诉你,,,
00:03:13.051,00:03:15.660,按你自己这个逻辑再讨论下去的话,00:03:11.360,00:03:17.720,"And I can tell you that if you follow your logic,
you can't explain the problems you will face."
00:03:15.661,00:03:18.180,你遇到的困境里没法解释,,,
00:03:18.181,00:03:21.180,我觉得这也是我们特别期待从张老师那里听到的,00:03:18.280,00:03:21.460,That's also what we expect to hear from Professor Zhang.
00:03:31.650,00:03:34.350,我们这期录那个把中国的事说清楚,00:03:31.600,00:03:35.500,"In this episode, we mainly talk about making China's voice heard."
00:03:34.351,00:03:37.110,主要有中国话语对对对这样子的话,00:03:35.840,00:03:37.100,"Yes, China's voice."
00:03:37.111,00:03:39.570,正是竟然在场合就是国际场合,,,
00:03:39.571,00:03:41.460,是我觉得我看几次大的活动,00:03:37.240,00:03:44.140,"Professor Zhang, you have attended some
major international debates with western scholars."
00:03:41.461,00:03:45.000,跟西方式的辩论真的特别理性,00:03:44.940,00:03:47.040,The debates help both sides introspect.
00:03:45.001,00:03:51.120,大家会去思考望月反思就是国内一些论坛上会有这种国内的学生会之间来讲,00:03:47.360,00:03:50.680,Do domestic scholars challenge you as well?
00:03:51.121,00:03:54.120,国内现在就是没有行政机器中关联,00:03:51.000,00:03:53.400,"Domestically, we don't have such an atmosphere."
00:03:54.121,00:03:55.080,他不愿意在一起,00:03:53.580,00:03:55.780,People with different opinions are unwilling to debate each other.
00:03:55.081,00:03:57.180,节目肯定不老说嘛,00:03:56.000,00:03:59.800,"(An economist) Chen Ping always says that
he can't find someone to debate with"
00:03:57.181,00:04:02.970,这名字找不到队就咱以前发这个贴各大擂台愿意打啊,00:04:00.040,00:04:02.680,although he keeps posting online.
00:04:02.971,00:04:07.290,我们本来想找一些对张老师质疑的,00:04:03.060,00:04:08.200,"We tried to invite people who disagree with you
or who want to challenge you in the live audience."
00:04:07.291,00:04:10.590,就来挑战的是不是特别欢迎来这些,00:04:08.620,00:04:10.080,They are especially welcome.
00:04:10.591,00:04:11.970,你应该质疑我们观念,,,
00:04:11.971,00:04:16.500,往往他不是有一定影响力的学者公开来给你解闷,00:04:10.200,00:04:15.720,"Now, people who challenge us are usually not influential scholars."
00:04:16.501,00:04:17.760,网络平台机会,00:04:16.240,00:04:19.180,"Mainly, the Internet offers them channels to to heard."
00:04:17.761,00:04:21.630,你看到的一个发生的这个传说给他背过身子,00:04:19.180,00:04:21.400,There are groups working behind them
00:04:21.631,00:04:22.650,其实什么角色,00:04:21.400,00:04:25.220,"but the composition and background of
the groups are unclear. Not just researchers."
00:04:25.350,00:04:27.210,各位家长们不要像上场了啊,00:04:25.220,00:04:27.440,"- Hello everyone, it's time for the show.
- Okay, let's go."

00:04:27.211,00:04:27.510,呵呵,,,
00:04:36.570,00:04:38.010,大家好欢迎大家来到,,,
00:04:38.011,00:04:39.840,这就是中国节目的现场,00:04:36.400,00:04:39.700,"Hello everyone, welcome to China Now."
00:04:39.841,00:04:42.060,我们将会在这里一起来认识中国,00:04:39.960,00:04:43.960,We are here learn about China and understand China!
00:04:42.061,00:04:46.350,读懂中国也理解中国在我身边的是我们节目的主嘉宾,00:04:44.560,00:04:46.421,"Standing next to me is our keynote speaker,"
00:04:46.351,00:04:50.010,复旦大学中国研究院的院长张维为教授欢迎,00:04:46.421,00:04:50.100,"Professor Zhang Weiwei, Director of the
China Institute of Fudan University. Welcome!"
00:04:54.000,00:04:54.570,在现场,,,
00:04:54.571,00:04:56.100,还有很多亲爱的观众,,,
00:04:56.101,00:04:57.720,朋友们也有我们的变迁,00:04:53.920,00:04:58.660,"There are many people in the audience
today, including our pre-production panel."
00:04:57.721,00:04:58.770,会小组的成员,,,
00:04:58.771,00:04:59.820,我们也特别期待,,,
00:04:59.821,00:05:02.190,等一下你跟赵老师之间的对话,00:04:58.800,00:05:02.000,We look forward to your dialogue with Professor Zhang.
00:05:02.191,00:05:03.090,那按照惯例呢,,,
00:05:03.091,00:05:04.620,我们之前还是会紧张的,00:05:02.240,00:05:05.880,We will begin with the keynote speech by Professor Zhang.
00:05:04.621,00:05:06.060,是做一段主旨演讲,,,
00:05:06.061,00:05:08.610,所以我现在先把时间交给你,00:05:06.000,00:05:09.000,"Now, I will give the stage to Professor Zhang. Please."
00:05:08.611,00:05:08.970,有请,,,
00:05:13.470,00:05:15.270,最近大家可能注意到,,,
00:05:15.271,00:05:19.470,关于高铁的这个个猪肝好新闻特别多,00:05:13.440,00:05:18.760,"Recently, you may have notice lots of good news about high-speed rail."
00:05:19.471,00:05:26.490,那我看不久前我们国务院通过了一个八纵八横的这个高铁规划,00:05:19.200,00:05:26.000,"Not long ago, the State Council passed the plan of
the ""eight vertical and eight horizontal"" network."
00:05:26.491,00:05:31.620,高铁里程之家现在已经占到世界的三分之二,00:05:26.200,00:05:30.800,Our high-speed rail mileage now accounts for two-thirds of the world’s.
00:05:31.621,00:05:34.260,那么下一步还要发展,00:05:31.620,00:05:33.720,We will make more progress from there.
00:05:34.261,00:05:35.910,根据这个新的规划的话,,,
00:05:35.911,00:05:37.800,到2020年,,,
00:05:37.801,00:05:41.490,中国高铁里程数将达到三点八万公里,00:05:34.040,00:05:41.700,"According to the latest plan, the mileage of China's high-
speed rail will reach 38,000 kilometers by 2025."
00:05:42.930,00:05:43.320,那么,,,
00:05:43.321,00:05:48.150,谈到中国高铁这个巨大的成绩,00:05:42.240,00:05:47.500,"I am proud of the great achievements
of China's high-speed rail."
00:05:48.151,00:05:49.380,除了自豪之外,,,
00:05:49.381,00:05:52.650,我自己有一些回忆,00:05:47.860,00:05:51.700,"Besides, it brings back some of my memories."
00:05:52.651,00:05:55.560,我觉得今天跟大家一起分享着,00:05:52.140,00:05:54.940,I’m going to share them with you.
00:05:55.561,00:05:57.840,那么八年前的是2011年,,,
00:05:58.890,00:06:00.270,恩我出了一本书,00:05:55.300,00:06:02.600,"Eight years ago, in 2011, I published the book
""China Shock: the Rise of a Civilized Country""."
00:06:00.271,00:06:01.380,叫中国震撼,,,
00:06:01.381,00:06:02.820,一个文明型国家的崛起,,,
00:06:02.821,00:06:04.920,怎么说影响比较大,,,
00:06:04.921,00:06:07.230,当时不少地方请我去做演讲,00:06:02.800,00:06:07.200,"This book was influential and I received
many invitations to give speeches."
00:06:07.231,00:06:12.030,那我记得就是那年八月份上海一个单位请我去演讲,00:06:07.460,00:06:12.000,"That year in August, I was invited to
one institute in Shanghai."
00:06:12.031,00:06:15.870,当时有个媒体人就提了一个颇为尖锐的问题,00:06:12.240,00:06:15.340,A media professional asked me a rather pointed question.
00:06:15.871,00:06:16.290,他说,,,
00:06:16.291,00:06:21.780,你难道不知道刚刚发生这个723高铁事故,00:06:15.800,00:06:21.400,"""Haven't you heard about the 7.23 high-speed
train accident that just happened?"""
00:06:21.781,00:06:23.400,然后挖苦他说,,,
00:06:23.401,00:06:26.460,这难道也是中国震撼吗,00:06:22.000,00:06:25.700,"He mocked me, ""Is this another a China shock?"""
00:06:26.461,00:06:27.480,他问了这么一个问题,00:06:26.460,00:06:28.060,This was his question.
00:06:28.320,00:06:31.410,我说这个事故肯定是个悲剧,00:06:28.340,00:06:31.020,I said that the accident was undoubtedly a tragedy.
00:06:31.411,00:06:36.120,那么我们要调查我说这个该怎么处理就怎么处理,00:06:31.360,00:06:36.100,"""We need to investigate the accident and do everything we should."""
00:06:37.170,00:06:38.460,那么我也跟他解释一下,,,
00:06:38.461,00:06:42.960,我说睡觉这还不是这不是高铁是动车事故,00:06:37.240,00:06:41.960,"I also explained to him that it was in fact the collision
of two electric multiple-unit [EMU] trains,"
00:06:42.961,00:06:44.940,这两者速度上是有差别的,00:06:42.180,00:06:45.500,which are different from high-speed trains.
00:06:44.941,00:06:48.960,你这个时速250公里为界限,00:06:45.600,00:06:48.600,EMU trains has the speed limit of 250 km/h.
00:06:48.961,00:06:51.060,莫谈了一个非常坦率的看法,00:06:49.040,00:06:52.200,"I said frankly, ""You have to compare or measure"
00:06:51.061,00:06:56.580,我说你要比较或者衡量火车的安全水平,00:06:52.200,00:06:57.820,"the safety levels of the trains based on a specific frame of reference""."
00:06:56.581,00:06:58.770,要有一定的参照系,,,
00:06:58.771,00:07:00.480,中国是个超大型的国家,00:06:58.880,00:07:00.540,China is a country of 1.4 billion people.
00:07:00.481,00:07:04.980,我一个春运现在一般都是三十多亿人次啊,00:07:00.680,00:07:04.340,"There are more than 3 billion
passenger trips during the Spring Festival."
00:07:04.981,00:07:07.800,我一个春运恐怕就超过德国十年,00:07:04.720,00:07:10.580,"I am afraid that is more than the number of
train passengers for ten years in Germany."
00:07:07.801,00:07:11.520,货车载客的人数我的人次,,,
00:07:11.521,00:07:12.900,那么让我查,,,
00:07:12.901,00:07:14.520,我查过的就到,00:07:11.580,00:07:15.800,"I also learned that by August 2011,"
00:07:14.521,00:07:16.290,2011年八月的时候,,,
00:07:16.291,00:07:24.360,我们的动车和这个高铁在中华人民共和国大地上已经安全运行了五年了,00:07:16.160,00:07:24.400,"our EMU and high-speed trains had been running
safely all across our country for five years."
00:07:25.620,00:07:27.750,我说这样一个记录的话,,,
00:07:27.751,00:07:30.900,怎么都是世界最好的记录之一,00:07:25.680,00:07:30.000,That must be one of the best records in the world.
00:07:30.901,00:07:32.850,我说我给你打个比方,,,
00:07:32.851,00:07:37.080,我们的动车高铁怎么都是我教研究生水平,00:07:30.940,00:07:37.600,"I proposed an analogy that if our EMU and
high-speed trains were graduate students,"
00:07:38.550,00:07:41.880,美国英国的火车是中学生水平,00:07:38.600,00:07:41.980,"trains in the US and the UK would be secondary school students,"
00:07:41.881,00:07:43.710,印度的火车是幼儿园水平,00:07:41.980,00:07:43.980,and trains in India would be kindergartens.
00:07:44.910,00:07:46.230,坦率的说,,,
00:07:46.231,00:07:49.860,我说研究生也可能犯错啊,00:07:44.720,00:07:49.600,"Frankly speaking, graduate students may also make mistakes,"
00:07:49.861,00:07:54.180,住院人也可能只出研究生的错,00:07:49.900,00:07:53.380,"and middle school students may point out these mistakes,"
00:07:54.181,00:07:57.390,但这个总体的中学生的严峻的差距,00:07:54.180,00:08:00.100,"but the gap between middle school and
graduate school is not small."
00:07:58.440,00:07:59.430,还不一定这么快,,,
00:07:59.431,00:08:00.150,就能克服,,,
00:08:01.350,00:08:02.250,印度的火车,,,
00:08:02.251,00:08:04.680,我说你真的去了解一下,00:08:01.260,00:08:04.000,"If you go to India and travel by train,"
00:08:04.681,00:08:08.040,因为我是实地去印度考察过多次,00:08:04.500,00:08:07.660,"which I have in many trips,"
00:08:08.041,00:08:11.850,你每天早上看那个惊梦买的那个火车,00:08:07.900,00:08:11.360,you can watch trains entering Mumbai every morning.
00:08:11.851,00:08:13.710,就我们小时候看的那个电影,00:08:11.980,00:08:14.380,Many people cling to the tops and the doors of the trains.
,,,00:08:14.380,00:08:19.520,"Just like the old movie ""Railway Guerrilla"",
which many of you might not have watched."
00:08:13.711,00:08:14.940,大家不一定看过了,,,
00:08:14.941,00:08:27.360,铁道游击队那个顶上门上都是八日每天多少事故挂于印度火车这个造成的死亡事故四千人来计算,00:08:20.480,00:08:22.440,So many accidents happen every day.
,,,00:08:22.880,00:08:26.800,Fatalities caused by trains are counted in thousands in India.
00:08:27.361,00:08:37.290,用这么一个事故就来否定中国铁路为中国现代化事业作出的巨大的贡献,00:08:27.360,00:08:34.740,"If you deny the great contribution that our railway
workers have made to China's modernization"
,,,00:08:34.980,00:08:37.300,"because of one accident,"
00:08:37.291,00:08:39.360,我说这是不明智的,00:08:37.400,00:08:40.400,that is unwise and irrational in my view.
00:08:39.361,00:08:40.050,不理性,,,
00:08:41.130,00:08:41.490,我说,,,
00:08:41.491,00:08:43.530,我们现在云贵高,00:08:40.800,00:08:44.740,"We now even built high speed rails in
the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau"
00:08:43.531,00:08:45.600,也很难借高铁,,,
00:08:45.601,00:08:50.340,动车的地质条件都建了这个动车和高铁,00:08:44.740,00:08:49.180,despite its challenging geological conditions.
00:08:50.341,00:08:55.050,所以我说恐怕也是我们一个鼠标跪着或者四川,00:08:50.500,00:08:55.800,To build high-speed rail in provinces like Guizhou or Sichuan
00:08:55.051,00:09:00.540,他见这个高铁的难度就超过美国一个国家自己建这个铁路的难度,00:08:56.240,00:09:00.000,might be even more difficult than building it across the USA.
00:09:00.541,00:09:02.520,所以我说要这样来比较,00:09:00.520,00:09:02.740,We must consider all these factors and differences
00:09:02.521,00:09:04.080,你看问题才比较客观,00:09:02.740,00:09:05.240,to make an objective and rational comparison.
00:09:04.081,00:09:04.950,比较理性,,,
00:09:06.030,00:09:12.930,那么额我觉得就是在背后上反映出一个什么问题,00:09:06.260,00:09:12.300,One problem behind his question is that
00:09:12.931,00:09:16.980,就是你高铁取得了那么精彩的成绩,00:09:12.640,00:09:19.300,"even if we did so well in developing high-speed rail,"
00:09:18.030,00:09:19.740,也就你干的非常自豪,,,
00:09:20.640,00:09:22.650,但如果你由于种种原因,,,
00:09:22.651,00:09:24.330,没把这故事讲好,00:09:20.680,00:09:27.800,"some people may twist or reverse the story
if we don't do well telling the story."
00:09:24.331,00:09:33.780,人家会把这个东西扭着脚反着讲你的巨大的这个阵子才会变成巨大的负资产,00:09:28.740,00:09:32.940,"Our ""positive assets"" will turn into ""negative assets""."
00:09:33.781,00:09:36.360,因为当时随着互联网的兴起啊,00:09:33.800,00:09:37.800,"You may remember that at that time,
when the Internet was emerging,"
00:09:36.361,00:09:42.240,大家一定会记得就是互联网上黑自己国家的这个言论特别多,00:09:37.800,00:09:41.500,so many people were shaming China online
00:09:42.241,00:09:44.760,甚至是占主导地位,00:09:41.760,00:09:44.000,and seemed to be dominant.
,,,00:09:44.680,00:09:46.040,"""The government is bad."""
00:09:44.761,00:09:48.330,政府是坏的国有企业是坏的,00:09:46.500,00:09:47.880,"""The state-owned enterprises are bad."""
00:09:48.331,00:09:51.150,那么国有企业生产的高铁肯定也是坏的,00:09:48.320,00:09:52.680,"""So the high-speed rail built by the
state-owned enterprises are also bad."""
00:09:51.151,00:09:53.160,鸡巴这么一个逻辑,,,
00:09:53.161,00:09:56.340,而且当时一些主流媒体也没有定理,,,
00:09:56.341,00:10:00.360,也是跟着网上的这个舆论再走,00:09:52.920,00:09:59.800,"Some mainstream media were also
carried away by the opinions on the Internet."
00:10:00.361,00:10:03.450,那么我谈这个问题我是蛮有感触的,00:10:00.200,00:10:03.075,I have a lot to say on this issue.
,,,00:10:03.140,00:10:07.800,I have been to the Soviet Union before its dissolution.
00:10:03.451,00:10:14.880,因为我是去过前苏联解体之前去过前南斯拉夫也是阶梯之前我了解他是怎么解体的,00:10:08.140,00:10:11.600,And Yugoslavia before it broke up.
00:10:14.881,00:10:16.380,基本上是两个阶段,00:10:12.220,00:10:16.240,I understand how the dissolution happened through two phases.
00:10:16.381,00:10:20.220,第一阶段是他的知识及有大学的教授啊,00:10:16.460,00:10:23.160,"In the first phase, the intellectual elites,
like university professors and media editors"
00:10:20.221,00:10:24.000,媒体的这个各种各样的主编啊,,,
00:10:24.001,00:10:25.800,被希望话语忽悠,00:10:23.980,00:10:25.700,were sold on the Western narratives.
00:10:25.801,00:10:29.160,认为就是只要才有西方的政治模式,00:10:25.800,00:10:30.520,"They began to believe that as long as they adopted
the Western political and economic models,"
00:10:29.161,00:10:30.660,经济模式,,,
00:10:30.661,00:10:32.190,他面临问题都可以解决,00:10:30.660,00:10:33.200,all the problems facing their country could be solved.
00:10:33.360,00:10:35.700,然后第二步就是政治精英,00:10:33.360,00:10:35.540,"Then, in the second phase, the political elites,"
00:10:35.701,00:10:37.200,他的政治局委员啊,,,
00:10:37.201,00:10:37.890,馋我呀,00:10:35.540,00:10:39.100,"like members of the Politburo, the standing committee,
and even in the general secretary,"
00:10:37.891,00:10:39.240,甚至总书记啊,,,
00:10:39.241,00:10:40.830,也不希望话语忽悠,00:10:39.200,00:10:40.900,were also sold on Western narratives.
00:10:40.831,00:10:42.720,然后就是经济崩溃,,,
00:10:42.721,00:10:45.000,然后就是国家解体,00:10:40.900,00:10:44.700,"Then, the economy collapsed and the country dissolved."
00:10:45.001,00:10:46.230,特别是解体之后,,,
00:10:46.231,00:10:49.920,你看那个财富被西方席卷一空,00:10:45.080,00:10:50.600,"After that, all their wealth was looted by the West."
00:10:50.880,00:10:52.890,所以这个教训太深刻了,00:10:50.800,00:10:52.900,These are profound lessons.
00:10:52.891,00:10:58.800,那么最经典的例子就是戈尔巴乔夫被西方话语完全的忽悠,00:10:53.000,00:10:58.980,"The most persuasive example is Gorbachev, who was
completely sold on Western narratives."
00:10:59.790,00:11:01.920,结果导致了这个国家崩溃,00:10:59.560,00:11:02.200,This led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
00:11:01.921,00:11:03.540,如果今天碰到俄罗斯人,,,
00:11:03.541,00:11:05.220,他稍微有点历史感,00:11:02.200,00:11:04.940,"Today, when you meet a Russian who has a little sense of history,"
00:11:05.221,00:11:05.820,还告诉你,,,
00:11:05.821,00:11:08.310,我们进了三次浩劫,00:11:05.000,00:11:08.140,he will tell you that Russia has experienced three catastrophes.
00:11:08.311,00:11:11.190,第一次是14世纪蒙古人,00:11:08.140,00:11:11.940,The first catastrophe was the Mongol invasion in the 14th century.
00:11:12.690,00:11:14.760,第二次是二次大战时,00:11:12.620,00:11:16.600,"The second one was the Nazi German invasion during
World War II."
00:11:14.761,00:11:19.620,德国法西斯入侵第三次就是苏联解体,00:11:16.600,00:11:19.300,The third one was the collapse of the Soviet Union.
00:11:19.621,00:11:20.340,戈尔巴乔夫,,,
00:11:20.341,00:11:22.080,这个人也很有意思,00:11:19.640,00:11:22.100,Gorbachev was an interesting person.
00:11:22.081,00:11:27.510,他居然才1996年还敢去参加总统竞选,00:11:22.100,00:11:26.800,He even participated in the 1996 presidential campaign.
00:11:27.511,00:11:29.370,结果这个结果是可以想象的,00:11:27.180,00:11:29.500,The result was conceivable.
00:11:29.371,00:11:31.800,他的支持率不到1%,00:11:29.500,00:11:31.900,His approval rating was less than 1%.
00:11:31.801,00:11:33.750,而且是俄罗斯人民把他给抛弃掉,00:11:31.900,00:11:34.080,The Russian people abandoned him.
00:11:35.760,00:11:36.300,那么,,,
00:11:36.301,00:11:39.810,回想2011年的时候坦率讲,00:11:35.480,00:11:41.100,"Looking back to 2011, I personally think that,"
00:11:39.811,00:11:45.360,我个人认为我们当时不少知识精英被西方话语忽悠的差不多了,00:11:41.180,00:11:46.040,"many of the Chinese intellectual elites were
so sold on the Western narratives."
00:11:45.361,00:11:46.560,呵呵,,,
00:11:46.561,00:11:49.770,那个升到今天还有些人被他们忽悠,00:11:46.540,00:11:49.320,"Even today, some still are."
00:11:49.771,00:11:52.770,但今天我觉得看清问题人越来越多,00:11:49.320,00:11:55.800,"But I think more and more people are see through the
western narratives now, especially the younger generations."
00:11:52.771,00:11:54.330,特别是越年轻了,,,
00:11:54.331,00:12:01.770,看着更清楚高铁怎么精彩的一个成功故事会被人有过来讲,00:11:56.380,00:12:01.560,"Even the good story of our successful
high-speed rail development could be twisted."
00:12:01.771,00:12:04.890,大家记得当时这个有些话一说什么,00:12:01.860,00:12:06.800,"You may remember some were saying, ""High-speed trains, please wait for The People""."
00:12:04.891,00:12:08.340,高铁请等一等你的人民呵呵,,,
00:12:08.341,00:12:09.780,高级得着,00:12:07.000,00:12:12.000,"""High-speed trains, wait for your conscience""
and so on."
00:12:09.781,00:12:12.300,你的良心说等等等等,,,
00:12:12.301,00:12:14.610,这个话语太重要了,00:12:12.100,00:12:14.600,This tells us the importance of narrative.
00:12:14.611,00:12:21.300,一定要把中国的事情用中国自己的话把它说清楚,00:12:14.700,00:12:22.200,We must make our stories clear in our ’s own words.
00:12:21.301,00:12:22.620,说透彻,,,
00:12:22.621,00:12:25.230,这样的我们的崛起才会更加顺利,00:12:22.400,00:12:26.600,So China's rise will be one that's smooth and inspiring.
00:12:25.231,00:12:26.760,更加精彩,,,
00:12:26.761,00:12:29.400,否则真的有时候你做了这么多的事情,00:12:26.740,00:12:30.320,"Otherwise, even though we have achieved a lot,"
00:12:29.401,00:12:30.840,取得这么大成就,,,
00:12:30.841,00:12:33.090,就有可能是功亏一篑,00:12:30.820,00:12:32.255,"we might end up in a collapse,"
00:12:33.091,00:12:35.100,甚至前功尽弃,00:12:32.260,00:12:34.400,making all our efforts in vain.
00:12:35.101,00:12:38.100,中国已经觉得今天这么一个弟,00:12:35.100,00:12:37.860,China's rise has come to a stage
00:12:38.101,00:12:41.970,如果我们还被西方那么浅薄的话语忽悠的话,00:12:37.940,00:12:45.220,"that our future generations would blame us
if we still buy into the shallow Western narratives."
00:12:43.170,00:12:46.110,我说我们的后代将会诅咒,,,
00:12:46.111,00:12:47.910,当时你们是一手好牌,,,
00:12:48.990,00:12:50.790,怎么打成那个样子,00:12:46.200,00:12:51.400,"They would say, ""How could you lose when you had such a good hand?"""
00:12:51.930,00:12:52.920,实际上,,,
00:12:52.921,00:12:54.510,过去这么多年了,,,
00:12:54.511,00:12:57.930,我们中国人真的是一心一意搞建设,00:12:51.785,00:12:57.600,"In fact, for so many years, we have been solely
devoted to [infrastructure] construction,"
00:12:57.931,00:13:00.000,一心一意谋发展,00:12:57.700,00:12:59.680,"to [economic] development,"
00:13:00.001,00:13:03.510,一心一意致力于改善民生,00:12:59.900,00:13:03.000,and to improving people's livelihood.
00:13:03.511,00:13:05.310,中国人是从善如流,00:13:03.560,00:13:06.660,The Chinese people are ready to follow good advice.
00:13:05.311,00:13:07.560,只要你真的好做的好,,,
00:13:07.561,00:13:08.850,我们真的想学习,00:13:06.860,00:13:09.700,"If you do it well, we are eager to learn how you do it."
00:13:10.050,00:13:11.340,但是西方不一样,,,
00:13:11.341,00:13:14.070,我们叫做树欲静而风不止,00:13:09.900,00:13:13.860,"But the West is different. We say ""The wind never spares
the tree that wishes to remain in peace."""
00:13:14.071,00:13:18.330,那么他这个大量的异形的化政治化最后导致了什么,00:13:14.060,00:13:18.860,Its massive ideologization and politicization cause
00:13:19.350,00:13:22.500,就是中国人只要一出国,00:13:19.420,00:13:24.920,all kinds of silly questions to be thrown upon the Chinese people.
00:13:22.501,00:13:24.870,就会碰到各种各样的啥问题,,,
00:13:26.070,00:13:28.200,就普通老百姓都会问你这样问题啊,00:13:25.760,00:13:27.980,Ordinary westerners would ask you questions like:
00:13:28.201,00:13:30.660,中国的人权怎么这么糟糕啊,00:13:27.980,00:13:31.000,Why does Chines have horrible human rights?
00:13:30.661,00:13:31.260,对吧,,,
00:13:31.261,00:13:33.480,西藏为什么不能独立啊啊,00:13:31.280,00:13:33.300,Why can't Tibet be independent?
00:13:33.481,00:13:35.850,台湾独立有什么关系啊,00:13:33.300,00:13:35.700,What's the matter if Taiwan becomes a country?
00:13:35.851,00:13:39.120,就是如果你像这样的傻问题,00:13:35.800,00:13:41.220,You don't really mind answering such questions once or twice.
00:13:39.121,00:13:41.640,你就回答一两次没有关系,,,
00:13:41.641,00:13:44.010,你在国外留学或者呆的时间长一点,00:13:41.620,00:13:46.120,"But when you study abroad or stay for a long time, you
will probably have to answer hundreds of them."
00:13:44.011,00:13:46.710,你要回答一百次至少哈哈哈,,,
00:13:46.711,00:13:50.460,我觉得中国已经聚集到今天这个地步,,,
00:13:50.461,00:13:55.140,我真的是认为我们什么问题都不能回避了,00:13:46.780,00:13:54.500,"China has risen up, I don't think we can
avoid any questions any more."
00:13:55.141,00:13:56.670,我们要能够,,,
00:13:57.660,00:13:59.940,回答所有对我们的质疑,00:13:55.160,00:14:00.300,We must be able to respond to all the doubts.
00:14:00.960,00:14:06.990,把中国自己的事情用自己的话语这个说清楚,00:14:01.060,00:14:06.400,We should be able to explain China's stories in our own words.
00:14:06.991,00:14:09.540,今天中国崛起的新时代,00:14:07.100,00:14:11.760,"In this new era of China's rise, we face the defamation of China."
00:14:09.541,00:14:11.130,我们要解决挨骂的问题,,,
00:14:12.210,00:14:17.880,而且我觉得这种一方面是来自西方的秘方,00:14:11.980,00:14:19.200,"Not only from the West, but also from within."
00:14:17.881,00:14:21.270,就来九牧鼓励我们有一些知识界,,,
00:14:21.271,00:14:24.630,有些媒体界的一些人还不自信,00:14:19.540,00:14:24.400,Some intellectuals and media professionals lack confidence.
00:14:24.631,00:14:29.340,要跟着西方化以后不天天骂机的国家骂自己的制度,00:14:24.600,00:14:28.500,"They follow the West to attack our
country and our system."
00:14:29.341,00:14:33.810,但我觉得这个群体和他们的影响与都在日益缩小,00:14:29.140,00:14:35.700,"However, I see the influence of this group of people has been declining."
00:14:33.811,00:14:36.330,这一定是大势所趋,,,
00:14:36.331,00:14:40.980,那么有人脚上中国共产党难以形成自己的话语,00:14:36.320,00:14:41.400,"Someone say that the Chinese Communist Party
has developed its own narrative."
,,,00:14:42.140,00:14:43.220,I agree.
00:14:42.180,00:14:45.210,我同意而且是十分重要,00:14:43.220,00:14:44.980,Narratives are important.
00:14:45.211,00:14:51.990,而我觉得是凝聚全党全国人民共识中定海神针,00:14:45.280,00:14:49.380,"They are like ""Monkey King's magical staff
which maintains the stability in the East Sea""."
,,,00:14:49.380,00:14:51.380,They build consensus among people.
00:14:51.991,00:14:55.650,但是光有官方话语是不够的,00:14:51.760,00:14:56.380,But official narratives are not enough. Why?
00:14:55.651,00:15:01.950,为什么因为一方面是西方话语在今天这个世界上仍然比较强势,00:14:56.800,00:15:02.200,"Because on the one hand, the world is still led by Western narratives."
00:15:03.030,00:15:06.540,第二的社会已经日益开放,,,
00:15:06.541,00:15:09.600,新媒体已经到了这样一个程度,00:15:03.020,00:15:10.220,"On the other hand, our society is increasingly open with new media."
00:15:10.950,00:15:14.160,所以光靠官方话解决不了挨骂的,00:15:10.880,00:15:15.120,Official narratives alone are not enough to respond to defamation.
00:15:15.750,00:15:18.240,所以我是主张要发展,,,
00:15:18.241,00:15:23.040,大力推动我叫学术的民间的国际化的中国话,00:15:15.900,00:15:23.200,"Therefore, I urge that we internationalize Chinese narratives on academic and individual levels."
00:15:24.210,00:15:24.600,那么,,,
00:15:26.130,00:15:29.160,魔族一下也是弥补我们现在话一件事中的一些短板,00:15:24.120,00:15:29.680,"In a sense, this will make up for shortcomings in
our current narrative construction."
00:15:30.450,00:15:31.260,举一个例子,,,
00:15:31.261,00:15:33.810,只是我自己经历过很多次不要,00:15:30.240,00:15:36.100,"For example, the West always talk about China's human rights issues,"
00:15:33.811,00:15:35.580,西方老是说中国人权不好,,,
00:15:36.630,00:15:39.210,然后我们那些官员或者靴子怎么解释呢,00:15:36.480,00:15:39.860,"Some of our officials and scholars would explain,"
00:15:39.211,00:15:42.810,说我们现在还是发展中国家,,,
00:15:42.811,00:15:46.290,我们没有到你们那个阶段对不对,00:15:40.220,00:15:45.600,"“China is still a developing country.
We are in a lower stage than your country."""
00:15:46.291,00:15:48.150,所以人权达不到你们这个标志,00:15:45.900,00:15:48.800,"""So our human rights fall short of your standards”."
00:15:50.340,00:15:54.150,我个人觉得像这样的话是一种非常弱势的,00:15:49.560,00:15:54.020,I personally think that is a weak narrative.
00:15:55.260,00:16:01.230,就你还是承认西方话语系统中来进行这个叙述,00:15:55.300,00:16:00.900,They are still talking in the Western narrative system.
00:16:01.231,00:16:05.790,也就你把这个话语权拱手交给了西方,00:16:01.260,00:16:05.320,"That is, you give up your own right of
speech to the West with both hands"
00:16:05.791,00:16:09.420,让他来裁定你这个做的好不好,00:16:05.840,00:16:10.580,and let the West judge your human rights.
00:16:09.421,00:16:12.090,人权究竟怎样有人我说,,,
00:16:12.091,00:16:13.020,碰到这样的问题,00:16:11.380,00:16:14.040,"Someone asked me: “How would you answer this question?"""
00:16:13.021,00:16:14.280,你是怎么回,,,
00:16:14.281,00:16:16.170,我说这个问题很简单,00:16:14.360,00:16:16.100,I said it's not difficult to answer.
00:16:16.171,00:16:19.770,如果你用中国人的眼光来看人权问题,00:16:16.180,00:16:19.520,"If you view human rights from the perspective of Chinese people,"
00:16:19.771,00:16:23.910,或者用联合国的人权标准来看人权问题,00:16:19.860,00:16:23.300,"or view it under the UN’s standards on human rights,"
00:16:23.911,00:16:25.020,我说那对不起,,,
00:16:25.890,00:16:29.190,21世纪到今天为止,00:16:23.580,00:16:33.200,"I must say that the Iraq War is the worst
violation of human rights in the 21st century so far."
00:16:29.191,00:16:32.670,伊拉克战争是对人权最严重的情况,,,
00:16:33.810,00:16:37.980,光是死去的平民就超过十几万流离失所,00:16:33.840,00:16:36.240,"More than 100,000 civilians died."
00:16:37.981,00:16:38.940,超过数百万,00:16:36.660,00:16:39.460,Millions were displaced or homeless.
00:16:39.930,00:16:40.590,坦率讲,,,
00:16:40.591,00:16:43.260,你可以跟美国人说的说,00:16:39.900,00:16:42.200,You can tell the Americans frankly that
00:16:43.261,00:16:46.350,如果你不把这个严重的侵权行为,00:16:42.420,00:16:47.000,if you can’t  explain this serious violation
00:16:47.490,00:16:52.800,向伊拉克人民向中国人民向世界解释清楚的你有什么资格来跟我谈,00:16:47.000,00:16:50.780,"to people in Iraq, in China, and the rest of the world,"
00:16:52.801,00:16:55.170,人群资格都没有,00:16:51.460,00:16:54.400,you don't have the right to talk about human rights with us.
00:16:55.171,00:16:57.990,我觉得自己比较强势的中国话,00:16:55.180,00:16:57.700,I think this is a stronger Chinese narrative.
00:16:57.991,00:17:04.020,大家都知道这么多年来西方对世界的主流政治叙述,00:16:57.920,00:17:00.980,"Everyone knows that over the years,"
00:17:04.021,00:17:08.910,有一个就是范式叫做是民主还是专制,00:17:01.240,00:17:09.000,"the West describes mainstream political
paradigms as ""Democracy"" or ""Autocracy""."
00:17:10.140,00:17:11.670,那么什么是民族,,,
00:17:11.671,00:17:13.140,什么是专制,,,
00:17:13.141,00:17:14.940,是西方国家定的,00:17:10.100,00:17:16.400,"And ""Democracy"" or ""Autocracy"" are defined by Western countries."
00:17:14.941,00:17:16.200,不是其他国家定的,,,
00:17:17.070,00:17:17.310,那么,,,
00:17:17.311,00:17:21.390,只有采用西方的多党制和普选制,00:17:16.795,00:17:22.200,"Democracy can only be adopting the multi-
party system and universal suffrage."
00:17:21.391,00:17:24.150,才是民族在他们所谓的普世价值,00:17:22.300,00:17:24.600,This is their so-called “universal value”.
00:17:25.440,00:17:27.570,西方人很多做学问非常,,,
00:17:27.571,00:17:29.310,包括媒体非常,00:17:25.180,00:17:31.000,"Many West scholars and the media, in my words,
are ""taking the lazy man's way""."
00:17:29.311,00:17:31.380,我叫懒汉做学问,,,
00:17:31.381,00:17:33.510,然后可以问你啊,00:17:31.380,00:17:35.500,"They will ask you: ""When will you reform your political system?"""
00:17:33.511,00:17:36.180,你们什么时候进行政治改革,,,
00:17:36.181,00:17:38.970,其中一个问题怎么还没有进行政治改革,00:17:35.700,00:17:39.600,"""Why hasn't China reformed its political system?"""
00:17:40.470,00:17:40.920,也就是说,,,
00:17:40.921,00:17:42.660,只要你不像西方模式靠拢,00:17:40.380,00:17:43.420,"If you do not move closer to the Western model,"
00:17:44.010,00:17:47.220,那么你就是这方面远远没有达标,00:17:43.880,00:17:46.800,you don't meet their standards
00:17:47.221,00:17:51.210,永远不能进入这个主流社会文明社会,00:17:47.220,00:17:50.800,"and your society will never be seen as
a mainstream or a civilized one."
00:17:51.211,00:17:53.460,那么现在我们回头看民主还是专制,00:17:51.060,00:17:54.600,"The paradigm of dividing countries into ""democracies"" or ""autocracies"""
00:17:53.461,00:17:58.830,这个分析的范式早已成为西方策动颜色革命,00:17:55.260,00:17:58.460,has long been an ideological instrument for the West
00:17:58.831,00:18:02.820,颠覆非西方政府政权的一种意识形态的工具,00:17:58.860,00:18:03.360,to spark color revolutions and to subvert non-Western governments.
00:18:04.200,00:18:05.160,这不用话语,,,
00:18:05.161,00:18:07.800,虽然还可以忽悠一部分,00:18:03.920,00:18:07.600,Such a narrative can still sell well to some
00:18:07.801,00:18:10.920,甚至在不少国家造成了政权更迭,00:18:07.880,00:18:11.400,as they have caused regime changes in quite a few countries.
00:18:12.000,00:18:13.620,但今天我们看到,,,
00:18:13.621,00:18:17.430,随着阿拉伯之春纷纷变成阿拉伯之冬,00:18:11.860,00:18:17.000,"However, we see that the Arab Spring turned into the Arab Winter,"
00:18:17.431,00:18:21.210,随着西方自己面临的问题越来越多,00:18:17.260,00:18:20.600,"as the West itself faces more problems,"
00:18:21.211,00:18:27.210,很多西方人也看到了西方政治模式出现越来越多的问题,00:18:21.240,00:18:26.500,"many Westerners are starting to see more
problems in the Western political model."
00:18:27.211,00:18:29.250,以西方人也开始反思,00:18:27.160,00:18:30.060,Some Westerners began to reflect on their model.
00:18:30.450,00:18:32.160,零八年底,,,
00:18:32.161,00:18:35.730,我到印度去演讲和考察,00:18:30.140,00:18:35.100,"At the end of 2008, I visited India and gave a speech."
00:18:35.731,00:18:37.590,那么那年十一月,00:18:35.660,00:18:39.500,"In that November, some of you may remember,"
00:18:37.591,00:18:43.800,大家可能有些人会记得在孟买发生了一个很严重的大规模的恐怖主义袭击,00:18:39.660,00:18:44.060,a serious large-scale terrorist attack happened in Mumbai.
00:18:44.820,00:18:47.460,当时印度的反恐精锐部队,,,
00:18:47.461,00:18:52.350,他们花了九个小时才抵达恐怖主义活动的现场,00:18:44.740,00:18:52.400,"It took India's elite anti-terrorist forces nine hours to
arrive at where the attack happened."
00:18:53.430,00:18:55.470,那么当时我在印度,00:18:53.340,00:18:57.520,"During my stay, there was an uproar across Indian media."
00:18:55.471,00:18:57.480,印度的这个舆论哗然,,,
00:18:59.040,00:19:01.770,让我在德里大学正好做一个讲座,00:18:58.900,00:19:02.900,"I happened to be giving a talk on the
China Model at the University of Delhi."
00:19:01.771,00:19:03.330,讲中国模式,,,
00:19:03.331,00:19:05.370,当时的互动之后,,,
00:19:05.371,00:19:08.430,那个人问他不是很尖锐还是挺友善的,00:19:03.300,00:19:08.400,"In the Q&A section, one person asked
this question in a quite friendly manner."
00:19:08.431,00:19:09.360,有问题他是这样说,,,
00:19:09.361,00:19:10.440,他说,,,
00:19:10.441,00:19:15.870,如果中国碰到这样的恐怖主义袭击会如何应对,00:19:08.740,00:19:16.000,"He asked: ""How would China respond to such a terrorist attack?"""
00:19:17.490,00:19:20.400,那么我当时这样说的我说,,,
00:19:20.401,00:19:25.170,中国到现在还没有碰到这么大规模的恐怖主义袭击,00:19:17.120,00:19:24.660,I answered that China had not had a terrorist attack of such scale.
00:19:25.171,00:19:26.250,恐怕会来新疆,,,
00:19:26.251,00:19:27.330,那个七五事件,,,
00:19:27.331,00:19:30.480,大概是可以说当时还没有发生什么,00:19:25.100,00:19:29.700,"The Urumqi 7.5 Incident in Xinjiang may be
 but it happened in 2009."
00:19:30.481,00:19:32.700,但是我说呢08年吗,,,
00:19:32.701,00:19:33.000,我说,,,
00:19:33.001,00:19:35.640,我们发生了一个汶川地震来着,00:19:30.160,00:19:37.200,"I said in China's response to the 2008
Wenchuan earthquake, magnitude 8,"
00:19:35.641,00:19:37.500,特大型的地震,,,
00:19:37.501,00:19:43.110,我说这个正宗的是在中国中部的四川的山区,00:19:37.460,00:19:43.200,"The epicenter was in Sichuan, a mountainous province in central China,"
00:19:44.280,00:19:48.540,是远离我们的经济中心金融中心,00:19:44.260,00:19:48.000,far away from our economic and financial centers.
00:19:48.541,00:19:53.490,但是我说我们的军队12十分钟内就开始进行动员,00:19:48.580,00:19:52.980,But our army was mobilized within 20 minutes.
00:19:53.491,00:19:58.590,我们的领导人是两个小时之内就做到飞机奔赴灾区,00:19:53.420,00:19:58.200,Our leaders began to fly to the disaster area in two hours.
00:19:58.591,00:20:05.790,我们的医疗队三天内就覆盖了所有一千多个受灾的这个乡镇,00:19:58.400,00:20:05.000,"Our medical teams covered all affected towns
 in three days which were over 1000 in number"
00:20:05.791,00:20:08.190,直接救助两千多万灾民,00:20:05.740,00:20:09.100,"and directly helped more than 20
million affected people."
00:20:09.900,00:20:12.720,当时有个印度学者听了之后,00:20:09.940,00:20:15.100,I can still remember how the Indian scholar looked.
00:20:12.721,00:20:19.620,这个我还记得他的表情就是很显然就是觉得不服气,00:20:15.380,00:20:19.100,"Obviously, he was unconvinced."
00:20:19.621,00:20:21.570,所以他就又问了个问题,00:20:19.560,00:20:21.680,So he asked another question.
00:20:21.571,00:20:27.090,说你是不是想证明就是专制比民主更有效率,00:20:21.680,00:20:27.600,"He asked whether I wanted to prove that
autocracy is more efficient than democracy."
00:20:29.010,00:20:29.160,哎,,,
00:20:29.161,00:20:32.760,我说这个讲法确实不厚道,00:20:28.860,00:20:34.400,I said this statement was not kind or fair.
00:20:32.761,00:20:33.540,不公道,,,
00:20:33.541,00:20:33.780,哎,,,
00:20:33.781,00:20:35.340,我说,,,
00:20:35.341,00:20:37.470,坦率讲这不是一个,,,
00:20:38.520,00:20:41.310,专制比民主更有效率,00:20:34.985,00:20:41.100,"Frankly, we shouldn't be talking about the
efficiency of autocracy and democracy,"
00:20:41.311,00:20:46.050,而是梁镇有个个问题比列支笔吧,00:20:41.200,00:20:47.700,but the efficiency of good governance and bad governance.
00:20:46.051,00:20:48.030,他们能更有效率,,,
00:20:48.031,00:20:53.070,这个是我经过认真研究后得出一个重要的结论,00:20:47.900,00:20:52.700,This is an important conclusion from my research.
00:20:53.071,00:20:55.020,我这个饭是伤你的蝙蝠,00:20:52.920,00:20:55.480,I call it the overthrow of the paradigm.
00:20:56.220,00:20:56.700,然后呢,,,
00:20:56.701,00:20:57.630,我又补充一下,,,
00:20:57.631,00:21:01.860,我说梁镇的可以使西方制度,00:20:56.200,00:21:01.320,I also added that good governance can be a Western system
00:21:01.861,00:21:06.330,两者也可以是非西方的制度最很重要,00:21:01.840,00:21:04.300,or a non-Western system.
,,,00:21:04.860,00:21:06.320,This is an important view.
00:21:06.331,00:21:08.280,我说中国就是这样的一个经典案例,00:21:06.320,00:21:08.120,China is a typical example.
00:21:08.281,00:21:11.160,虽然我们也自己问题,00:21:08.120,00:21:10.800,Our system has its own problems.
00:21:11.161,00:21:14.970,在总体上必须让绝大多数国家做的要好,00:21:11.080,00:21:15.200,"But as a whole, it has done a better job than most of the world."
00:21:16.680,00:21:20.700,关键下边我也是我说劣质也可以是西方的模式,00:21:16.660,00:21:22.900,"More importantly, bad governance can also be a Western system."
00:21:20.701,00:21:22.830,西方的钱做这个太重要,,,
00:21:24.090,00:21:26.640,我说我可以举出一百个例子,00:21:24.100,00:21:26.360,I can count a hundred examples.
00:21:26.641,00:21:28.560,从最烂的伊拉克,,,
00:21:28.561,00:21:29.220,阿富汗,00:21:26.360,00:21:31.000,"From the worst systems like Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, etc."
00:21:29.221,00:21:29.910,海地,,,
00:21:29.911,00:21:31.020,利比里亚登的,,,
00:21:32.040,00:21:35.790,到当时已经破产的就像希腊这样的国家,00:21:32.000,00:21:37.400,to the bankrupt governments in developed countries like Greece and Iceland.
00:21:35.791,00:21:38.340,冰岛这样的所谓发达国家啊,,,
00:21:38.341,00:21:39.900,都没有治理好,00:21:38.360,00:21:39.800,They didn't achieve good governance.
00:21:39.901,00:21:41.820,我记得我当时回答完了之后,,,
00:21:41.821,00:21:47.010,这个打人的报告厅里出现一阵沉默,00:21:39.980,00:21:46.400,"I remember that the audience was silent
after hearing my answer."
00:21:47.011,00:21:48.150,还能会议主席说的,,,
00:21:48.151,00:21:48.510,看来,,,
00:21:48.511,00:21:50.460,我们印度人也在反思,00:21:47.000,00:21:51.700,"The moderator of the meeting said ""It seems that we
Indians are also reflecting on our system."""
00:21:52.230,00:21:53.040,我相信,,,
00:21:53.041,00:21:54.960,随着中国进步的崛起,00:21:52.140,00:21:55.000,"I believe that along with the rise of China,"
00:21:54.961,00:22:01.590,这样一个饭是中国画一个范式鬼被越来越多的国家和学者和人民所接受,00:21:55.000,00:22:01.480,"the paradigm of Chinese narratives will be accepted
by more countries, scholars, and people."
00:22:02.730,00:22:06.900,那么背后时就是我们的这个话,,,
00:22:06.901,00:22:08.400,更加实事求是,00:22:02.840,00:22:13.300,"The reason behind this is that our narrative
""seeks truth from the facts"" and shows the truth."
00:22:08.401,00:22:10.470,更能够更好的,,,
00:22:11.670,00:22:13.740,展现这个真实的世界,,,
00:22:13.741,00:22:15.900,当然这个时间这方面很多,00:22:13.665,00:22:17.500,A lot more can be shared about this.
00:22:15.901,00:22:17.700,对于可以和大家分享,,,
00:22:17.701,00:22:21.630,但今天要不我们暂时就讲八字好不好,00:22:17.600,00:22:22.500,But today I will end my speech for now. Thank you everyone.
00:22:21.631,00:22:22.140,谢谢大家,,,
00:22:26.970,00:22:28.110,谢谢张教授辛苦,00:22:26.300,00:22:28.800,"Thank you, Professor Zhang. Please have a seat."
00:22:28.111,00:22:29.010,您请坐,,,
00:22:29.011,00:22:29.940,刚才你也说了,,,
00:22:29.941,00:22:31.950,要把中国的事情讲清楚,,,
00:22:31.951,00:22:33.360,对我们自己讲清楚,00:22:28.900,00:22:35.500,"You said we need to make China's stories clear
to ourselves and the international community."
00:22:33.361,00:22:35.700,可能也要向国际社会讲清楚啊,,,
00:22:35.701,00:22:39.150,那么到底从哪儿开始比较好呢,00:22:35.585,00:22:38.405,"So, where should we start?"
,,,00:22:39.015,00:22:42.800,The scale of China's rise is large.
00:22:39.151,00:22:47.640,以中国现在崛起的规模一带一路数千个项目同时在进行,00:22:43.020,00:22:46.600,Thousands of projects in the “Belt and Road” Initiative.
00:22:47.641,00:22:49.170,我跟一些国企老总,,,
00:22:49.171,00:22:49.770,我也说了,,,
00:22:49.771,00:22:53.610,我们讨论中国画走向世界,00:22:47.580,00:22:53.100,"I have discussed Chinese narrative with
some leaders of state-owned enterprises."
00:22:53.611,00:22:53.880,我说,,,
00:22:53.881,00:22:56.100,您不能光在那搞建设,00:22:53.315,00:22:55.800,I said building the infrastructure abroad isn't enough.
00:22:56.101,00:23:00.420,你们要到电视台到网站去侃侃而谈,00:22:55.900,00:23:00.600,You need to talk on TV stations and the Internet.
00:23:01.590,00:23:04.200,告诉我们干什么要这样做,00:23:01.100,00:23:07.100,"You can tell the audience why we're building this
and what kind of benefits it will bring to the people."
00:23:04.201,00:23:07.590,这个对谁对大家有什么样的好处,,,
00:23:07.591,00:23:10.590,从各种具象的问题开始谈是的,00:23:07.200,00:23:09.700,Talk about specific problems.
00:23:10.591,00:23:13.320,其实每一个人都可以是这样的一个使者,00:23:10.140,00:23:16.100,"Yes, everyone can be an envoy,
a speaker, and a promoter."
00:23:13.321,00:23:16.560,一个演说者这样的一个推广者,,,
00:23:16.561,00:23:20.730,那接下来小组这几年就是习近平谈治国理政,00:23:16.400,00:23:18.300,"Next, comments from the panel."
00:23:20.731,00:23:23.040,翻译了几十种语言的版本,00:23:18.300,00:23:22.800,"In recent years, Xi Jinping's book ""The Governance of China""
has been translated into many languages."
00:23:23.041,00:23:24.420,大家都在看下去,00:23:22.960,00:23:24.260,It's a globally well-received book.
00:23:24.421,00:23:25.980,我觉得大家发自内心的,00:23:24.260,00:23:27.520,People's interest in China's governance
00:23:25.981,00:23:30.630,那么在研究这个问题就说明现在西方的这种民主理论,00:23:27.820,00:23:33.100,also shows that Western democratic theories have flaws.
00:23:30.631,00:23:32.130,他是有漏洞的,,,
00:23:32.131,00:23:33.270,他就罢了,,,
00:23:33.271,00:23:36.090,但问题是他们自己如果不说出来的话,00:23:33.360,00:23:37.520,"Even if they don't admit it now,
there will be someone who eventually points it out."
00:23:36.091,00:23:37.770,总有人去解除说出来,,,
00:23:37.771,00:23:40.050,我觉得这日子可能不太会承认了,00:23:37.640,00:23:39.900,I don't think they will admit it.
00:23:40.051,00:23:42.630,对所以说这个时候我觉得确实应该说出来,00:23:39.900,00:23:42.500,No. And I feel that it's time someone should point it out.
00:23:42.631,00:23:46.170,因为本身这也是一个负责任国家他应该做的事情,00:23:42.500,00:23:45.800,A responsible country should tell the truth.
00:23:46.171,00:23:51.780,但现在的问题是说有一些国际社会中规则制度管不住这些霸道的国家,00:23:46.120,00:23:51.400,"However, some international rules are not
effectively binding the hegemonic governments."
00:23:51.781,00:23:54.330,安理会不给他授权他照样去打,00:23:51.400,00:23:54.000,"They were able to get around the UN
Security Council and start the war."
00:23:54.331,00:23:57.000,美国人别给他授权他想办法绕过去,00:23:54.180,00:23:56.900,They also managed to bypass the opposition from the American people.
00:23:57.001,00:23:59.250,到最后最了不得的就是说,00:23:56.900,00:24:01.020,"In the end, most incredibly, Bush Jr. said
that no evidence of such weapons was found,"
00:23:59.251,00:24:01.590,小不是说最后没有找到那个证据,,,
00:24:01.591,00:24:02.610,这事情就过去了,,,
00:24:02.611,00:24:06.480,好像美国的民主制度也没有对他进行一个追溯追问这个事情,00:24:01.520,00:24:05.800,"And he could get away with that. It seems
that American democracy did not follow up on it."
00:24:06.481,00:24:08.250,说实话我们是无法理解的,00:24:05.800,00:24:07.800,I honestly don't understand why.
00:24:08.251,00:24:13.890,因此我觉得只有从根子上就是什么是真正的民主五百克不能有你西方的学者,00:24:08.040,00:24:14.220,"So, at the root of the problem, the true definition
of democracy should be open-ended,"
00:24:13.891,00:24:16.470,你自己去洗它是一个开放式的,00:24:14.220,00:24:16.360,not exclusively written by western scholars.
00:24:16.471,00:24:17.280,谁有道理,00:24:16.360,00:24:18.720,We all have the right to enrich and improve it.
00:24:17.281,00:24:20.670,谁就丰富它优化的所谓的普世价值也好,,,
00:24:20.671,00:24:21.570,或者什么样的价值啊,00:24:19.200,00:24:22.700,"The so-called ""universal value"", or whatever value, came pre-defined."
00:24:21.571,00:24:24.930,这些词都是先来的普世价值实际背后那个词,,,
00:24:24.931,00:24:26.340,所以叫全宇宙的,00:24:23.100,00:24:27.795,"The word “universal” suggests the value applies to the
universe/world and hence occupies the highest ground ."
00:24:26.341,00:24:28.140,那么他直接就占领最高的了,,,
00:24:28.141,00:24:30.060,那你后来者其实在想打破,,,
00:24:30.061,00:24:30.390,他说,,,
00:24:30.391,00:24:34.050,本身就给你设置了一个非常大的这个维度的怎么个困难,00:24:28.080,00:24:33.300,"When the latecomers try to renew this definition, they
are at a largely disadvantaged position."
00:24:34.051,00:24:37.020,所以就是我前面讲的对话又要接地气,00:24:33.365,00:24:38.400,"Like I said earlier, our narrative must be based on
realities, and be able to make ourselves clear."
00:24:37.021,00:24:39.060,也能把问题说清楚啊,,,
00:24:39.061,00:24:43.080,有时候光是两朵花与焦虑还不够,00:24:38.505,00:24:43.000,"Sometimes, we need more than two narratives in one conversation."
00:24:43.081,00:24:45.000,还一句话作为铺垫,,,
00:24:45.001,00:24:46.650,一会作为搭桥,00:24:43.000,00:24:49.100,"We need some other narratives to serve as foundations
and bridges between them, for a good communication."
00:24:46.651,00:24:47.310,然后呢,,,
00:24:47.311,00:24:48.420,才能更好的沟通,,,
00:24:49.350,00:24:51.810,当我们觉得自己讲不好中国故事的时候,00:24:49.220,00:24:54.060,"When we feel we are unable to tell the stories of China,
it's because we don't known enough about China."
00:24:51.811,00:24:54.780,是因为你自己对中国还缺乏了解,,,
00:24:54.781,00:24:57.120,我们虽然都生活在中国,00:24:54.680,00:24:58.000,"Although we all live in China,"
00:24:57.121,00:24:57.960,我们是中国人,,,
00:24:57.961,00:25:00.810,但是这个国家的历史到底是怎样,,,
00:25:00.811,00:25:04.470,我们各种各样的这个社会的构成到底是怎样,00:24:58.000,00:25:04.120,"what do we know about our history
and our complicated social composition?"
00:25:04.471,00:25:07.680,随着时代的发展又是会产生怎样的矛盾,00:25:04.560,00:25:08.920,"What kind of contradictions will emerge
as the time changes?  How do we resolve them?"
00:25:07.681,00:25:08.640,怎么去解决,,,
00:25:08.641,00:25:11.070,它每个人可能对这些困惑,00:25:09.160,00:25:12.000,Many of us don't have the answers.
00:25:11.071,00:25:12.420,他没有找到答案,,,
00:25:12.421,00:25:14.130,对其实我是希望,,,
00:25:14.131,00:25:19.770,这就是中国就是让唤醒每个人对于我们自己知道不回,00:25:12.460,00:25:18.880,"I hope ""China Now"" can clear our misunderstandings
of China's political system."
00:25:19.771,00:25:22.890,很多人觉得假制度政治东西很危险,00:25:19.720,00:25:23.280,Many would think politics is dangerous and avoid talking about it.
00:25:22.891,00:25:25.980,就不要碰这个这个梦想是吧,00:25:23.600,00:25:26.960,Or “I can't explain it.”
00:25:25.981,00:25:27.210,反正我也讲不清楚,,,
00:25:27.211,00:25:29.550,可是我觉得我们其实年轻人准备好了,00:25:27.300,00:25:29.600,But I think the younger generations are ready.
00:25:29.551,00:25:32.070,我们这就是中国现场的观众朋友,00:25:29.600,00:25:34.100,"The audience of China Now has all come
with their observations and questions."
00:25:32.071,00:25:34.530,他们都是带着问题带着研究来的事,,,
00:25:34.531,00:25:37.440,所以接下来就到了提问尖锐问题的时候,00:25:34.185,00:25:37.000,"Now, it’s time for their pointed questions."
00:25:37.441,00:25:38.370,大家想听什么,,,
00:25:38.371,00:25:40.890,尽管提举手示意放马过来,00:25:37.000,00:25:40.260,Please raise your hand if you have a question.
00:25:40.891,00:25:44.340,这位朋友欢迎张教授好,00:25:40.440,00:25:42.580,"Yes, please. Welcome."
,,,00:25:42.840,00:25:44.800,"Hello, Professor Zhang and Madam Moderator."
00:25:44.341,00:25:45.300,主持人好你好,00:25:44.900,00:25:46.800,I'm a government employee.
00:25:45.301,00:25:49.290,我是政府及我个人比较关注台湾问题,00:25:47.200,00:25:49.480,I'm very interested in Taiwan.
00:25:49.291,00:25:55.290,想听听张教授对我们国家统一前途的看法是早点同意好呢,00:25:49.680,00:25:53.400,"I would like to hear Professor Zhang's opinion on the
our country's reunification."
00:25:55.291,00:25:57.210,还是万里挑一好,00:25:53.920,00:25:56.120,Is it better to do it sooner or later?
00:25:57.211,00:25:58.440,这个问题很直接,00:25:56.120,00:25:57.460,You're very straightforward.
00:25:58.441,00:26:00.660,还是非和平统一,00:25:57.460,00:26:00.760,Is it better to have a peaceful reunification or more feasible to have a non-peaceful one?
00:26:00.661,00:26:01.740,更可行,,,
00:26:01.741,00:26:03.900,就可以互相讨论辩论,00:26:01.600,00:26:04.060,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:26:05.580,00:26:08.040,我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:26:05.380,00:26:07.340,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:26:08.041,00:26:09.300,中国人你要自信,00:26:08.000,00:26:09.820,"China, be confident."
00:26:11.250,00:26:14.310,这就是中国青张维迎说,00:26:10.860,00:26:14.140,China Now with Zhang Weiwei.
00:26:16.620,00:26:18.540,我个人比较关注台湾问题,00:26:16.260,00:26:19.400,I'm very interested in Taiwan.
00:26:18.541,00:26:24.540,小蜻蜓张教授对我们国家统一前途的看法是早点同意好呢,00:26:19.400,00:26:22.900,"I would like to hear Professor Zhang's opinion on the
our country's reunification."
00:26:24.541,00:26:27.690,还是管理这个问题很直接,00:26:23.100,00:26:25.300,Is it better to do it sooner or later?
00:26:27.691,00:26:30.870,还是非和平统一更恶心,00:26:25.740,00:26:30.600,Is it better to have a peaceful reunification or more feasible to have a non-peaceful one?
00:26:30.871,00:26:41.070,像这个你仔细读习主席这篇谈话就是告台湾同胞书四十周年纪念大会上的讲话,00:26:30.800,00:26:36.320,"If you read President Xi’s speech at the
fortieth anniversary of publishing"
,,,00:26:36.320,00:26:40.200,"“The Message to Compatriots in Taiwan”,"
,,,00:26:40.940,00:26:44.540,There was a well-said comment:
00:26:41.071,00:26:51.300,他这边这个话讲的很到位的就是台湾问题源于中华民族积弱积贫的时候,00:26:45.200,00:26:51.400,"""The Taiwan issue stemmed from China’s past weakness and poverty"""
00:26:52.950,00:26:55.320,而将终结于问题的解决,,,
00:26:55.321,00:26:58.110,终结中华民族复兴的时候,00:26:52.720,00:26:58.200,"""and will end in our nation's great rejuvenation."""
00:26:59.160,00:26:59.460,所以,,,
00:26:59.461,00:27:01.680,这个解读并不那么复杂,00:26:58.980,00:27:01.680,It's not difficult to interpret this statement.
00:27:01.681,00:27:02.130,哎,,,
00:27:02.131,00:27:06.540,其实大家看看我们最近推出来的一系列的对台政策,00:27:01.920,00:27:06.720,"If we look at our recently launched Taiwan policies,"
00:27:07.620,00:27:08.610,张老师特别习惯,,,
00:27:08.611,00:27:10.410,从国际对比中来看,00:27:07.580,00:27:11.960,Professor Zhang likes to view China's problems through global comparison.
00:27:10.411,00:27:17.190,中国的问题俩也是韩国人特别羡慕你俩现在自由行坐飞机去台湾了,00:27:12.340,00:27:16.360,The Koreans are envious of our free travels across the Taiwan Strait.
00:27:17.191,00:27:20.400,台湾每年六百万人来任斯来回,00:27:16.680,00:27:20.100,Over 6 million people fly across the strait a year now.
00:27:20.401,00:27:23.160,他们说你们哪是分裂你们是统一的,00:27:20.400,00:27:22.700,"The Koreans say, ""You are not divided."""
00:27:23.161,00:27:24.210,所以我们再看一看,,,
00:27:24.211,00:27:26.340,习近平总书记2014年说的,00:27:23.000,00:27:25.975,General Secretary Xi Jinping said in 2014:
00:27:26.341,00:27:31.080,我们追求的不仅是形式上统一是两岸人民的心灵契合,00:27:26.280,00:27:30.600,"""Our pursuit is not only the unity in form, but also
the harmony of the people."""
00:27:31.081,00:27:32.820,所以从这个角度上来看,00:27:30.980,00:27:34.000,"From this perspective, unity in form is not the problem to be worried about."
00:27:32.821,00:27:34.170,你那就不是这个问题了,,,
00:27:34.171,00:27:36.270,我们要完成是完全统一,00:27:34.200,00:27:36.000,This is the ultimate unification
00:27:36.271,00:27:39.420,完全统一的标准是心灵契合,00:27:36.180,00:27:40.035,which achieves spiritual harmony and integrated development.
00:27:39.421,00:27:40.410,融合发展,,,
00:27:40.411,00:27:44.220,我们简单回顾一下最近出台的一系列对台政策,00:27:40.260,00:27:44.000,Let us briefly review the recent Taiwan policies.
,,,00:27:44.200,00:27:48.400,"The ""31 Measures” launched on February 28, 2018
[to attract talent and investment]"
00:27:44.221,00:27:55.350,2018年2月28号出台的三十一条惠及台湾同胞的措施还有之后九月份的申领中华人民共和国台湾居民居住证,00:27:48.420,00:27:54.800,"and the application policy in September 2018 on
residence permit for Taiwan residents."
00:27:55.351,00:27:58.830,这个朋友的问题确实也可以用几个成语来说,00:27:55.420,00:27:57.520,"This question can be answered by a few idioms,"
00:27:58.831,00:28:00.570,就是瓜熟蒂落,00:27:57.520,00:27:59.660,“The melon will fall from the stem when it is ripe”
00:28:00.571,00:28:01.770,水到渠成,00:27:59.660,00:28:02.000,and “The channel will be formed hen the river arrives”.
00:28:01.771,00:28:04.110,我想他的关切也是很多人的关切,00:28:02.000,00:28:05.300,I believe many people have the same concern as well.
00:28:04.111,00:28:05.880,大家都关心这个大问题啊,,,
00:28:05.881,00:28:06.450,我们再来看,,,
00:28:06.451,00:28:07.620,还有哪位朋友听啊,00:28:05.640,00:28:07.300,"All right, let's go on to the next question."
00:28:07.621,00:28:08.340,就隔壁的哈,00:28:07.360,00:28:09.060,"Yes, please."
00:28:09.540,00:28:10.770,主持人好章就好,00:28:09.120,00:28:11.100,Hello Madam Moderator and Professor Zhang.
00:28:10.771,00:28:14.550,那号就是我是一名九零后的学生,00:28:11.420,00:28:14.400,I am a post-90s student.
00:28:14.551,00:28:17.850,然后我觉得支付宝改变了我们的支付习惯,,,
00:28:17.851,00:28:22.050,然后向电商这种改变我们购物的习惯,00:28:14.460,00:28:21.440,"Alipay has changed the payment habits of our generation,
and e-commerce has changed our shopping habits."
00:28:22.051,00:28:23.040,然后据我了解,,,
00:28:23.041,00:28:26.430,这些互联网模式都是从西方国家引进过来的,00:28:21.700,00:28:26.100,"As far as I know, these originated from Western countries."
00:28:26.431,00:28:28.560,问您怎样看待这样的现象,00:28:26.260,00:28:29.100,What do you think about such changes. Thank you.
00:28:28.561,00:28:31.080,这些我就以支付宝为例,00:28:29.100,00:28:30.900,I will take Alipay for example.
00:28:31.081,00:28:34.920,就是为什么在中国可以发展的这么快,00:28:31.000,00:28:34.500,Why can Alipay grow so fast in China?
00:28:34.921,00:28:41.880,支付宝将一种形式或者微信支付的形式在美国是不可能被允许的,00:28:34.920,00:28:41.800,"Alipay and WeChat Pay,
are not feasible in the United States."
00:28:43.380,00:28:45.240,一个重要原因是,,,
00:28:45.241,00:28:49.200,他面对庞大的利益集团,00:28:43.180,00:28:48.300,One important reason is the resistance from large interest groups.
00:28:49.201,00:28:53.520,特别是银行和这个信用卡,00:28:49.160,00:28:52.700,Especially banks and credit card companies.
00:28:53.521,00:28:56.430,他这个钱赚的非常得意,00:28:52.700,00:28:57.700,They make money easily and don’t want to be impeded.
00:28:56.431,00:28:58.800,他不希望你来干扰他,,,
00:28:58.801,00:29:03.210,那么中国的习近平的经济思想,00:28:58.820,00:29:06.300,"But in China, one of Xi Jinping's economic thoughts
is the supply-side structural reform."
00:29:03.211,00:29:08.610,你别以为就是供给侧结构性改革旧社会这个巨大的需求,,,
00:29:09.840,00:29:11.100,所以这个呢,00:29:06.780,00:29:12.700,"Our society has a huge demand for it,
so the government supports its development."
00:29:11.101,00:29:13.950,我们就允许他发展模具,,,
00:29:13.951,00:29:15.330,压实饿死了,,,
00:29:15.331,00:29:20.520,我们自己国内的银行和信用卡,00:29:13.360,00:29:19.600,"In a sense, it suppresses the growth of
our domestic banks and credit card companies."
00:29:20.521,00:29:24.480,各种各样的反对的声音把这一块先做起来,00:29:20.205,00:29:24.200,"Despite all the voices of opposition,
we started developing online payment."
00:29:24.481,00:29:29.610,结果我不知道我们真的自己有没有完全想到他带来一场革命,00:29:24.400,00:29:29.900,We may have not expected that online payment led to a revolution.
00:29:30.690,00:29:32.160,所以现在看来,,,
00:29:32.161,00:29:39.810,就是我们这个互联网经济的成功背后有重要的政治优势,00:29:30.540,00:29:38.700,"There seem to be important political factors behind
the success of our Internet economy."
00:29:39.811,00:29:43.470,就是你有一个代表人民整体利益的政治力量,00:29:39.660,00:29:43.000,We have a political power that represents people's overall interests
00:29:43.471,00:29:47.160,可以冲破既得利益的阻挠,00:29:43.460,00:29:46.800,"and can overcome the obstacles from
vested interest."
00:29:47.161,00:29:48.420,我们先把它发展起来,,,
00:29:48.421,00:29:50.670,然后在发展中解决问题,00:29:47.100,00:29:50.260,We develop it and then solve emerging problems.
00:29:50.671,00:29:53.070,然后看看怎么跟银行的利益兼顾,,,
00:29:53.071,00:29:54.930,跟信用卡的利益兼顾,00:29:50.740,00:29:56.800,"We try to balance with the interests of the banks and
credit card companies, and come to a solution."
00:29:54.931,00:29:56.460,要找到解决问题的办法,,,
00:29:57.360,00:30:00.030,很多东西我们的启发来自于西方,00:29:57.035,00:30:02.700,"Many of our inspirations come from the West and their good practices,"
00:30:00.031,00:30:03.090,来自其他国家的一些经验一些好的做法,,,
00:30:03.091,00:30:06.990,但是我们把它变成了我们自己的变成了中国的模式,00:30:02.780,00:30:06.700,but we implement them the Chinese way.
00:30:06.991,00:30:09.420,我十年前去台湾驻点的时候,00:30:06.900,00:30:09.300,"When I was in Taiwan ten years ago,"
00:30:09.421,00:30:13.350,那时候他们已经开始注重过台湾的技术人员已经清零对台湾很熟,00:30:09.300,00:30:13.000,Qinglin likes to talk about Taiwan because he worked as a journalist there.
00:30:13.351,00:30:16.770,所以他们那个时候十年前已经开始谈移动支付,00:30:13.000,00:30:19.500,"Yes. They started talking about mobile payment and
non-monetary transactions ten years ago."
00:30:16.771,00:30:19.290,跟这个吴货币化的这个结算了,,,
00:30:20.370,00:30:22.530,那时候我们觉得哇好先进,00:30:20.160,00:30:22.240,We thought that was very advanced.
00:30:22.531,00:30:23.610,可是当大陆,,,
00:30:23.611,00:30:25.770,支付宝微信支付一片的时候,00:30:22.420,00:30:26.120,"But when Alipay and WeChat Pay have become popular
in the mainland, Taiwan still didn't implement mobile payment."
00:30:25.771,00:30:26.640,他们还是推不动,,,
00:30:26.641,00:30:31.530,为什么就是因为台湾的银行大部分私有的这个什么副帮姓蔡,00:30:26.480,00:30:29.700,Why? Because most of the banks in Taiwan are privately owned.
00:30:31.531,00:30:33.060,那个第一银行姓马,00:30:29.980,00:30:34.100,"The Fubon bank belongs to the Cai family of Cai,
and the First Commercial Bank belongs to Ma and Lin."
00:30:33.061,00:30:34.230,姓林家,,,
00:30:34.231,00:30:37.200,他中间的壁垒是你没有任何第三方的,00:30:34.200,00:30:39.600,"There is no third party who has the financial power
to break down the barriers between them."
00:30:37.201,00:30:39.810,这种财力可以打破之间的这个壁垒,,,
00:30:39.811,00:30:43.890,所以现在台湾移动支付有了是探路的,00:30:39.660,00:30:42.520,"Now, Taiwan has mobile payments"
00:30:43.891,00:30:48.090,这些支付宝微信愿意去贴钱帮你提供这些便利,00:30:42.860,00:30:47.600,because Alipay and WeChat are paying the costs for this service.
00:30:48.091,00:30:52.800,他才能够去补贴各个私有银行之间的那种小小的力,00:30:48.000,00:30:52.300,They are subsidizing the small benefits of the private banks.
00:30:52.801,00:30:55.380,这就是为什么在大陆能够发展起来,00:30:52.860,00:30:55.120,That’s why online payment was first implemented in the mainland
00:30:55.381,00:30:58.860,台湾很早很早就提出来了他做不起来的队,00:30:55.180,00:30:57.800,although Taiwan started talking about it first.
00:30:58.861,00:31:02.460,然后我们再来看我们对面山上有没有人要提问好嘞,00:30:58.840,00:31:01.300,"Okay, now any questions from this side of the audience?"
00:31:02.461,00:31:04.320,这位朋友欢迎,00:31:01.580,00:31:03.520,"Yes, please."
00:31:04.321,00:31:04.770,您好,00:31:03.940,00:31:05.500,"Hello, Professor Zhang."
00:31:04.771,00:31:05.640,张教授,,,
00:31:05.641,00:31:06.630,我是一名学生,,,
00:31:06.631,00:31:08.880,然后我想提一个教育的问题,00:31:05.500,00:31:08.480,I'm a student and I have a question about education.
00:31:08.881,00:31:09.420,然后呢,,,
00:31:09.421,00:31:10.470,就是说教育呢,00:31:08.940,00:31:11.740,Education is a country's soft power.
00:31:10.471,00:31:12.300,是一个国家的一个软实力,,,
00:31:12.301,00:31:17.550,然后改开放四十周年的教育是起到一个十分重要的作用啊,00:31:12.300,00:31:15.200,"It has been very important over the forty
years since Reform and Opening-up."
00:31:17.551,00:31:18.990,但是现在有一种现象,00:31:15.200,00:31:17.700,[The education system has been significantly reformed]
00:31:18.991,00:31:21.720,就是说学生成绩的背后呢,00:31:17.700,00:31:24.600,"But now, students face endless homework
and tutoring sessions to have good grades."
00:31:21.721,00:31:23.250,就是疯狂的作业,,,
00:31:23.251,00:31:24.780,然后不断的补课,,,
00:31:24.781,00:31:27.540,有好的就是教学方式的老师呢,,,
00:31:27.541,00:31:32.490,他就会因为这些评比转入到这个做作业的大军,00:31:24.620,00:31:31.860,Many good teachers have to “teach to the test” and give lots of homework.
00:31:32.491,00:31:35.430,有人说这种事好的有人说是不好的额,00:31:32.200,00:31:35.200,Some approve of them doing so while others don't.
00:31:35.431,00:31:36.810,我想请问下张教授,00:31:35.200,00:31:38.355,I’d like to know what Professor Zhang thinks about this.
00:31:36.811,00:31:38.970,您是如何解读这个现象啊,,,
00:31:38.971,00:31:45.270,还有就是这种教育方式是对是对国民素质的是一种帮助呢,00:31:38.620,00:31:44.200,"I'd also like to know whether this education model will
improve the quality of our population"
00:31:45.271,00:31:47.160,还是一种揠苗助长,00:31:44.320,00:31:47.260,"or it's just ""pulling up seedlings to help them grow""."
00:31:47.161,00:31:51.000,还有是西方国家的教育方式是不是这样子的呢,00:31:47.260,00:31:51.200,How do Western countries do differently?
00:31:51.001,00:31:52.110,谢谢,,,
00:31:52.111,00:31:54.330,谈到教育是很多话,00:31:52.040,00:31:55.100,We have a lot to say when it comes to education.
00:31:54.331,00:31:55.710,可以说,00:31:55.385,00:31:58.300,"The Western education systems in general,
especially in elementary schools,"
00:31:55.711,00:32:01.950,西方总体上这个特别小学教育从综合角度看就是太轻松,00:31:58.300,00:32:01.500,is too easy from our perspective.
00:32:01.951,00:32:03.000,松到什么程度,,,
00:32:03.001,00:32:07.230,连乘法口诀表都不强迫你要背出来做,00:32:01.940,00:32:06.600,"The students don't even have to
memorize the multiplication table."
00:32:07.231,00:32:10.170,这个从中国标准来看下不行,00:32:06.740,00:32:09.740,This is not acceptable by the Chinese standards.
00:32:10.171,00:32:10.890,在中国呢,,,
00:32:10.891,00:32:12.630,有时机遇太严,00:32:09.980,00:32:12.780,But Chinese education is criticized for being too strict
00:32:12.631,00:32:14.760,学生负担太重,00:32:12.780,00:32:14.700,and giving students too much work.
00:32:14.761,00:32:18.360,这个我们小时候没有这么多压力啊,00:32:14.840,00:32:17.160,We didn’t have so much pressure when we were in school.
00:32:18.361,00:32:19.950,我们是放羊式家长,00:32:17.220,00:32:19.400,"Our generation was raised like the ""free range lamb""."
00:32:19.951,00:32:21.030,管部管不过来,00:32:19.400,00:32:22.100,"Our parents were too busy to take care of
so many children in the family."
00:32:21.031,00:32:22.200,孩子太多,,,
00:32:22.201,00:32:24.390,这月孩子都是,00:32:22.100,00:32:24.400,"Now, parents only have one child"
00:32:24.391,00:32:26.310,而且这个独木桥,,,
00:32:26.311,00:32:29.130,一个桥上走过几岁比较困难,00:32:24.400,00:32:28.240,and all the children have to cross one footlog bridge [gaokao standardized test].
00:32:29.131,00:32:34.050,但我的基本的思路就是中西方娘子要坚强,00:32:29.020,00:32:33.800,"I think the fundamental solution is a balance between
the Chinese and Western models."
00:32:34.051,00:32:36.330,我们要适当的放松一点,00:32:34.000,00:32:38.300,"We must be less strict, and they must work harder."
00:32:36.331,00:32:38.550,他们要更加的努力一点,,,
00:32:38.551,00:32:41.760,但是千万不要丢失中国自己教育的优势,00:32:38.400,00:32:41.300,But be careful not to lose our advantages.
00:32:41.761,00:32:44.730,中国中小学的基本工资扎实,00:32:41.840,00:32:45.820,"We gain solid knowledge from K12 education
and this is rare in the world."
00:32:44.731,00:32:45.630,世界少有的,00:32:46.040,00:32:47.100,I agree.
00:32:47.340,00:32:51.660,平常这个知识他是方方面面的,00:32:47.100,00:32:51.500,But knowledge goes beyond what we learn at school.
00:32:51.661,00:32:52.770,你要有时间玩,00:32:51.500,00:32:53.700,The kids need more time to play.
00:32:52.771,00:32:54.090,特别小孩,,,
00:32:54.091,00:32:55.410,他踢球也好,,,
00:32:55.411,00:32:56.340,玩什么也好,00:32:53.920,00:32:57.000,"Sports, games, or anything,"
00:32:56.341,00:32:57.120,游戏也好,,,
00:32:57.121,00:32:59.010,他培养团队精神,00:32:57.000,00:32:58.800,"they build team spirits,"
00:32:59.011,00:33:01.680,他学会接受失败几次挫折,00:32:58.800,00:33:01.400,and learn to deal with failure.
00:33:01.681,00:33:03.930,最终被证明是非常非常重要的,00:33:01.580,00:33:04.900,These are all important qualities.
00:33:05.550,00:33:09.420,所以我觉得这方面就是我们总体上的一个功课,00:33:05.280,00:33:11.600,I agree that we should reduce school workloads.
00:33:09.421,00:33:10.590,我觉得要见父,,,
00:33:10.591,00:33:12.150,我是同意的,,,
00:33:12.151,00:33:15.420,但现在因为已经形成了一个整个的大的气候,00:33:12.020,00:33:15.200,"However, under the existing circumstances"
00:33:15.421,00:33:17.820,你如果是教育部说减负啊,00:33:15.200,00:33:18.300,"if the Ministry of Education urges schools to reduce workloads,"
00:33:17.821,00:33:19.380,马上这种啊,,,
00:33:19.381,00:33:21.720,各种各样的各种班啊,00:33:18.300,00:33:23.480,"all kinds of tutoring and training will
immediately dominate the market."
00:33:21.721,00:33:24.060,培训啊就来占这个市场,,,
00:33:24.061,00:33:24.870,因为没有家长,,,
00:33:24.871,00:33:26.610,还希望孩子多读书,00:33:23.800,00:33:27.000,"Because parents would always want their
children to spend more time studying."
00:33:27.780,00:33:29.790,确实是我的感觉,,,
00:33:29.791,00:33:32.730,就是中国之所以可以有那么快的发展,00:33:27.760,00:33:35.300,"China's rapid growth is not possible without
the educated ""constructors"" of the country."
00:33:32.731,00:33:35.850,跟我们拥有高素质的建设人员,,,
00:33:35.851,00:33:37.830,我不知是不是讲的是基础设施,,,
00:33:37.831,00:33:39.750,就我们所有的这种工作者,00:33:35.300,00:33:41.620,"Not only infrastructure construction, all
contributors to the country are constructing the country."
00:33:39.751,00:33:42.300,我们都可以叫劳动人口建设者,,,
00:33:42.301,00:33:47.430,他们这个高速只是给中国高速发展打下了非常坚实的基础,00:33:42.000,00:33:46.900,"They've laid a very solid foundation for
China's rapid development."
00:33:47.431,00:33:49.800,那我觉得这个真的是我们的教育产业,00:33:47.220,00:33:50.800,And this is achieved through education.
00:33:49.801,00:33:51.300,是我们教育出来的,,,
00:33:51.301,00:33:53.160,虽然我因为也是做家长的,,,
00:33:53.161,00:33:55.080,我也觉得孩子们也很辛苦,00:33:51.220,00:33:55.400,"As a parent, I also feel that children have too much work."
00:33:55.081,00:33:57.690,现在但就像刚才张老师说的,00:33:55.540,00:33:57.440,"But just as Prof. Zhang said,"
00:33:57.691,00:34:01.830,如果说减负可是考试这一环还存在呀,00:33:57.440,00:34:01.300,students still have to take exams even if we want to give them less work.
00:34:01.831,00:34:03.360,他还要升学呀,00:34:01.640,00:34:04.200,They still face the competition to enter better schools.
00:34:03.361,00:34:04.470,那必定就有压力,,,
00:34:04.471,00:34:06.450,所以到底从哪个地方入手,00:34:04.200,00:34:06.200,"So, where should we start?"
00:34:06.451,00:34:10.020,教育的这个才能够额就达到您刚刚讲的啊,00:34:06.260,00:34:12.320,How can we relax the system to an appropriate extend?
00:34:10.021,00:34:10.710,松一点,,,
00:34:10.711,00:34:15.630,但是又正好这确实是因为这个还有一个万不要去比什么状元啊,00:34:12.680,00:34:17.000,"Schools should also stop comparing the
number of graduates into good schools."
00:34:15.631,00:34:17.640,什么人说觉得很无聊,00:34:17.000,00:34:18.560,It’s boring.
00:34:17.641,00:34:21.420,我说爱我说你做个研究很容易发现的,00:34:18.560,00:34:23.800,"If you study the Number One students in the gaokao exam of all provinces,"
00:34:21.421,00:34:24.690,就你把历届的高考状元分析一下,,,
00:34:24.691,00:34:26.820,最后他出的成绩究竟多少,00:34:24.600,00:34:28.900,you can easily find that many of them didn't achieve high later in life.
00:34:26.821,00:34:28.410,做出一流成绩,,,
00:34:28.411,00:34:29.640,这个是很露的多,00:34:29.700,00:34:33.000,"What really matters, I think, is originality and creativity."
00:34:29.641,00:34:37.830,我觉得真的是看有没有元朝你创造了这个我自己八年的中期给邓小平啊,00:34:33.280,00:34:39.700,"I worked as the translator for Deng Xiaoping
and Hu Yaobang in the mid-1980s."
00:34:37.831,00:34:40.380,呼叫八级领导人做过翻译,,,
00:34:40.381,00:34:43.830,他们学历都不高,00:34:40.360,00:34:43.120,They didn’t have high degrees.
00:34:43.831,00:34:45.690,这个智商之高,00:34:43.600,00:34:46.200,But they are intelligent.
00:34:45.691,00:34:46.050,哎,,,
00:34:46.051,00:34:46.560,真的,,,
00:34:46.561,00:34:50.220,所以这个绝对不是大学这一条路,00:34:46.380,00:34:49.900,Getting into a college is not the only way to success.
00:34:50.221,00:34:53.070,你看马云的智商是司机绝对超一点,00:34:50.020,00:34:53.700,Jack Ma is also one of the smartest people in the world.
00:34:54.540,00:34:57.060,所以我觉得这个条条大路通罗马,00:34:54.300,00:34:56.800,"""All roads lead to Rome."""
00:34:57.061,00:35:00.690,这我对家长说的千万别觉得只有一条道啊,00:34:56.800,00:35:01.420,I want to tell parents that university is not their only choice.
00:35:00.691,00:35:02.460,就是要读最好的大学,,,
00:35:02.461,00:35:04.860,我觉得现在网上有一些段子,00:35:02.380,00:35:07.300,"I remember seeing some jokes on the Internet
about how we should change our mindset."
00:35:04.861,00:35:07.440,其实很反应这个该到改变的时候,,,
00:35:07.441,00:35:09.120,比如说有一个经典的段子,,,
00:35:09.121,00:35:12.090,说有一种付款方法是两毛七分钱,00:35:07.300,00:35:14.700,"It says, ""How do you pay if one option is 0.27 yuan/item,
and the other is 0.35 yuan/item?"""
00:35:12.091,00:35:13.830,另外一种是三毛五分钱,00:35:14.700,00:35:16.540,"The kid answers: ""I pay with Alipay."""
00:35:13.831,00:35:19.680,问他应该怎么复合式打用支付宝付这样的这种这种问题的反应,00:35:16.700,00:35:22.040,This is not about the kid being funny.
00:35:19.681,00:35:22.410,但并不是孩子特别爱捣乱,,,
00:35:22.411,00:35:26.160,而是他已经跳出这个题来看整个这个事情,00:35:22.040,00:35:25.660,The kid is thinking out of the box.
00:35:26.161,00:35:27.780,我我能再补充一点吧,00:35:25.720,00:35:27.500,I'd like to add that
00:35:27.781,00:35:34.950,就是我觉得现在我们要多鼓励一些偏科就是一个小孩子,00:35:27.620,00:35:31.960,"I think now we need to be supportive of students
having preferences for some subjects."
00:35:34.951,00:35:36.570,他有一种奇想,00:35:32.640,00:35:39.100,"When a child has an idea or a hobby,
give them the freedom to pursue it."
00:35:36.571,00:35:42.360,一种爱好让他去追求不要他面面具到时间成本,00:35:39.420,00:35:41.300,They don't need to be good at everything.
00:35:42.361,00:35:44.640,如果花在他追求他的爱好上,00:35:41.300,00:35:46.800,"If they spend time on the things the love,
they might have already become the best in the world."
00:35:44.641,00:35:48.150,他可能早就是世界一流或者中国一流,,,
00:35:48.151,00:35:51.450,而且今天中国真的普遍开始富裕起来了,00:35:47.980,00:35:51.000,Chinese people are fairly well-off today
00:35:51.451,00:35:55.560,现在父母都是有房产的真的,00:35:51.380,00:35:54.900,The parents all have properties now.
00:35:55.561,00:35:58.500,中国历史上可能第一代就是学生,,,
00:35:58.501,00:36:03.180,完全可以不为生计而去学习了,00:35:55.120,00:36:02.740,"This might be the first generation of students in Chinese
history who don’t have to study for a living."
00:36:03.181,00:36:03.540,这个时候,,,
00:36:03.541,00:36:05.130,他如果爱好一个东西,00:36:03.040,00:36:06.600,"So, if the child loves something,
give them the freedom to pursue it."
00:36:05.131,00:36:14.130,大胆的让他去追求他做这个他会是全身心的投入孩子他会创造出真正的惊天动地的成绩,00:36:06.800,00:36:09.300,They will devote themselves to it.
00:36:14.131,00:36:15.840,你看我们一说教育啊,00:36:09.540,00:36:13.400,And they might do something amazing.
00:36:15.841,00:36:19.050,我都想说我再补充两句,00:36:13.940,00:36:18.160,"When we talk about education, I also feeling like saying more as well."
00:36:19.051,00:36:22.050,你说教育这个话题就是每个人都有共鸣,00:36:18.600,00:36:21.600,We all can relate to this topic.
00:36:22.051,00:36:23.700,咱下次要不要教育,,,
00:36:23.701,00:36:24.960,专门开个专场啊,00:36:21.880,00:36:25.600,We should have an episode on education some time.
00:36:24.961,00:36:26.160,张总坐一起,,,
00:36:26.161,00:36:28.110,但是最后我想表达一个观点,,,
00:36:28.111,00:36:28.980,就是啊,00:36:26.140,00:36:30.400,"Anyways, I just wanted to say that
there are still many students from poor families."
00:36:28.981,00:36:30.870,其实还有很多寒门子弟,,,
00:36:30.871,00:36:34.680,他们可能接受我们所谓的素质类的教育,00:36:30.600,00:36:37.200,"It might be difficult for them to receive ""quality-oriented""
or ""creativity-oriented"" education."
00:36:34.681,00:36:37.560,或者说更多的这种创意类的相对会比较难,,,
00:36:37.561,00:36:39.210,我觉得可能最理想的状态,00:36:37.380,00:36:40.460,"I think ideally, I'm just thinking out loud,"
00:36:39.211,00:36:42.690,我也只是一种脑洞大开就是素质的归宿纸,00:36:40.800,00:36:43.200,we support quality-oriented education
00:36:42.691,00:36:47.310,但是还是要给这样的一些孩子他们考试的机会,00:36:43.200,00:36:46.700,but still give some children the opportunity to focus on exams.
00:36:47.311,00:36:51.390,因为他们没有机会接触那些创造性很强的,00:36:47.160,00:36:53.500,"They may not be able to afford creativity-oriented
or personality-discovering programs,"
00:36:51.391,00:36:54.120,或者说这个很可以开发个性的,,,
00:36:54.121,00:36:58.140,但也许他们考试就是可以因为这个是他能够得到的教育方式,00:36:53.860,00:36:57.560,but they are good at exams from the education they receive
00:36:58.141,00:37:00.210,也是给可以给他们一条路,00:36:58.020,00:37:00.000,and this is their way to the future.
00:37:00.211,00:37:03.780,所以其实关于中国你看中国大有多大,00:37:00.000,00:37:03.600,"China, is a really big topic."
00:37:03.781,00:37:06.990,关于教育我们都可以弹出那么多不同的侧面,00:37:03.600,00:37:06.800,There're already so many aspects of education.
00:37:06.991,00:37:09.450,所以我们要去了解中国要去认知中国,00:37:06.800,00:37:11.800,We must have a well-rounded understanding of China as well.
00:37:09.451,00:37:12.360,真的是要非常非常全面的去看啊,,,
00:37:12.361,00:37:14.700,不同观点可以互相讨论辩论,00:37:12.100,00:37:15.220,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:37:16.380,00:37:18.840,我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:37:16.100,00:37:18.120,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:37:18.841,00:37:20.100,中国人你要自信,00:37:18.580,00:37:20.520,"China, be confident."
00:37:22.020,00:37:25.050,这就是中国青张维迎说,00:37:21.000,00:37:26.000,"China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:37:27.630,00:37:32.130,我们刚才这位蓝衣服的女孩子欢迎张教授好,00:37:27.000,00:37:30.000,"Yes, the girl in blue. Welcome."
00:37:32.131,00:37:34.470,我是来自新疆的哈萨克族,00:37:31.000,00:37:34.000,"Hello, Professor Zhang. I am a Kazakh student from Xinjiang."
00:37:34.471,00:37:36.420,我现在在南京读大三,00:37:34.240,00:37:36.340,I am now in my thrid year in a university in Nanjing.
00:37:36.421,00:37:38.730,今天专程是专门过来的,00:37:36.420,00:37:38.240,"- Did you make the trip just for our show?
- Yes, I did."
00:37:38.731,00:37:39.060,谢谢,00:37:38.240,00:37:39.600,Thank you for coming.
00:37:39.061,00:37:41.460,谢谢我在提问题之前呢,,,
00:37:41.461,00:37:46.800,我想阐明几个我队作为我这个新疆人的一些观点,00:37:39.700,00:37:46.400,"Before asking my question, I would like to
share some of my opinions about Xinjiang."
00:37:46.801,00:37:50.610,首先关于一些新疆发生的一系列的问题,00:37:46.600,00:37:50.300,"First of all, despite a series of problems that happened in Xinjiang,"
00:37:50.611,00:37:52.500,应将的经济和社会环境,,,
00:37:52.501,00:37:53.970,你现在是比较繁荣的,00:37:50.520,00:37:54.900,"Xinjiang's economic and social environment has prospered
and the people are able to live and work in peace."
00:37:53.971,00:37:55.260,人民安居乐业,,,
00:37:55.261,00:37:56.220,这几年来,,,
00:37:56.221,00:37:59.370,大家都是同舟共济,00:37:55.120,00:38:00.800,"Over the past few years, we have been in the same boat striving for this"
00:37:59.371,00:38:00.270,砥砺前行,,,
00:38:00.271,00:38:04.320,真的是这是很多人的血和泪换来的和平,00:38:01.120,00:38:05.700,"and it is truly... Peace, stability, and prosperity,
they are at the cost of the blood and tears of many."
00:38:04.321,00:38:05.520,安定,,,
00:38:05.521,00:38:10.740,繁荣可能繁荣程度可能比不上沿海或者是南方这样的地方,00:38:06.140,00:38:10.100,"Even though Xinjiang may not be as prosperous as
the costal or southern provinces,"
00:38:10.741,00:38:12.600,但是新疆真的是很不错,00:38:10.320,00:38:12.500,Xinjiang has been doing well.
00:38:12.601,00:38:15.780,在GDP方面在各方面都是没有垫底,00:38:12.500,00:38:15.500,"In terms of GDP and many other things, Xingjiang isn't among the lowest ranking regions."
00:38:15.781,00:38:17.580,没给祖国拖后腿,00:38:15.720,00:38:18.420,It didn't fall behind.
00:38:22.140,00:38:23.730,然后我本人呢,,,
00:38:23.731,00:38:24.990,是作为少数民族,00:38:22.000,00:38:27.200,"Myself, from an ethnic minority, I identify with the Chinese culture."
00:38:24.991,00:38:27.720,我是非常认可中国文化,,,
00:38:27.721,00:38:30.390,我是中国文化圈的一份子,00:38:27.640,00:38:30.540,I belong to the Chinese cultural sphere.
00:38:30.391,00:38:32.100,我是恩,00:38:31.920,00:38:33.880,"I speak Mandarin, and I use chopsticks."
00:38:32.101,00:38:36.570,我说汉语我用筷子说的很棒对,00:38:33.880,00:38:35.500,You speak very well.
00:38:36.571,00:38:41.040,然后现在就是刚才提到了西方话语权的问题,00:38:38.000,00:38:40.800,We were discussing the dominance of Western narratives.
00:38:41.041,00:38:43.620,这真的是一个很严重的问题,00:38:40.800,00:38:43.200,This is a really serious issue.
00:38:43.621,00:38:46.470,我就也有点有点,00:38:43.580,00:38:48.800,And I feel a little ... aggrieved.
00:38:47.730,00:38:54.840,心酸对然后还有就是新疆的发展的话,00:38:50.400,00:38:57.600,"And, I think, Xinjiang’s development, I think it's China's miracle."
00:38:54.841,00:38:58.290,我估计我觉得可以说是中国的奇迹,,,
00:38:58.291,00:38:59.010,中国的,,,
00:39:00.060,00:39:04.980,中国的一个发展的一个真的是一个体现,00:38:58.000,00:39:04.400,It’s ... It's an embodiment of China's growth.
00:39:04.981,00:39:07.200,兴靖江市真是越来越好,00:39:04.540,00:39:06.920,Xinjiang is doing better and better.
00:39:07.201,00:39:09.690,各族人民也真是团结,00:39:06.920,00:39:11.800,"And the people of all ethnic groups are united.
There's no ""we and they""."
00:39:09.691,00:39:12.270,真是不分你我的那种状态,,,
00:39:12.271,00:39:14.100,然后我想问的问题是,,,
00:39:14.101,00:39:18.870,您对新疆现在的这样的一个发展有什么看法,00:39:12.200,00:39:18.700,"My question is, what’s your opinion on
Xinjiang's current development?"
00:39:18.871,00:39:24.270,还有对这些误解偏见有什么看法太好了,00:39:18.860,00:39:22.700,"And what do you think about the
misunderstandings and biases against Xinjiang?"
00:39:24.271,00:39:24.660,这个,00:39:22.940,00:39:25.260,"- Great question.
- Please sit down."
00:39:28.380,00:39:32.280,我这个实际上今年去了一次,00:39:28.300,00:39:32.700,I have visited Xinjiang this year.
00:39:32.281,00:39:33.630,新疆,,,
00:39:33.631,00:39:35.790,新疆是个好地方,00:39:33.200,00:39:35.600,Xinjiang is always a good place to visit.
00:39:35.791,00:39:38.220,新疆经济发展的非常好,00:39:35.600,00:39:38.300,Xinjiang’s doing very well economically.
00:39:39.270,00:39:41.850,我有几点感受,00:39:39.200,00:39:41.080,I have a few things to say.
00:39:41.851,00:39:43.020,一个就是,,,
00:39:44.040,00:39:50.130,经过向七五这种恐怖主义事件这么大的一个恐怖支线之后,00:39:41.580,00:39:49.580,"One is that after the Urumqi 7.5 Incident,
after such a serious terrorist incident,"
00:39:50.131,00:39:55.170,采取一些特殊的措施来解决恐怖主义问题,00:39:49.800,00:39:54.700,we started to take special measures to counter terrorism.
00:39:55.171,00:39:57.780,我觉得是完全可以理解的,00:39:54.800,00:39:57.300,I think that is completely understandable.
00:39:57.781,00:40:00.240,放到任何国家都应该理解的,00:39:57.600,00:40:00.000,It should be understandable in any country.
00:40:00.241,00:40:01.530,第二就是,,,
00:40:01.531,00:40:04.950,无论是哈萨克族还是维吾尔族,00:40:00.000,00:40:07.780,"Another thing is that, Kazakhs or Uyghurs
or any other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,"
00:40:04.951,00:40:09.030,还有一些其他的新疆的少数民族,,,
00:40:09.031,00:40:10.200,实际上,,,
00:40:10.201,00:40:14.730,它的文化总体上是高度开放,00:40:08.640,00:40:13.840,their cultures are highly open overall.
00:40:14.731,00:40:15.060,那时候,,,
00:40:15.061,00:40:16.980,我们家少数民族能歌善舞,00:40:14.380,00:40:17.460,"We often say that ethnic minorities
are good at singing and dancing."
00:40:16.981,00:40:20.040,买女孩子的从来打扮的就是非常鲜艳,00:40:17.840,00:40:21.260,The girls are dressed colorfully and good at singing and dancing.
00:40:20.041,00:40:20.850,能歌善舞,,,
00:40:21.780,00:40:30.930,而且今年你看这个2018年我看到的数据好像到八月为止的时候,00:40:21.500,00:40:27.320,"The data I have shows that, by August 2018,"
00:40:30.931,00:40:35.100,新疆已经有了一亿人次的游客利益商,00:40:27.800,00:40:34.000,"Xinjiang received more than 100 million tourists,"
00:40:35.101,00:40:39.660,最多的时候就是这个是了不起的成绩,00:40:34.300,00:40:36.840,the largest number in its history.
00:40:39.661,00:40:41.670,就新疆是个非常安全的地方,00:40:37.200,00:40:41.300,This is an amazing achievement showing that Xinjiang is very safe now.
00:40:41.671,00:40:43.110,到哪里都可以去,00:40:41.300,00:40:43.460,You can go to anywhere you like.
00:40:44.100,00:40:49.020,我们去年九月份中国智库代表团到欧洲,00:40:44.000,00:40:48.500,"In September 2018, our thinktank delegation visited Europe,"
00:40:49.021,00:40:51.150,他们就提新疆问题,00:40:48.920,00:40:50.960,another delegation asked about Xinjiang.
00:40:51.151,00:40:51.840,哎我就说了,,,
00:40:51.841,00:40:53.160,我说我,,,
00:40:53.161,00:40:56.280,我知道今天用的都是自己的语言,00:40:50.960,00:40:57.240,"I said that the Uyghurs still speak their own
language and use their own script today."
00:40:56.281,00:40:59.490,自己的文字对少数民族权益的尊重,00:40:57.660,00:41:00.960,This is our respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.
00:41:01.200,00:41:01.620,我说,,,
00:41:01.621,00:41:05.310,我们代表团里的成员都是汉族人,00:41:01.000,00:41:04.900,"Even though the members of our delegation are all Han people,"
00:41:05.311,00:41:08.520,我每个人都会唱侮辱爱情的渴望,00:41:05.240,00:41:08.100,all of us can sing Uighur songs.
00:41:08.521,00:41:09.480,所以是我们严格,,,
00:41:09.481,00:41:11.970,咱可以给他们上课给他们启蒙,00:41:08.200,00:41:12.300,"So, strictly speaking, we can teach them a lesson and enlighten them."
00:41:18.060,00:41:18.420,谢谢,,,
00:41:18.421,00:41:20.760,张老师刚才这么多朋友的提问,00:41:17.800,00:41:19.420,"Thank you, Professor Zhang."
00:41:20.761,00:41:22.590,问的问题的侧重点,00:41:19.420,00:41:24.100,"Our friends in the audience had their own concerns
and asked different questions."
00:41:22.591,00:41:24.630,大家所关注的点都不一样,,,
00:41:24.631,00:41:26.730,但是我想我们就是这一个个侧面,00:41:24.500,00:41:28.460,"But I think we will be able to put all these pieces together,"
00:41:26.731,00:41:29.430,我们慢慢的慢慢的去拼,,,
00:41:29.431,00:41:30.630,慢慢的我们就会发现,,,
00:41:30.631,00:41:33.000,我们对中国的了解会越来越全面,00:41:28.780,00:41:32.580,and have a well-rounded understanding of China
00:41:33.001,00:41:36.150,我们自己对中国的认知也会越来越深刻,00:41:32.800,00:41:35.720,and a deeper understanding of China.
00:41:36.151,00:41:38.550,我们再次掌声送给张老师,00:41:35.800,00:41:38.200,One more round of applaud for Professor Zhang.
00:41:38.551,00:41:38.760,谢谢,,,
00:41:38.761,00:41:39.210,张老师,00:41:38.400,00:41:40.320,"Thank you, Professor Zhang."
