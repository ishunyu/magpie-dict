00:00:30.920,00:00:31.800,嗯,,,
00:00:32.280,00:00:33.240,嗯嗯嗯,,,
00:00:33.480,00:00:34.280,中国太大了,00:00:32.980,00:00:34.240,China is so large.
00:00:34.320,00:00:34.720,这个角度,00:00:34.240,00:00:35.180,Whether from this angle
00:00:34.720,00:00:35.760,看也是那个角度看,00:00:35.180,00:00:36.200,or another.
00:00:35.760,00:00:37.080,是就很容易产生,,,

[making biased judgment]"
00:00:38.600,00:00:40.480,你比如有像拿望远镜看的,00:00:38.780,00:00:40.320,Someone is viewing through a telescope
00:00:40.520,00:00:42.760,有的是拿那种就是透视镜去看,00:00:40.320,00:00:42.420,while others through spherical lenses.
00:00:42.800,00:00:45.040,你这个画面不是变大变小,00:00:42.420,00:00:44.980,The picture is either changing size
00:00:45.080,00:00:46.040,要么就是扭曲,00:00:44.980,00:00:45.980,or getting twisted.
00:00:46.040,00:00:47.880,他不是通过自己的眼睛看,00:00:46.040,00:00:47.760,He did not see through his own eyes.
00:00:47.920,00:00:50.080,因为他没有真正实际到中国来走,00:00:47.920,00:00:49.640,Because he has not practically
00:00:50.080,00:00:50.560,一走,00:00:49.640,00:00:50.660,come to China.
00:00:50.560,00:00:51.680,前两天我看到一句话,00:00:50.660,00:00:51.840,I read a quote the other day.
00:00:51.720,00:00:52.680,我觉得特别有道理,00:00:51.840,00:00:52.900,I think it makes sense.
00:00:52.720,00:00:54.320,他说中国那么大,00:00:52.900,00:00:54.200,China is so large.
00:00:54.320,00:00:56.160,你以为人尽皆知的事情,00:00:54.200,00:00:56.080,"What you think everyone knows,"
00:00:56.160,00:00:57.240,有可能还有13亿人,00:00:56.160,00:00:58.060,might be unknown to 1.3 billion people.
00:00:57.240,00:00:58.280,一人是不知道的,,,
00:00:58.320,00:00:59.000,嗯哼,00:00:58.140,00:00:58.940,Yes (laughs)
00:00:59.000,00:01:00.880,我觉得这个比喻非常形象,00:00:59.060,00:01:00.820,I think it’s a vivid metaphor.
00:01:00.920,00:01:01.560,不仅是国,00:01:00.820,00:01:02.080,"Not only the ordinary Chinese,"
00:01:01.600,00:01:01.880,国人,,,
00:01:01.920,00:01:03.280,中国的很多知识界的,00:01:02.080,00:01:03.700,but many intellectuals in China
00:01:03.280,00:01:03.840,很多人,,,
00:01:03.880,00:01:04.960,对中国完全不了解,00:01:03.700,00:01:05.020,have no idea about China at all.
00:01:04.960,00:01:06.760,比如说什么中等收入陷阱,00:01:05.120,00:01:06.700,"For instance, they worry about “middle-income trap”"
00:01:06.760,00:01:07.560,就以德陷阱,00:01:06.700,00:01:08.260,"and “Thucydides Trap” [tendency towards war between
emerging power and hegemon]"
00:01:07.560,00:01:08.760,我们看到现在他用的模式,,,
00:01:08.760,00:01:09.400,跟例子,,,
00:01:09.400,00:01:10.760,经验全是国外的,00:01:08.280,00:01:10.840,All the examples and models are from abroad.
00:01:10.800,00:01:11.640,关键还在于他,00:01:10.840,00:01:12.180,The key is whether one is willing to
00:01:11.680,00:01:13.200,愿不愿意把你当做一个,,,
00:01:13.200,00:01:14.320,发展程度不一,00:01:12.180,00:01:14.560,think of China as a country with unbalanced development
00:01:14.320,00:01:15.800,那么国家非常复杂的一个国家,00:01:14.560,00:01:16.400,and complicated national conditions.
00:01:15.840,00:01:17.120,去看待中国,,,
00:01:17.160,00:01:19.080,尽管这些年经济发展的,00:01:16.400,00:01:19.840,"China's economy has developed rapidly over the years,"
00:01:19.120,00:01:19.600,很快,,,
00:01:19.600,00:01:20.720,人均收入也在上升,00:01:19.840,00:01:21.380,"with per capita income also rising,"
00:01:20.720,00:01:22.360,但还是一个发展中国家,00:01:21.380,00:01:22.600,but China is still a developing country.
00:01:22.560,00:01:24.520,这个结论这个判断,00:01:22.660,00:01:23.820,This conclusion
00:01:24.520,00:01:25.920,和他的出发点相悖,00:01:23.820,00:01:26.000,is in conflict with their starting point
00:01:25.960,00:01:28.160,因为他认为你不是发展中国家,00:01:26.000,00:01:28.220,—they don't think China is a developing country.
00:01:28.240,00:01:30.400,就是一个心态的问题,00:01:28.220,00:01:30.320,It’s all about the mindset.
00:01:30.400,00:01:32.160,你面对未知事物的时候,00:01:30.380,00:01:32.240,"When facing the unknown,"
00:01:32.160,00:01:35.000,你是抱着想多了解他的心态去看,00:01:32.240,00:01:35.160,you either want to know more about it
00:01:35.080,00:01:37.080,还是说我先预设,00:01:35.160,00:01:38.480,or rely on your preconceived notions.
00:01:37.120,00:01:38.160,它是一种什么状态,,,
00:01:38.160,00:01:39.080,先把帽子给他带,00:01:38.480,00:01:39.600,Put a label on it first.
00:01:39.080,00:01:41.520,我在用我已知的东西网上去套哦,00:01:39.640,00:01:41.680,And then apply it with the known.
00:01:41.560,00:01:43.680,我摸到的这个好像是个图情噢,00:01:41.680,00:01:43.780,"For example, the thing I touched seemed to be a bump."
00:01:43.680,00:01:44.760,那就是鼻子,00:01:43.780,00:01:44.780,Then I said that's the nose.
00:01:44.800,00:01:46.120,其实它有可能是耳朵,00:01:44.920,00:01:46.300,"In fact, it might be an ear instead."
00:01:46.120,00:01:47.320,但问题是有的,00:01:46.380,00:01:48.760,But the problem is that some people
00:01:47.360,00:01:49.440,就真的就是闭着眼睛,00:01:48.760,00:01:50.160,just close their eyes and do not want to see.
00:01:50.040,00:01:51.680,愿不愿意不愿意,00:01:50.160,00:01:51.860,Then whether they are willing to
00:01:51.680,00:01:52.720,和我们探讨这个问题,00:01:51.980,00:01:53.100,discuss this problem with us.
00:01:52.760,00:01:55.680,我觉得其实还是要耐下心来去,00:01:53.100,00:01:56.140,"In fact, I think it is necessary to communicate patiently."
00:01:55.680,00:01:56.080,沟通,,,
00:01:56.120,00:01:56.840,方法很简单,00:01:56.140,00:01:56.860,There is an easy way.
00:01:56.840,00:01:57.960,开放旅游业就行了,00:01:56.920,00:01:58.060,Just open up tourism.
00:01:57.960,00:01:59.840,让他们先到中国实体来玩玩来,00:01:58.060,00:01:59.720,Let them first visit China themselves.
,,,00:01:59.720,00:02:00.420,Then they will see.
00:01:59.880,00:02:01.440,就知道不是有那个段子嘛,00:02:00.420,00:02:01.420,There is a joke that
00:02:01.600,00:02:02.760,说一个印度朋友说,00:02:01.420,00:02:02.520,an Indian friend says
00:02:02.800,00:02:03.360,我们印度人,,,
00:02:03.360,00:02:05.200,没有什么不能用手来吃的,00:02:02.520,00:02:05.220,Indians can eat anything by hand.
00:02:05.600,00:02:06.240,火锅试试,00:02:05.220,00:02:06.620,Then how about hot pot?
00:02:06.240,00:02:07.520,对主要幽默一点,,,
00:02:07.520,00:02:08.480,好像狠一点,00:02:06.760,00:02:09.260,"Although just being humorous and a little bit cruel,"
00:02:08.480,00:02:09.760,有效真的很有效,,,
00:02:09.760,00:02:11.360,其实我们仔细想一想啊,00:02:09.260,00:02:10.840,it really works.
00:02:11.360,00:02:12.640,40年前,00:02:10.940,00:02:12.360,"In fact, let's rethink this more carefully."
00:02:12.640,00:02:14.240,就改革开放之前的时候,00:02:12.360,00:02:14.280,"Forty years ago, before the reform and opening up,"
00:02:14.240,00:02:16.160,我们对于世界的这种判断,00:02:14.300,00:02:16.180,did we make an overall judgment of the world
00:02:16.320,00:02:18.160,有没有一点盲人摸象的意思,00:02:16.240,00:02:18.200,"like ""the blind men feeling the elephant""?"
00:02:18.160,00:02:19.160,对这主观对,00:02:18.200,00:02:19.420,"Yes, we also might have been subjective."
00:02:19.160,00:02:20.920,所以说我们就是一个过程,00:02:19.420,00:02:21.240,So we are going through that process.
00:02:20.920,00:02:22.840,我们自己唉逐渐越来越开放,00:02:21.240,00:02:24.020,"We are gradually becoming more and more
open and confident."
00:02:22.840,00:02:23.840,越来越自信,,,
00:02:23.880,00:02:25.880,我们对于世界的这种判断,00:02:24.540,00:02:26.180,And our judgment of the world
00:02:25.920,00:02:26.960,越来越,,,
00:02:27.000,00:02:28.480,基于最真实的那种状态,00:02:26.180,00:02:28.440,is getting closer to reality.
00:02:28.480,00:02:29.240,我倒是觉得,00:02:28.480,00:02:29.320,I do think that
00:02:29.240,00:02:31.000,现在一个比较重要的点,00:02:29.320,00:02:30.840,the more important point
00:02:31.000,00:02:31.680,是在于,,,
00:02:31.800,00:02:33.640,中国人自己对自己的认知,00:02:30.900,00:02:34.960,"lies in the self-awareness of Chinese
people being incomplete."
00:02:33.640,00:02:34.760,其实还不够,,,
00:02:34.800,00:02:36.080,我觉得很多焦虑,,,
00:02:36.080,00:02:38.440,就来自于对自己的不够了解,00:02:35.080,00:02:37.740,"I think a lot of anxiety comes from
the incomplete understanding of oneself."
,,,00:02:37.980,00:02:39.080,Not knowing enough about ourselves.
00:02:38.440,00:02:40.280,甚至就是说我们过去几十年,00:02:39.080,00:02:40.280,Even in the past few decades
00:02:40.280,00:02:42.000,我们很认真的睁开眼睛,00:02:40.400,00:02:41.940,We opened our eyes
00:02:42.040,00:02:43.320,在看这个世界,00:02:41.940,00:02:43.240,to look at the world very carefully.
00:02:43.440,00:02:45.200,但是我们都没有很好的,00:02:43.360,00:02:46.320,But we haven't studied ourselves very well.
00:02:45.200,00:02:46.440,去了解一下自己,,,
00:02:46.440,00:02:47.280,这个我倒是觉得,,,
00:02:47.280,00:02:47.640,接下来,00:02:46.320,00:02:48.880,"I think if we're like “the blind men feeling the elephant”,"
00:02:47.680,00:02:48.840,盲人摸象这一块,,,
00:02:48.840,00:02:49.920,也得把它摸准了,00:02:49.000,00:02:51.000,this is a part of the elephant that we must be clear about.
00:02:49.960,00:02:54.720,了谁知,,,
00:02:54.720,00:02:55.960,来继续注意,,,
00:02:56.000,00:02:57.760,这几年没跟我说起火了,,,
00:02:57.800,00:02:59.120,我谈到这个问题,,,
00:02:59.120,00:03:02.000,唉呀你过来我用上次就知道了,,,
00:03:02.000,00:03:02.800,嗯,,,
00:03:03.880,00:03:06.600,这个刚才跟这个观众聊了一下,00:03:04.760,00:03:06.840,I talked to the audience just now.
00:03:06.600,00:03:08.240,这个观众搜集的问题,00:03:06.840,00:03:09.320,They collected a lot of questions.
00:03:08.240,00:03:09.560,也是非常非常多,,,
00:03:09.600,00:03:10.240,谢谢,00:03:09.320,00:03:10.240,Sharp ones?
00:03:10.280,00:03:10.920,非常尖锐,00:03:10.240,00:03:11.020,Exactly.
00:03:10.920,00:03:12.640,他会直接来问这个,00:03:11.020,00:03:13.780,"They would ask Prof. Zhang directly,"
00:03:12.960,00:03:13.960,张老师这个,,,
00:03:14.120,00:03:16.560,什么时候统一早统好晚统好,00:03:13.860,00:03:15.360,when will China be reunified?
00:03:16.560,00:03:17.600,对于中国未来的,00:03:15.360,00:03:16.800,And the timing of the reunification
00:03:17.640,00:03:18.080,这个,,,
00:03:18.080,00:03:19.640,民族复兴的这个好处,00:03:16.900,00:03:21.140,"— will it be more beneficial to China's national
rejuvenation to reunify sooner or later?"
00:03:19.680,00:03:21.080,是早一点还是晚一点,,,
00:03:21.120,00:03:22.320,非常直接的,00:03:21.360,00:03:22.700,Quite straightforward.
00:03:22.360,00:03:25.000,你看他习近平主席十九大的报告,00:03:22.740,00:03:25.320,"In the 19th National Congress Report
by President Xi Jinping [2017],"
00:03:25.120,00:03:27.920,什么时候复兴时期都不行,00:03:25.320,00:03:27.400,the timing for national rejuvenation
00:03:27.960,00:03:28.680,很清楚吧,00:03:27.400,00:03:28.800,is clearly written.
00:03:28.680,00:03:31.120,其实关于盲人摸象,00:03:28.900,00:03:30.980,"Actually, about “Taking a Part for the Whole”,"
00:03:31.120,00:03:33.920,台湾是一个最典型的例子,00:03:31.100,00:03:33.560,Taiwan is the most typical example.
00:03:34.040,00:03:34.800,查一下,,,
00:03:35.240,00:03:36.440,差一代才难,00:03:34.040,00:03:35.940,They were talking about tea flavored boiled eggs.
00:03:36.480,00:03:37.520,他不是一个笑话,00:03:35.980,00:03:37.660,"Yeah, and that isn’t a joke."
00:03:37.560,00:03:39.080,我我的感觉是这样的,,,
00:03:39.120,00:03:41.600,月自称有新闻自由,00:03:37.880,00:03:43.120,"I feel that the more media freedom they claim to have,"
00:03:41.600,00:03:43.320,媒体自由的地方,,,
00:03:43.360,00:03:44.440,越无知,00:03:43.120,00:03:45.520,the more ignorant they are.
00:03:44.440,00:03:45.400,越越愚昧,,,
00:03:45.400,00:03:46.720,美国也是个典型,00:03:45.620,00:03:46.940,The United States is also a typical example.
00:03:46.720,00:03:47.520,老百姓,,,
00:03:47.520,00:03:48.720,根本是北京在哪里,00:03:46.940,00:03:50.120,"The Americans cannot even figure out
the location of Beijing and North Korea."
00:03:48.720,00:03:50.080,朝鲜哪里都搞不清楚,,,
00:03:50.080,00:03:50.800,对不对,00:03:50.240,00:03:51.140,Yeah.
00:03:51.200,00:03:52.040,对对对对,00:03:51.140,00:03:53.380,"All right, it’s time for the speech."
00:03:52.040,00:03:54.640,OK好好好好好好,00:03:53.380,00:03:54.300,Sure.
00:03:55.720,00:03:56.520,不同观点,,,
00:03:56.520,00:03:58.640,可以互相讨论辩论,00:03:56.200,00:03:58.500,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:03:59.880,00:04:01.960,就我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:03:59.820,00:04:01.960,We are not afraid of competition.
00:04:02.400,00:04:03.920,中国人你要自信,00:04:02.200,00:04:04.120,"China, be confident."
00:04:05.680,00:04:09.000,这就是中国听张维维说,00:04:05.240,00:04:09.100,China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:04:18.920,00:04:20.960,让我们一起在这里认识中国,00:04:18.820,00:04:20.420,"We are here to learn about China,"
00:04:20.960,00:04:21.640,读懂中国,00:04:20.500,00:04:22.020,"comprehend China, position China,"
00:04:21.640,00:04:22.320,定位中国,,,
00:04:22.320,00:04:23.880,也理解中国,00:04:22.140,00:04:23.980,and understand China.
00:04:24.080,00:04:24.920,站在我身边呢,00:04:23.980,00:04:24.980,Standing next to me

00:04:26.200,00:04:27.280,来自于复旦大学,,,
00:04:27.280,00:04:28.360,中国研究院的院长,00:04:26.380,00:04:29.040,"Prof. Zhang Weiwei, Director of
the China Institute of Fudan University."
00:04:28.360,00:04:29.160,张维维教授,,,

chance to talk with Prof. Zhang."
00:04:39.160,00:04:41.520,我们现场还有编前会小组的团队,00:04:39.160,00:04:41.920,"And also, our pre-production panel"

00:04:46.400,00:04:47.000,那接下来呢,00:04:46.480,00:04:48.040,"Now, I will give the stage"
00:04:47.040,00:04:49.320,让我们把时间先交给张教授,00:04:48.040,00:04:49.200,to Prof. Zhang.
00:04:49.320,00:04:50.000,欢迎,00:04:49.280,00:04:50.320,Welcome!
00:04:50.280,00:04:50.800,好,,,
00:04:54.440,00:04:56.240,这个读懂中国啊,00:04:54.620,00:04:57.740,It’s not easy to comprehend China.
00:04:56.240,00:04:57.840,是不太容易的事情,,,
00:04:57.840,00:04:59.920,因为这个国家太大,00:04:57.740,00:04:59.900,Because China is too large.
00:04:59.920,00:05:01.440,那么我老讲,,,
00:05:01.440,00:05:03.920,中国是一个超大型的国家,00:04:59.900,00:05:03.880,I always say that China is a mega-country.
00:05:04.160,00:05:07.080,如果你照这个人口规模来算的话,00:05:03.880,00:05:06.880,"If measured by the size of its population,"
00:05:07.080,00:05:10.360,大致上中国是100个普通欧洲,00:05:06.880,00:05:08.920,China roughly equals to
00:05:10.360,00:05:11.120,国家,00:05:08.920,00:05:12.840,a hundred European countries combined.
00:05:11.360,00:05:12.880,这个加在一起的规模,,,
00:05:13.000,00:05:13.760,因为你看一下,00:05:12.960,00:05:14.480,You can take a look at
00:05:13.760,00:05:16.080,欧洲一个国家的平均人口,00:05:14.560,00:05:15.920,the average population of a country in Europe.
00:05:16.400,00:05:19.040,大概是1400万左右啊,00:05:16.140,00:05:18.540,"It's about 14 million,"
00:05:19.040,00:05:21.560,那么中国是接近14亿,00:05:18.800,00:05:21.840,while China is near 1.4 billion.
00:05:22.000,00:05:23.320,所以读懂中国,00:05:22.000,00:05:23.860,"Therefore, when understanding China one often"
00:05:23.320,00:05:24.440,往往面临一个,,,
00:05:24.440,00:05:26.960,我们叫做盲人摸象的问题,00:05:23.860,00:05:26.660,"encounters a problem called
“blind men and an elephant”."
00:05:27.240,00:05:28.280,就每个人摸到的,,,
00:05:28.320,00:05:30.360,都是这个大象的一部分,00:05:26.980,00:05:30.100,Everyone only touches one part of an elephant.
00:05:30.360,00:05:31.680,摸到他的耳朵,00:05:30.280,00:05:31.780,"When you touch the ears,"
00:05:31.680,00:05:32.720,你说啊,,,
00:05:32.800,00:05:34.560,他就像一个大的扇子,00:05:31.840,00:05:34.580,you describe it as a big fan
00:05:34.600,00:05:36.080,你摸到像个鼻子,00:05:34.680,00:05:36.500,"When you touch the nose,"
00:05:36.120,00:05:38.640,就是像一个圆圆的这个圆筒啊,00:05:36.500,00:05:38.720,you say it’s like a round cylinder.
,,,00:05:38.820,00:05:39.860,Then how exactly
00:05:38.920,00:05:41.440,那么究竟如何能够把中国真的,00:05:40.020,00:05:41.340,can we understand China?
00:05:41.440,00:05:42.000,读懂,,,
00:05:42.040,00:05:43.040,首先啊,,,
00:05:43.040,00:05:43.800,你就面临一个,00:05:41.620,00:05:45.580,"Firstly, there's the issue about ""per capita""."
00:05:43.840,00:05:45.680,这个人均的问题,,,
00:05:46.000,00:05:47.680,我也是打个比方,00:05:45.920,00:05:47.360,For instance，
00:05:47.720,00:05:49.520,你比方说天气预报唉,00:05:47.420,00:05:49.560,the weather forecast today says that
00:05:49.760,00:05:52.440,你说这个今年新加坡啊,00:05:49.600,00:05:54.100,the average temperature in Singapore is 35 degrees.
00:05:52.480,00:05:54.080,平均温度35度,,,
00:05:54.320,00:05:56.360,那谁都都国家太小了,00:05:54.100,00:05:56.280,It is generally known that Singapore is small.
00:05:56.560,00:05:57.320,所以我查了一下,,,
00:05:57.360,00:05:57.840,新加坡,,,
00:05:57.880,00:06:00.360,大概是北京的1/23,00:05:56.280,00:06:00.440,"I have checked that the size of Singapore
is about a twenty-third of Beijing,"
00:06:00.360,00:06:02.200,唉上海的1/9,00:06:00.560,00:06:02.160,and one-ninth of Shanghai.
00:06:02.840,00:06:04.040,那么这个35度,,,
00:06:04.040,00:06:06.000,肯定是非常准确的啊,00:06:02.200,00:06:05.960,"So the 35 degrees in a weather forecast
must be quite accurate."
00:06:06.360,00:06:07.960,但你说这个中华人民共和国啊,,,
00:06:07.960,00:06:09.240,今年平均气温啊,00:06:06.200,00:06:11.600,"But if you say the average temperature today is 35
degrees in the People’s Republic of China,"
00:06:09.240,00:06:11.520,平均温度35度,,,
00:06:11.840,00:06:12.120,嗯,,,
00:06:12.400,00:06:13.840,谁都找不到感觉,00:06:11.960,00:06:13.540,no one can actually make sense of it.
00:06:13.840,00:06:15.880,因为这国家太大了啊,00:06:13.540,00:06:14.980,Because this country is too large.
00:06:15.880,00:06:18.200,你东北是这个冰封雪地的,00:06:14.980,00:06:20.160,"When the northeast is frozen in snow,
Hainan is still hot."
00:06:18.200,00:06:20.160,时候呃海南还是烈日炎炎,,,
00:06:20.480,00:06:22.800,那么房价也是另外一个问题,00:06:20.320,00:06:22.740,Another issue is the housing price.
00:06:22.840,00:06:24.200,大家都说房价贵,00:06:22.740,00:06:24.540,Everyone says that house prices are high.
00:06:24.240,00:06:25.760,唉但突然有个人站着,,,
00:06:25.760,00:06:26.720,说房价怎么贵啊,00:06:24.540,00:06:27.340,"But suddenly someone argues that
houses aren’t expensive."
00:06:26.720,00:06:28.040,我们去年城镇房价,,,
00:06:28.040,00:06:29.040,是平均是,,,
00:06:29.280,00:06:29.880,啊7000,,,
00:06:29.880,00:06:30.640,还是8000,00:06:27.340,00:06:32.660,"In their town, the average price last year was RMB 7000
or 8,000 per square meter. [about US$100 per sq feet]"
00:06:30.640,00:06:32.400,唉人民币一平米,,,
00:06:32.640,00:06:34.200,所以我觉得就是,00:06:32.660,00:06:35.740,"So I think, to understand China,"
00:06:34.280,00:06:35.720,呃怎么读懂中国,,,
00:06:35.720,00:06:37.760,也许我们在指标体系上啊,,,
00:06:37.760,00:06:39.480,要要做一点创新,00:06:35.740,00:06:39.840,we need add innovation into the indicator system.
00:06:39.760,00:06:41.400,这个你体育运动,00:06:39.860,00:06:41.640,"In sports competition,"
00:06:41.720,00:06:43.880,里边进行这个比较的时候,,,
00:06:43.880,00:06:44.400,对吧,00:06:41.860,00:06:46.520,"we have to classify different kinds of
champions and runner-ups."
00:06:44.400,00:06:45.320,冠军押金什么,,,
00:06:45.360,00:06:46.400,你要分分类的,,,
00:06:46.520,00:06:48.080,你拳击比方有重量级,00:06:46.520,00:06:49.040,"For instance, heavyweight and lightweight players
are separated in boxing."
00:06:48.080,00:06:49.280,轻量级等等,,,
00:06:49.560,00:06:51.640,那国与国之间的比较,,,
00:06:51.680,00:06:52.840,实际上比这个运动,00:06:49.240,00:06:56.060,"Actually, country-to-country competitions
are far more complicated than boxing."
00:06:52.880,00:06:54.360,比这种拳击要复杂,,,
00:06:54.360,00:06:56.000,100倍都不全,,,
00:06:56.040,00:06:58.200,所以你简单的用一些数据来比,00:06:56.120,00:06:58.580,"Therefore, when you just use some simple data,"
00:06:58.240,00:06:59.200,恐怕是有,,,
00:06:59.520,00:07:00.200,困难的,00:06:58.580,00:07:00.680,it’s hard to draw a conclusion.
00:07:00.960,00:07:01.600,那么另外呢,,,
00:07:01.640,00:07:03.440,就是我经常讲的,00:07:00.860,00:07:03.440,I often mention that
00:07:03.440,00:07:06.160,呃即使在GDP的计算方法上,00:07:03.520,00:07:07.980,"even the calculation of GDP has
two different standards."
00:07:06.200,00:07:07.680,也分成这个,,,
00:07:07.800,00:07:10.120,呃根据美元啊,,,
00:07:10.120,00:07:12.640,官方汇率的这种计算,00:07:08.260,00:07:12.760,"One is according to the official exchange rate of the US dollar,"
00:07:12.800,00:07:13.840,或者叫做,00:07:12.760,00:07:14.780,and the other is called
00:07:14.000,00:07:16.320,另外一种购买力评价的计算,00:07:14.780,00:07:16.400,calculation of purchasing power parity (PPP).
00:07:16.880,00:07:18.600,那么购买力评价计算,00:07:16.680,00:07:19.300,We know that the PPP calculation
00:07:18.600,00:07:19.920,大家知道就是看,,,
00:07:19.920,00:07:21.200,事实上你的货币,00:07:19.300,00:07:22.620,"looks at how many things the
currency can actually buy"
00:07:21.200,00:07:22.800,能够买到多少东西,,,
00:07:22.880,00:07:25.640,然后来这个超出这个,,,
00:07:26.200,00:07:28.000,美元官方汇率这种,00:07:22.840,00:07:29.760,"and nominally compare to how it exceeds the
exchange rate of the official US dollar."
00:07:28.120,00:07:29.640,呃名义上的,,,
00:07:29.920,00:07:30.880,这种比较,,,
00:07:31.000,00:07:32.200,啊我个人一直认为,00:07:30.680,00:07:32.900,"Personally, I have always believed that"
00:07:32.200,00:07:35.400,恐怕是这个购买力评价更加准确,00:07:33.040,00:07:35.660,PPP is more accurate
00:07:35.400,00:07:35.760,一点,,,
00:07:35.760,00:07:36.920,我走了100多个国家,00:07:35.660,00:07:37.100,I have traveled to more than a hundred countries.
00:07:36.920,00:07:39.360,就这个相对而言更加靠谱一点,00:07:37.100,00:07:38.160,"and relatively speaking,"
00:07:39.560,00:07:40.640,但也有学者不同意,00:07:38.160,00:07:39.400,I think PPP is more reliable.
00:07:40.640,00:07:42.200,认为孩子用官方汇率更好,00:07:39.400,00:07:42.400,"But some scholars think that it's better
to use the official exchange rate."
00:07:42.240,00:07:43.080,但这没有关系,00:07:42.400,00:07:43.360,But it’s all right.
00:07:43.120,00:07:45.600,反正都是读懂真相的方法之一,00:07:43.400,00:07:45.760,Both of them are simply one of the ways to get to the truth.
00:07:46.480,00:07:47.000,那么,,,
00:07:47.160,00:07:49.400,我们这个经济总量很高,00:07:46.220,00:07:49.180,"Our economic aggregate is very large,"
00:07:49.400,00:07:52.120,但是人均GDP还比较低,00:07:49.180,00:07:52.100,but per capita GDP is still lagging behind.
00:07:52.400,00:07:53.600,这种解读方法呢,,,
00:07:53.600,00:07:55.080,也面临一些挑战,00:07:52.220,00:07:55.200,This kind of interpretation actually faces some challenges.
00:07:55.400,00:07:56.400,一个挑战就是,,,
00:07:56.480,00:07:57.400,是呃我们,00:07:55.320,00:07:58.480,One is from our social indicators.
00:07:57.760,00:07:58.760,的社会指标呃,,,
00:07:58.760,00:08:00.880,总体上还是不错的,00:07:58.680,00:08:00.980,"Actually, it’s good on the whole."
00:08:00.920,00:08:01.960,你比方说,00:08:00.980,00:08:01.920,"For example,"
00:08:02.000,00:08:02.960,是啊,,,
00:08:03.160,00:08:06.000,中国人的这个中位家庭净资产中,00:08:01.920,00:08:06.420,"China’s level of median household net worth,"
00:08:06.000,00:08:07.080,位水平啊,,,
00:08:07.120,00:08:08.320,特别在我们发达板块,00:08:06.600,00:08:08.440,"especially in our developed cities,"
00:08:08.360,00:08:08.680,人口,,,
00:08:08.680,00:08:09.960,已经超过美国了,00:08:08.440,00:08:09.840,has surpassed the United States.
00:08:10.240,00:08:11.640,这跟美国是和欧洲,00:08:09.940,00:08:12.440,This is comparable to the United States and Europe.
00:08:11.640,00:08:12.440,都是可以比的,,,
00:08:12.480,00:08:14.000,不落后于他们,00:08:12.560,00:08:13.880,We do not lag behind.
00:08:14.080,00:08:14.560,那么就是说,,,
00:08:14.560,00:08:17.120,老百姓的家底是比较丰厚,00:08:14.040,00:08:17.220,It shows that Chinese people are living in wealth.
00:08:17.160,00:08:19.520,有一个图表大家可以看一下的,00:08:17.220,00:08:19.320,There is a chart. You can take a look.
00:08:19.520,00:08:20.840,你比方说这个,00:08:19.320,00:08:21.900,This blue curve
00:08:20.880,00:08:22.360,蓝色这个曲线,,,
00:08:22.360,00:08:25.480,它表示的是美国中产,,,
00:08:25.840,00:08:26.440,阶级,00:08:21.900,00:08:29.780,"represents the median level of the
family net assets of the American middle-class."
00:08:26.440,00:08:28.080,家庭净资产,,,
00:08:28.360,00:08:29.760,中位水平的变化,,,
00:08:30.080,00:08:32.000,唉下边跟灰色的曲线呢,00:08:30.280,00:08:32.360,The gray curve below shows
00:08:32.000,00:08:34.320,表示的是美国老百姓家庭的,,,
00:08:34.320,00:08:37.480,中位净资产的这个曲线变化,00:08:32.360,00:08:37.360,"the changes of median net assets
in all American households."
00:08:37.680,00:08:39.480,那么两者的最高峰,00:08:37.420,00:08:41.420,The two both peaked in 2007.
00:08:39.480,00:08:41.280,都在2007年,,,
00:08:41.760,00:08:44.040,然后就赶上08年的金融危机,00:08:41.480,00:08:45.460,"Then just fell with the emergence of the
2008 financial crisis."
00:08:44.040,00:08:45.360,那就跌了,,,
00:08:45.800,00:08:48.600,那么到2013年的时候,00:08:45.620,00:08:47.120,"By 2013,"
00:08:48.600,00:08:51.160,美国中产阶级家庭的中位净资产,00:08:47.120,00:08:51.020,"the median net assets in a
middle-class American family"
00:08:51.200,00:08:52.520,"122,000美元",00:08:51.020,00:08:52.860,"was $122,000."
00:08:53.800,00:08:55.160,那么美国家庭的,00:08:53.540,00:08:55.980,Then the median net assets of American households
00:08:55.400,00:08:55.840,中位净资产,,,
00:08:55.840,00:08:57.000,当然就更低了,00:08:55.980,00:08:57.220,"should be even lower,"
00:08:57.000,00:08:58.720,"是72,000美元",00:08:57.300,00:08:58.800,"which was $72,000."
00:08:59.120,00:09:00.200,如果说我们,,,
00:09:00.320,00:09:01.680,把美国这个指标,00:08:59.080,00:09:03.980,"If we take $122,000 as a cap, and $72,000 a lower limit."
00:09:01.720,00:09:02.760,一个作为上限,,,
00:09:02.760,00:09:04.080,一个作为下限的话,,,
00:09:04.560,00:09:05.640,那么折成人民币,00:09:03.980,00:09:05.860,"Converted to RMB,"
00:09:05.640,00:09:07.120,也就是50万元,,,
00:09:07.160,00:09:08.640,到84万元,00:09:05.860,00:09:09.400,"that is about 500,000 yuan and 850,000 yuan."
00:09:08.640,00:09:09.960,这样一个水平,,,
00:09:09.960,00:09:11.560,就包括房产啊,00:09:09.560,00:09:11.800,These are including real estates.
00:09:11.800,00:09:14.560,呃我想大家根据自己的常识判断,00:09:11.800,00:09:15.160,"Based on common sense, I think everyone"
00:09:14.560,00:09:15.800,都可以大概知道,,,
00:09:15.800,00:09:16.920,就是拿到中国,00:09:15.160,00:09:18.600,probably knows China's current level [of net assets].
00:09:16.960,00:09:18.840,现在是一个什么样的水平,,,
00:09:19.040,00:09:21.520,实际上这些数据全是公开的,00:09:18.880,00:09:21.740,"Actually, all this data is open to the public,"
00:09:21.520,00:09:23.240,我们很多学者用都不敢用,00:09:21.740,00:09:23.460,but many of our scholars are afraid to use it.
00:09:23.280,00:09:24.920,他不敢相信啊,,,
00:09:24.920,00:09:27.000,中国人怎么可以比美国人富裕,00:09:23.460,00:09:26.920,"They can’t believe that Chinese people
should be richer than Americans."
00:09:27.240,00:09:28.720,你知道在美国生活过,00:09:26.960,00:09:28.420,"If you have lived in the US,"
00:09:28.760,00:09:29.720,这个这是个常识判断,00:09:28.420,00:09:29.780,you will know it’s a consensus that
00:09:29.760,00:09:32.000,很多中国人比美国人生活的好,00:09:29.780,00:09:31.840,many Chinese live better than Americans.
00:09:32.720,00:09:33.680,那么,,,
00:09:33.880,00:09:35.480,另外呢就是一个指标,00:09:32.780,00:09:35.520,"There is another social indicator,"
00:09:35.480,00:09:36.360,我觉得很重要,00:09:35.600,00:09:36.660,which I deem important.
00:09:36.400,00:09:37.040,社会指标,,,
00:09:37.040,00:09:39.120,人均预期寿命啊,00:09:36.660,00:09:38.320,The average life expectancy.
00:09:39.320,00:09:40.960,我这也有一张图表,00:09:39.060,00:09:41.440,I have another chart.
00:09:40.960,00:09:43.520,就是你可以看这个深蓝色的,00:09:41.440,00:09:43.540,You can look at the dark blue areas.
00:09:43.520,00:09:44.680,就是北京,,,
00:09:44.680,00:09:45.400,天津,00:09:43.540,00:09:47.040,"Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Zhejiang"
00:09:45.400,00:09:46.200,上海,,,
00:09:46.200,00:09:47.040,浙江,,,
00:09:47.400,00:09:49.320,都是80多岁唉,00:09:47.040,00:09:49.060,have the average life expectancy around 80.
00:09:49.520,00:09:51.600,就超过美国美国是79岁,00:09:49.220,00:09:51.320,It has already exceeded America which is 79.
00:09:51.680,00:09:52.520,啊这4个地方,,,
00:09:52.520,00:09:52.960,北京,00:09:51.320,00:09:54.580,"When adding up the population of these four regions
— Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhejiang"
00:09:52.960,00:09:53.280,天津,,,
00:09:53.320,00:09:53.680,上海,,,
00:09:53.720,00:09:54.760,浙江加在一起,,,
00:09:54.800,00:09:56.760,人口是1亿5000万啊,00:09:54.580,00:09:56.940,The population is 150 million.
00:09:57.200,00:09:59.280,那么下边这个蓝颜色的地方呢,00:09:57.080,00:09:58.960,The blue area below
00:09:59.280,00:10:02.960,是人均预计寿命是77岁到80,00:09:58.960,00:10:03.480,"indicates the life expectancy 77 to 80 years old,"
00:10:02.960,00:10:03.520,岁,,,
00:10:03.960,00:10:06.400,也就是说跟美国的79岁,00:10:03.480,00:10:07.920,"which is still comparable to 79-year-old
in the United States."
00:10:06.640,00:10:07.920,是不相上下的,,,
00:10:08.680,00:10:10.440,你把这个深蓝色或者蓝色,00:10:08.160,00:10:12.320,The population in the dark blue and the blue areas altogether
00:10:10.440,00:10:11.200,这两个板块,,,
00:10:11.200,00:10:12.560,加在一起的话,,,
00:10:12.560,00:10:13.920,人口是5亿多,00:10:12.360,00:10:13.960,is over 500 million.
00:10:14.440,00:10:16.120,也就5亿多的人口的,,,
00:10:16.160,00:10:17.200,这个人均寿命,00:10:14.280,00:10:18.280,"That is to say, more than 500 million people’s life expectancy in China"
00:10:17.200,00:10:18.760,实际上已经是,,,
00:10:19.000,00:10:20.640,跟美国很接近,00:10:18.280,00:10:21.920,"is actually very close to that in America,"
00:10:20.640,00:10:21.600,或者是差不多,,,
00:10:21.600,00:10:22.920,或者超过美国,00:10:21.920,00:10:23.160,or even higher.
00:10:23.320,00:10:25.480,另外还有一个重要的社会指标,00:10:23.320,00:10:24.700,"And another important social indicator,"
00:10:25.520,00:10:26.800,是社会治安,00:10:24.700,00:10:26.760,is public security.
00:10:27.240,00:10:28.760,那么中国的这个社会治安,,,
00:10:28.800,00:10:31.120,是公认的世界上最好的之一,00:10:26.760,00:10:31.120,"China’s public security is recognized as one of the
best in the world."
00:10:31.120,00:10:32.920,就是我这用了一个表格,00:10:31.120,00:10:32.640,This chart here.
00:10:32.960,00:10:34.400,大家可以图表明暗,00:10:32.640,00:10:33.780,You can take a look.
00:10:34.520,00:10:37.120,就是涉及到人命的案件,00:10:33.780,00:10:36.940,"Crime involving death per 100 thousand population in China [0.62],"
00:10:37.200,00:10:39.040,中国是世界最低的之一,00:10:36.940,00:10:39.240,is one of the lowest in the world.
00:10:39.040,00:10:40.760,大大低于美国,00:10:39.240,00:10:40.640,And much lower than the United States [5.53].
00:10:40.760,00:10:43.120,那如果讲的是呃一些,00:10:40.780,00:10:43.000,When it comes to
00:10:43.160,00:10:44.600,经济社会方面进一步,00:10:43.060,00:10:44.480,"economic and social progress,"
00:10:44.600,00:10:46.200,还有一个比较综合性的指标,00:10:44.480,00:10:46.080,there is a more comprehensive indicator.
00:10:46.200,00:10:47.760,就是呃问老百姓,00:10:46.080,00:10:47.920,Just ask the people:
00:10:47.760,00:10:49.240,你对自己国家的,,,
00:10:49.240,00:10:51.120,现在状况满意不满意,00:10:47.920,00:10:51.020,"are you satisfied with the current situation
in your country?"
00:10:51.400,00:10:53.520,唉经济状况满意不满意,00:10:51.020,00:10:53.480,With the economic status?
00:10:53.520,00:10:55.480,或者再问你对世界国家发展道路,00:10:53.480,00:10:54.540,Or ask in another way:
00:10:55.520,00:10:56.200,满意不满意,00:10:54.540,00:10:56.180,"are you satisfied with your country's
path of development?"
00:10:56.200,00:10:57.440,是比较主观的问题,00:10:56.260,00:10:57.480,These are all very subjective.
00:10:57.440,00:10:58.840,它很能说明问题的,00:10:57.480,00:10:58.740,But it is very telling.
00:10:59.120,00:10:59.680,一个图标,00:10:58.740,00:11:00.240,Look at the chart here.
00:10:59.680,00:11:03.080,你看这个现在评优中心的民调,00:11:00.240,00:11:02.980,The latest polls at the Pew Center
00:11:03.520,00:11:05.440,在中国对经济现状,00:11:03.040,00:11:07.780,"reveals that the dissatisfaction rate with
the economic situation in China is 11%;"
00:11:05.440,00:11:07.920,不满意的是11%,,,
00:11:08.360,00:11:09.080,那么有些国家,,,
00:11:09.080,00:11:10.040,法国,00:11:08.020,00:11:10.960,"while in some countries like France and Greece,"
00:11:10.200,00:11:10.760,希腊,,,
00:11:10.760,00:11:12.920,那都是百分之80多,00:11:10.960,00:11:14.640,the rate is over 80% and 90%.
00:11:12.920,00:11:14.440,90多唉,,,
00:11:14.960,00:11:16.040,那么我举这些例子,,,
00:11:16.040,00:11:17.040,想说明什么,,,
00:11:17.040,00:11:17.960,就是,00:11:14.860,00:11:19.980,"By giving these examples,
I want to probe towards the following question:"
00:11:18.120,00:11:19.160,呃我们要,,,
00:11:19.200,00:11:20.400,解释这么一个问题,,,
00:11:20.400,00:11:23.400,为什么中国人均GDP,00:11:19.980,00:11:27.060,"Why is China's GDP per capita not very high,
according to the official exchange rate statistics,"
00:11:23.600,00:11:25.520,根据官方汇率统计,,,
00:11:25.960,00:11:27.520,并不是十分高,,,
00:11:27.640,00:11:29.360,但是我们的社会指标,,,
00:11:29.360,00:11:32.360,和百姓的满意度总体,00:11:27.380,00:11:33.260,"but our social indicators and the overall
degree of satisfaction of the people"
00:11:32.600,00:11:34.280,呃在国际比较中,,,
00:11:34.280,00:11:35.600,还是比较高的,00:11:33.460,00:11:35.660,"are still relatively high
in an international comparison."
00:11:35.880,00:11:37.560,我就有几种解释,00:11:35.660,00:11:37.420,"I have several explanations,"
00:11:37.560,00:11:38.120,一种解释,,,
00:11:38.120,00:11:39.520,我说这正好证明了,,,
00:11:39.520,00:11:41.680,我们制度的优越性,00:11:37.420,00:11:41.660,"and one of which verifies
the superiority of our political system."
00:11:42.000,00:11:44.680,我比较喜欢比较就是纽约和上海,00:11:41.920,00:11:44.740,I always like to compare New York with Shanghai.
00:11:44.680,00:11:45.400,因为这两个城市,,,
00:11:45.440,00:11:46.640,我非常熟悉,00:11:44.740,00:11:46.700,Because these two cities are both familiar to me.
00:11:46.640,00:11:48.880,官方汇率的计算的话,00:11:46.700,00:11:48.820,"According to the official exchange rate,"
00:11:49.000,00:11:50.800,纽约的人均GDP,,,
00:11:50.840,00:11:52.120,最保守的估计,00:11:48.980,00:11:54.140,"New York's GDP per capita is at least
four times higher than Shanghai’s."
00:11:52.160,00:11:53.720,都比上海高4倍,,,
00:11:54.560,00:11:57.360,但是你看这个关键的社会指标,00:11:54.380,00:11:57.040,"But when it comes to some key social indicators,"
00:11:57.480,00:12:00.240,无论是这个人均家庭净资产,00:11:57.320,00:12:00.100,"like the median household net worth,"
00:12:00.720,00:12:02.560,呃人均预期寿命,00:12:00.440,00:12:03.920,"life expectancy per capita, public security,"
00:12:02.880,00:12:04.080,社会治安,,,
00:12:04.400,00:12:05.840,或者说多数,00:12:04.220,00:12:07.660,or the polls indicating whether most of the residents
00:12:06.080,00:12:07.160,这两个城市居民,,,
00:12:07.160,00:12:09.400,对自己城市未来是否乐观,,,
00:12:09.560,00:12:10.880,你看到的民调,00:12:07.820,00:12:13.920,"are optimistic about the future of the city,
Shanghai is significantly better than New York."
00:12:11.080,00:12:14.000,这个上海都明显的好于纽约,,,
00:12:14.720,00:12:15.800,另外你也可以看到,00:12:14.600,00:12:16.060,You can also see that
00:12:15.800,00:12:18.600,就是呃街上这个开着车,00:12:16.060,00:12:18.780,the cars on the street in Shanghai
00:12:18.600,00:12:20.680,像上海比纽约的要好,00:12:18.800,00:12:20.800,are actually better than that in New York.
00:12:20.800,00:12:22.560,这个老百姓的手机,00:12:20.840,00:12:24.060,"Meanwhile, Shanghai’s residents also use
better mobile phones,"
00:12:22.640,00:12:24.040,也比你们越来越好,,,
00:12:24.040,00:12:25.320,那家里的电器,,,
00:12:25.360,00:12:26.720,也比你们越来越好,00:12:24.220,00:12:28.500,as well as household appliances and so on.
00:12:27.000,00:12:28.600,那个诸如此类,,,
00:12:28.600,00:12:29.400,所以我觉得,00:12:28.680,00:12:29.640,"So I think,"
00:12:29.440,00:12:29.440,呃,,,
00:12:29.440,00:12:31.800,我们可以得出这么一个结论,00:12:29.660,00:12:31.800,we can draw such a conclusion:
00:12:31.800,00:12:34.000,就是尽管我们人均GDP,00:12:31.820,00:12:35.960,"although our GDP per capita
is only a quarter or even less [than America’s],"
00:12:34.000,00:12:35.120,只有你的1/4,,,
00:12:35.120,00:12:36.280,甚至不到,,,
00:12:36.360,00:12:38.160,但是我这个制度,00:12:36.160,00:12:38.060,"our political system,"
00:12:38.160,00:12:39.440,中国特色社会制度啊,00:12:38.100,00:12:39.720,"the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,"
00:12:39.440,00:12:41.080,至少在上海,,,
00:12:41.160,00:12:42.800,或者中国的发达板块,00:12:39.840,00:12:45.980,"is quite successful, at least in Shanghai,
or the developed areas in China."
00:12:43.200,00:12:45.560,这应该说是相当之成功,,,
00:12:45.560,00:12:47.960,来做到你根本做不到的事情,00:12:45.980,00:12:48.120,China did what the United States could not do.
00:12:48.240,00:12:49.280,另外还有一种解读,,,
00:12:49.280,00:12:51.440,我觉得也是蛮重要的,00:12:48.160,00:12:52.240,"There is another interpretation,
which I also deem important."
00:12:51.440,00:12:54.600,就是除了我们可能确实是有制度,,,
00:12:54.600,00:12:55.840,方面的这个,00:12:52.240,00:12:58.300,"Besides our obvious advantages in the political system,"
00:12:56.160,00:12:58.040,明显的优势之外,,,
00:12:58.040,00:13:00.160,呃GDP的计算方法,00:12:58.340,00:13:01.960,"there are some problems with the
method of calculating GDP."
00:13:00.640,00:13:02.040,是有一些问题,,,
00:13:02.040,00:13:05.160,呃至少说是跟美国人用的方法,00:13:02.080,00:13:06.700,At least we use different methods from America's.
00:13:05.400,00:13:06.600,不完全一样,,,
00:13:06.880,00:13:09.240,那我们农村有大量的经济活动,00:13:06.780,00:13:09.380,"There is a lot of economic activity
in our rural areas that is not counted."
00:13:09.640,00:13:12.440,呃我老说我们的过去40年,00:13:09.520,00:13:12.760,"I always said that during our reform and opening up in the past 40 years,"
00:13:12.440,00:13:12.760,改革开放,,,
00:13:12.760,00:13:14.720,我们农民兄弟的房子,,,
00:13:14.880,00:13:16.760,从土房变砖房,00:13:12.760,00:13:18.860,"farmers' mud houses all turned into brick houses,
tile-roofed houses, or multi-storey buildings."
00:13:16.760,00:13:18.680,啊变瓦房变楼房,,,
00:13:19.040,00:13:20.640,如果你去一些地方,00:13:18.960,00:13:20.960,"If you go to the countryside,"
00:13:20.680,00:13:22.800,呃我们农民兄弟有一些啊,,,
00:13:22.800,00:13:25.760,这个这个还在这个这个重楼啊,00:13:20.960,00:13:25.300,"you’ll see some of the people are still ""planting houses"","
00:13:25.760,00:13:28.040,他们希望以后这个拆迁,00:13:25.360,00:13:30.280,"in order to get more compensation
for land requisition in the future."
00:13:28.040,00:13:28.800,这个征地款,,,
00:13:28.800,00:13:30.640,是能够多拿到一点啊,,,
00:13:30.800,00:13:32.360,等等很多这些活动,,,
00:13:32.360,00:13:33.920,实际上没有算进去,00:13:30.940,00:13:33.960,Many of these activities are not actually counted.
00:13:34.120,00:13:36.160,我们呃城市里边,00:13:33.960,00:13:36.060,"In the city,"
00:13:36.160,00:13:36.920,大家都注意到,,,
00:13:36.920,00:13:38.480,很多街头小贩,00:13:36.060,00:13:38.580,you can notice that there are many street vendors.
00:13:38.480,00:13:40.880,唉这个这很大的一个产业链,00:13:38.620,00:13:41.080,This is a big industrial chain.
00:13:41.360,00:13:43.200,我们也不进入统计范围的,00:13:41.200,00:13:43.640,But these are not actually counted either.
00:13:43.200,00:13:44.280,啊,,,
00:13:44.280,00:13:46.120,我们叫做放水养鱼,00:13:44.140,00:13:45.960,"We call it ""giving the fish more water than they need""."
00:13:46.120,00:13:47.760,可能有城管去管一管,00:13:45.960,00:13:48.140,Sometimes the city management officers will interfere.
00:13:48.360,00:13:51.160,那么这个在国外他是都统计的,00:13:48.300,00:13:51.060,But this kind of business activity is counted abroad.
00:13:51.160,00:13:52.640,呃你像到意大利,,,
00:13:52.640,00:13:54.520,他连这个贩毒,00:13:51.100,00:13:56.340,"For example, in Italy, even drug trafficking and prostitution,"
00:13:54.760,00:13:56.200,这个这个卖淫,,,
00:13:56.240,00:13:57.320,这种非正式经济,,,
00:13:57.320,00:13:58.720,它全部算进去的,00:13:56.340,00:13:58.760,"these kinds of informal business, are also counted."
00:13:59.200,00:14:02.040,所以我想总体上我个人的感觉啊,00:13:59.000,00:14:01.480,"So I think overall,"
00:14:02.040,00:14:04.320,可能我们的这个统计方法,00:14:01.740,00:14:04.280,"our statistical method,"
00:14:04.400,00:14:05.520,由于种种原因,00:14:04.280,00:14:05.440,"due to many reasons,"
00:14:05.560,00:14:07.960,对我们自己的GDP有所低估,00:14:05.600,00:14:08.220,results in underestimating our own GDP.
00:14:08.120,00:14:09.880,那也是一家之言啊,00:14:08.220,00:14:09.900,This is just my personal opinion.
00:14:10.840,00:14:11.520,那么,,,
00:14:11.960,00:14:13.240,呃我有时候在想,00:14:10.660,00:14:15.460,"Sometimes, I also think about
a more fundamental question:"
00:14:13.240,00:14:15.600,就是一个更大的问题是,,,
00:14:16.040,00:14:18.520,怎么从西方的这个指标体系中,00:14:15.720,00:14:19.340,how to jump out from the Western indicator system?
00:14:18.520,00:14:19.440,解放出来,,,
00:14:19.440,00:14:21.160,有很多这个指标,,,
00:14:21.160,00:14:24.280,是在西方社会这个实践中,00:14:19.340,00:14:24.460,"Many western indicators are from their social practice,"
00:14:24.280,00:14:25.480,或者西方的,,,
00:14:25.840,00:14:27.480,呃自己的理论中,00:14:24.460,00:14:29.000,or from their own theories.
00:14:27.520,00:14:29.280,这个产生的,,,
00:14:29.280,00:14:31.440,实际上用到其他国家用到中国,00:14:29.020,00:14:31.440,"Therefore, when these indicators are
applied in other countries, like China,"
00:14:31.440,00:14:34.360,往往会导致各种各样的误读,00:14:31.440,00:14:34.380,it would often result in misreading [the situation].
00:14:34.680,00:14:36.920,比方有一个指标有基尼系数,00:14:34.380,00:14:36.800,"Take the ""Gini coefficient"" as an example.
[a statistical measure of income inequality]"
00:14:37.240,00:14:38.480,那么基尼系数,,,
00:14:38.480,00:14:40.360,究竟能不能准确的读懂中国,00:14:36.800,00:14:40.680,Can the Gini coefficient accurately interpret China?
00:14:40.360,00:14:41.880,我们知道基尼系数,,,
00:14:41.920,00:14:43.440,它有个比例的数值,00:14:40.720,00:14:45.680,"We know the scale value of the Gini coefficient
is between 0 and 1."
00:14:43.440,00:14:45.400,就0和1之间,,,
00:14:45.640,00:14:47.040,一般把0.4啊,,,
00:14:47.080,00:14:50.600,作为一个就是贫富差距的警戒线,00:14:45.680,00:14:50.660,"Normally, 0.4 is regarded as a warning line of the gap
between the rich and the poor."
00:14:50.800,00:14:51.920,大于这个数值,,,
00:14:51.960,00:14:54.160,容易出现社会动荡,00:14:50.720,00:14:54.200,"Once the value is greater than 0.4,
it’s likely to cause social unrest."
00:14:54.280,00:14:54.920,很多人认为,,,
00:14:54.920,00:14:55.880,中国的基尼系数,,,
00:14:55.880,00:14:57.640,超过了0.47,00:14:54.320,00:14:57.580,"Many people think that the Gini coefficient
in China is over 0.47."
00:14:58.440,00:15:00.440,但是你仔细看一下,,,
00:15:00.440,00:15:02.840,这个基尼系数的定义,00:14:57.960,00:15:03.020,"But if you look at the definition of the Gini coefficient,"
00:15:03.160,00:15:04.240,它计算的是,00:15:03.020,00:15:05.240,it actually calculates
00:15:04.240,00:15:06.360,就是英文叫做曼内塔,,,
00:15:06.360,00:15:08.320,应靠货币化的收入,00:15:05.240,00:15:08.760,the monetized income.
00:15:09.200,00:15:10.640,那么用货币化的收入,,,
00:15:10.680,00:15:12.720,来谈论中国,00:15:08.980,00:15:14.980,"Is it accurate or not to talk about China
with respect to ""monetized income""?"
00:15:12.720,00:15:14.600,究竟准确不准确,,,
00:15:14.600,00:15:15.240,对吧,,,
00:15:15.560,00:15:16.240,因为实际上,,,
00:15:16.240,00:15:17.600,我们是社会主义国家,00:15:15.160,00:15:17.860,"Because in fact, we are socialist countries."
00:15:17.600,00:15:18.640,经过土地改革,00:15:17.860,00:15:18.920,"After the land reform,"
00:15:18.640,00:15:20.680,我们农民有地有房子,00:15:18.920,00:15:20.380,farmers own land and houses.
00:15:20.880,00:15:22.120,这些东西你都没有算进去,00:15:20.680,00:15:22.240,But none of these are counted.
00:15:22.120,00:15:24.240,你算进去恐怕就不完全一样了,00:15:22.240,00:15:24.380,"Otherwise, I’m afraid it won't be the same."
00:15:24.680,00:15:27.680,另外就是中国是超大型的国家,00:15:24.380,00:15:27.460,"Moreover, China is a very large country."
00:15:27.960,00:15:30.280,你你把上海最富裕的和西藏最,,,
00:15:30.280,00:15:31.160,贫困的,00:15:27.720,00:15:32.900,"When comparing the richest places in Shanghai
with the poorest ones in Tibet,"
00:15:31.360,00:15:32.520,你这样来比较的话,,,
00:15:32.560,00:15:34.840,那基尼系数肯定是世界最大的了,00:15:32.900,00:15:35.060,the Gini coefficient must be the highest in the world.
00:15:35.600,00:15:38.120,实际上他精神能不能适应这种超,00:15:35.060,00:15:41.120,"Can the Gini coefficient actually adjust to
the measurement of such a large country?"
00:15:38.120,00:15:40.720,大规模的这个国家的衡量,,,
00:15:42.400,00:15:45.080,而且我们即使用基尼系数本身的,00:15:41.860,00:15:47.620,"Meanwhile, even if we look at a smaller region,"
00:15:45.080,00:15:45.920,定义,,,
00:15:46.520,00:15:47.880,把这范围缩小,,,
00:15:47.880,00:15:50.520,一般呢就是研究上海这个城市的,00:15:47.840,00:15:51.600,"for example, researching the Gini coefficient in Shanghai City,"
00:15:50.520,00:15:51.480,经济系数,,,
00:15:51.640,00:15:53.440,或者江苏省的经济学说,00:15:51.600,00:15:53.540,"or Jiangsu Province,"
00:15:53.440,00:15:54.280,你可以发觉,,,
00:15:54.280,00:15:56.200,就是它总体上还是在,00:15:53.600,00:15:55.600,"you can find that overall,"
00:15:56.480,00:15:58.240,相对合理的范围之内的,00:15:55.600,00:15:58.600,it is still within a relatively reasonable range.
00:15:58.760,00:16:00.280,那么这就是说是,,,
00:16:00.280,00:16:02.080,究竟对超大型的规模,00:15:58.740,00:16:03.040,"It reveals a problem: how should a
large-scaled countries be measured?"
00:16:02.080,00:16:03.000,怎么衡量,,,
00:16:03.040,00:16:04.160,基尼系数,00:16:03.200,00:16:04.740,Is the Gini coefficient [in this case] suitable?
00:16:04.200,00:16:05.440,适用不适用,,,
00:16:05.480,00:16:07.880,我觉得这是可以提出质疑的啊,00:16:04.740,00:16:07.240,I think this should be questioned.
00:16:08.240,00:16:09.520,那地方还有一个指标,00:16:08.220,00:16:09.940,There is also another indicator:
00:16:09.520,00:16:11.200,呃西方国家经常用的,,,
00:16:11.200,00:16:11.920,呃,,,
00:16:12.120,00:16:14.080,就是出国的人数,00:16:09.940,00:16:14.500,"the number of outbound travelers,
which Western countries often use."
00:16:14.120,00:16:15.040,出境的人数,,,
00:16:15.080,00:16:17.160,我们现在正式统计是,00:16:15.000,00:16:17.180,"According to official statistics,"
00:16:17.200,00:16:18.560,我看17年的,,,
00:16:18.680,00:16:21.400,中国出境人次是1.3亿,00:16:17.340,00:16:21.400,"the number of China’s outbound
travelers in 2017 was 130 million,"
00:16:21.400,00:16:23.360,乃至于世界最大的,00:16:21.400,00:16:25.300,already ranking highest in the world.
00:16:23.360,00:16:25.400,这个出境人数了啊,,,
00:16:25.440,00:16:25.880,但实际上,,,
00:16:25.920,00:16:27.920,我觉得这个还是有点保守了,00:16:25.400,00:16:27.740,"But in fact, I think this figure is still a bit conservative."
00:16:28.000,00:16:29.880,因为我在欧洲长期生活过,00:16:27.880,00:16:29.940,"Because I lived in Europe for a long time,"
00:16:29.880,00:16:30.960,欧洲都是小国家,00:16:29.940,00:16:31.180,European countries are quite small.
00:16:31.000,00:16:33.440,你看我现在从北京到上海,,,
00:16:33.480,00:16:34.640,上海到北京,00:16:31.180,00:16:37.860,"Traveling from Beijing to Shanghai will take
one hour and forty to fifty minutes by plane."
00:16:34.840,00:16:37.840,飞机是一个小时四五十分钟啊,,,
00:16:38.040,00:16:38.960,这个距离呢,,,
00:16:38.960,00:16:40.640,在欧洲至少走10个国家,00:16:37.940,00:16:41.800,"The distance traveled can at least
cover ten European countries, right?"
00:16:40.680,00:16:41.880,对不对,,,
00:16:42.480,00:16:43.560,所以我就说,,,
00:16:43.600,00:16:45.960,呃在中国严格的讲,00:16:42.080,00:16:45.680,"Therefore, in China, strictly speaking,"
00:16:46.000,00:16:48.520,就是如果你真的从这个经济能力,00:16:45.900,00:16:48.840,"In terms of economic capacity,"
00:16:48.520,00:16:49.000,来说的,,,
00:16:49.000,00:16:50.880,凡是能够坐飞机的,00:16:48.840,00:16:52.160,"anyone who can afford taking a plane
 or a high-speed train"
00:16:50.960,00:16:52.160,能够坐高铁的,,,
00:16:52.200,00:16:53.640,都是有能力出境的,00:16:52.160,00:16:53.920,"all have the ability to go abroad,"
00:16:53.680,00:16:55.680,唉特别用欧洲标准的话,00:16:53.920,00:16:55.900,especially based on European standards.
00:16:55.680,00:16:56.520,唉另外一个,,,
00:16:56.520,00:16:57.240,我们经常听到,,,
00:16:57.240,00:16:58.880,叫中等收入陷阱,00:16:55.900,00:16:58.900,"Another concept we often hear is
 the “middle income trap”,"
00:16:59.160,00:17:00.360,那世界银行提出的概念,00:16:58.900,00:17:00.960,which was defined by the World Bank.
00:17:00.360,00:17:01.560,我自己从来不用,00:17:01.020,00:17:02.140,I never use it.
00:17:01.560,00:17:03.520,你看他那个报告,00:17:02.140,00:17:03.660,"The World Bank report released that,"
00:17:03.880,00:17:07.040,就是它里边把叫做13个,,,
00:17:07.480,00:17:09.320,呃国家或者是经济体,00:17:03.660,00:17:12.860,"13 countries or economies have successfully
crossed the “middle income trap”."
00:17:09.320,00:17:11.040,已经成功的越过了,,,
00:17:11.040,00:17:12.880,这个中等收入陷阱,,,
00:17:12.880,00:17:15.360,我就看这13个国家是哪些国家,00:17:12.860,00:17:15.240,"When I checked which countries are included,"
00:17:15.800,00:17:18.160,我发现居然有七到几内啊,00:17:15.240,00:17:20.920,"I found that even Equatorial Guinea,
and Mauritius were included."
00:17:18.200,00:17:18.840,呵呵,,,
00:17:18.880,00:17:21.080,还有这个毛里求斯啊,,,
00:17:21.080,00:17:22.440,我就想这个麻烦了,00:17:20.920,00:17:22.920,"I said to myself, this would cause trouble."
00:17:22.440,00:17:23.880,唉因为吃到几年药,,,
00:17:24.280,00:17:27.280,他那个人均GDP10来年前,00:17:22.920,00:17:28.900,"Ten years ago, per capita GDP of Equatorial Guinea
surpassed Beijing and Shanghai"
00:17:27.320,00:17:28.760,就超过北京上海了,,,
00:17:28.760,00:17:29.880,就2万美元,00:17:28.900,00:17:30.520,"reaching US$ 20,000."
00:17:29.920,00:17:33.600,唉但是因为非洲国家我走的多,00:17:30.520,00:17:33.420,"But, from my experience in Africa,"
00:17:33.840,00:17:34.600,这个吃到嘴里啊,,,
00:17:34.640,00:17:37.040,至少是15年前的时候,00:17:33.420,00:17:40.220,"at least 15 years ago, in Equatorial Guinea,
half of the residents did not even have running water."
00:17:37.240,00:17:38.760,它的城市居民一半,,,
00:17:38.800,00:17:40.080,连自来水都没有,,,
00:17:40.080,00:17:42.080,因为发现了石油,00:17:40.220,00:17:42.000,"Because of oil exploration,"
00:17:42.080,00:17:43.120,然后一些公司,,,
00:17:43.120,00:17:44.720,外国公司去投资了,00:17:42.000,00:17:44.520,some foreign companies came and invested.
00:17:44.720,00:17:46.480,一下子人均GDP就上来了,00:17:44.520,00:17:46.480,Then the GDP per capita soared at once.
00:17:46.720,00:17:48.800,我觉得这个跟超越中等收入陷阱,00:17:46.480,00:17:48.860,"It has nothing to do with surpassing
the middle income trap."
00:17:48.800,00:17:49.600,有什么关系,,,
00:17:49.600,00:17:50.640,我觉得非常奇怪,00:17:48.860,00:17:50.500,I find it very confusing.
00:17:50.640,00:17:51.920,毛里求斯也是一样的,00:17:50.500,00:17:51.920,Same with Mauritius.
00:17:51.920,00:17:53.240,那是很小很小的国家,,,
00:17:53.240,00:17:54.520,那相当于我们一个县,00:17:51.920,00:17:55.380,"It's quite a small country,
equivalent to just one county in China."
00:17:54.520,00:17:55.400,对不对,,,
00:17:55.600,00:17:57.040,那靠一个经济旅游,00:17:55.380,00:17:57.060,"Only relying on tourism,"
00:17:57.040,00:17:58.800,他就可以GDP就可以上来了,00:17:57.060,00:17:58.720,its GDP could rise up.
00:17:58.800,00:18:00.320,他说你碰到一场危机,00:17:58.720,00:18:01.720,"But once encountering a crisis,
it’s GDP will decline rapidly."
00:18:00.320,00:18:01.520,GDP就下去了,,,
00:18:01.800,00:18:02.520,对不对,,,
00:18:02.520,00:18:04.480,所以我觉得跨国比较,,,
00:18:04.480,00:18:07.360,恐怕是要有一个规模的概念,00:18:02.120,00:18:07.420,"So I think country-to-country comparisons
should be differentiated by scales."
00:18:07.440,00:18:09.960,否则恐怕这个读懂中国的门,00:18:07.420,00:18:10.860,"Otherwise, I'm afraid it’s going
away from understanding China."
00:18:09.960,00:18:10.840,都进不去,,,
00:18:10.840,00:18:13.240,唉你把这个这些小国家,00:18:10.860,00:18:14.700,Comparing these small countries to China
00:18:13.240,00:18:14.800,跟中国放在一起比,,,
00:18:14.800,00:18:16.520,有点像把这个大象和跳蚤,00:18:14.700,00:18:17.400,"is kind of like putting elephants and fleas together,"
00:18:16.520,00:18:17.480,放在一起,,,
00:18:17.480,00:18:18.800,然后得出一些结论,,,
00:18:18.800,00:18:20.560,很难令人信服,00:18:17.400,00:18:20.520,then ending up at an unconvincing conclusion.
00:18:20.960,00:18:23.240,那么小国家有小国家的长处,00:18:20.820,00:18:25.000,"Small countries have their strengths
and limitations as well."
00:18:23.280,00:18:25.240,也有小国家的脆弱,,,
00:18:25.400,00:18:25.560,对,,,
00:18:25.560,00:18:26.760,我有很好的一个朋友,00:18:25.000,00:18:27.700,"I have a good friend from Singapore,"
00:18:26.760,00:18:27.760,新加坡人,,,
00:18:27.800,00:18:28.640,他就说他们,,,
00:18:28.680,00:18:30.760,我们现在人均GDP是挺高,00:18:27.700,00:18:30.500,"and he said that their current
GDP per capita is quite high,"
00:18:31.280,00:18:33.280,但他我们是如履薄冰,00:18:30.500,00:18:33.060,but they feel like walking on thin ice.
00:18:33.480,00:18:35.440,他有一个911这样的事情他,00:18:33.060,00:18:36.500,"If an event like ""9/11"" happened,
Singapore would be broken."
00:18:35.480,00:18:36.480,新加坡就完了,,,
00:18:36.760,00:18:38.040,啊真是这样的,00:18:36.620,00:18:38.380,This is really the case.
00:18:38.440,00:18:39.280,你比方中国,,,
00:18:39.280,00:18:41.760,它这个承受各种各样的灾难的,00:18:38.380,00:18:42.040,"This is unlike China. We have the ability to
withstand all kinds of disasters."
00:18:41.760,00:18:42.320,影响,,,
00:18:42.320,00:18:43.960,汶川地震这么大的事情,00:18:42.040,00:18:44.020,"Even undergoing a catastrophe
like the Wenchuan earthquake,"
00:18:44.280,00:18:46.520,国家经济纹丝不动唉,00:18:44.020,00:18:46.460,the national economy still remained the same.
00:18:46.760,00:18:49.040,所以这个是大小规模不一样,,,
00:18:49.160,00:18:51.680,这个产生的是不一样的这个特点,00:18:46.560,00:18:51.660,That's due to their different scales.
00:18:52.040,00:18:53.000,呃中国的特点,,,
00:18:53.000,00:18:55.280,我觉得大国有自己的大国优势啊,00:18:51.660,00:18:57.180,"China’s advantage, as a large country,
lies in having enough room for maneuver."
00:18:55.280,00:18:57.120,这个它回旋余地特别大,,,
00:18:57.800,00:18:59.560,所以我们不能够把这个大象和,,,
00:18:59.560,00:18:59.960,跳蚤,,,
00:18:59.960,00:19:01.360,放在一起进行比较,00:18:57.180,00:19:03.420,"Comparing elephants with fleas
will lead to incorrect conclusions."
00:19:01.360,00:19:03.480,这样比较是得不出正确的结论,,,
00:19:03.480,00:19:05.600,我觉得我们还是要用实事求是的,00:19:03.420,00:19:06.420,"I think we have to ""seek truth from facts""."
00:19:05.600,00:19:06.240,方法,,,
00:19:06.720,00:19:08.400,我自己做政治学,00:19:06.720,00:19:08.180,I study politics.
00:19:08.400,00:19:11.240,实际上在政治学等社会科学里边,00:19:08.180,00:19:11.080,"Actually, in politics and other social sciences,"
00:19:11.680,00:19:13.760,这个西方主流学者,,,
00:19:14.360,00:19:17.760,这个做了很多的这个努力,00:19:11.080,00:19:17.440,Western mainstream scholars have made many efforts.
00:19:17.760,00:19:19.200,但是由于种种原因,00:19:17.440,00:19:20.680,"But for various reasons,
they still cannot fully understand China."
00:19:19.200,00:19:20.600,还是读不懂中国,,,
00:19:20.840,00:19:22.200,一般以政治学为例,00:19:20.720,00:19:22.220,"Take politics as an example,"
00:19:22.520,00:19:24.480,这个政治学者对中国的预测,00:19:22.220,00:19:24.920,"political scholars' predictions
about China are almost always wrong."
00:19:24.480,00:19:25.600,几乎都是错的,,,
00:19:25.600,00:19:26.440,西方主流学者,,,
00:19:26.440,00:19:28.120,不仅没有准准确的预测,00:19:24.920,00:19:29.440,"Western mainstream scholars not only
failed to predict China’s development,"
00:19:28.120,00:19:28.400,中国,,,
00:19:28.400,00:19:30.600,甚至没有预测到苏联的解体,00:19:29.460,00:19:30.760,but even the collapse of the Soviet Union.
00:19:31.000,00:19:32.520,没有预测到中国的崛起,,,
00:19:32.520,00:19:34.520,也没有预测到特朗普的上台,00:19:30.760,00:19:34.540,"Neither the rise of China nor
Trump's presidency were predicated."
00:19:35.120,00:19:36.960,地方主流的经济学者,,,
00:19:37.320,00:19:38.480,几乎都没有预测到,00:19:34.540,00:19:40.080,"Western mainstream economists almost all
failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis."
00:19:38.520,00:19:40.280,08年的金融危机,,,
00:19:40.800,00:19:43.800,西方这个各种所谓社会科学,00:19:40.200,00:19:43.940,Western so-called social sciences are all trying to
00:19:44.480,00:19:46.680,想套用自然科学的方法,00:19:43.940,00:19:49.380,"apply natural science methods
and various mathematical models."
00:19:47.040,00:19:49.400,啊套用各种各样的数学模式,,,
00:19:49.400,00:19:51.400,但现在看来无法解决,00:19:49.380,00:19:51.240,"But now [western societies] seem
unable to cope with the challenges"
00:19:51.600,00:19:53.880,人类社会这种丰富性,00:19:51.240,00:19:55.420,"brought by the diversity and complexity
in human society."
00:19:53.920,00:19:54.600,复杂性,,,
00:19:54.600,00:19:55.320,带来的挑战,,,
00:19:55.360,00:19:56.520,他没法应对,00:19:55.420,00:19:56.860,Can't deal with it.
00:19:57.080,00:19:59.760,所以我老觉得这个中国学者啊,00:19:56.860,00:20:02.020,"So I always say that Chinese scholars,
and even our entire academy,"
00:19:59.760,00:20:01.320,或者我们整个学界,,,
00:20:01.320,00:20:04.960,应该这个结束这个为西方话语,00:20:02.180,00:20:06.260,should end the era of “working” for Western discourse.
00:20:04.960,00:20:06.040,打工啊,,,
00:20:06.320,00:20:07.200,这个这个时代,,,
00:20:07.240,00:20:08.720,应该是走向终结了,00:20:06.260,00:20:08.760,This era should be ended.
00:20:08.960,00:20:10.480,我叫做破字当头,00:20:08.760,00:20:11.640,"The so-called ""breaking"" comes first,
then the ""making"" follows."
00:20:10.480,00:20:11.560,立在其中,,,
00:20:11.600,00:20:13.400,唉解构西方话语,00:20:12.000,00:20:15.080,"Deconstruct Western discourse
and construct Chinese discourse."
00:20:13.760,00:20:15.080,间隔中国话语,,,
00:20:15.840,00:20:17.600,那么怎么读懂中国,00:20:15.560,00:20:18.060,So should we comprehend China?
00:20:17.640,00:20:19.400,我谈谈我的一些经验啊,00:20:18.120,00:20:19.900,I want to share some of my experiences.
00:20:19.440,00:20:21.240,我主要采用三个方法,00:20:19.940,00:20:21.100,I mainly use three methods.
00:20:21.320,00:20:24.520,一个呢我是比较注重大数据,00:20:21.100,00:20:25.520,"Firstly, I pay more attention to big data and big polls,"
00:20:25.000,00:20:25.680,大民调,,,
00:20:25.720,00:20:27.400,特别是比较权威的机构,00:20:25.540,00:20:27.940,especially released by authoritative organizations.
00:20:27.920,00:20:28.520,做的,,,
00:20:28.520,00:20:30.440,而且呢几个参照着看,00:20:28.080,00:20:30.560,And you need to compare them against each other.
00:20:30.920,00:20:31.360,你比方说,,,
00:20:31.400,00:20:33.640,你看这个PO中心也好,00:20:30.720,00:20:33.420,"For example, if you review the data from Pew Center,"
00:20:33.640,00:20:34.680,一艘C也好,00:20:33.420,00:20:35.920,"Ipsos and Asian Barometer,"
00:20:34.680,00:20:36.080,Acer博拉米特也好,,,
00:20:36.360,00:20:38.520,他们对中国的整体的这个预测,00:20:35.920,00:20:38.560,their predictions about China as a whole:
00:20:38.520,00:20:40.400,你对国家发展满意不满意,00:20:38.560,00:20:41.100,Are you satisfied with the development situation
00:20:40.400,00:20:41.480,道路满意不满意,,,
00:20:41.480,00:20:43.240,这些问题他都问了,00:20:41.100,00:20:42.700,or the development path of your nation?
00:20:43.360,00:20:45.240,3年5年10年啊,00:20:42.720,00:20:45.260,"They have been asking these questions
for three years, five years and ten years."
00:20:45.720,00:20:46.760,你综合比较一下,,,
00:20:46.760,00:20:47.560,大概可以得出,00:20:45.260,00:20:48.920,"Probably you can draw a more cautious
conclusion by comparing comprehensively."
00:20:47.560,00:20:48.960,比较慎重的结论的,,,
00:20:49.680,00:20:50.040,第二呢,,,
00:20:50.080,00:20:51.560,我是主张就是,00:20:49.040,00:20:53.480,"Secondly, I advocate fieldwork and research."
00:20:51.800,00:20:53.400,要实地考察和调研,,,
00:20:53.400,00:20:55.560,一定要实地看一看,00:20:53.480,00:20:55.420,You should have a look there.
00:20:55.640,00:20:57.880,唉这个会比较找到感觉,00:20:55.420,00:20:57.600,And you will have a clearer mind.
00:20:58.520,00:21:01.000,光在象牙塔里做文章是不行的,00:20:58.020,00:21:00.740,You can't make publications in the ivory tower.
00:21:01.040,00:21:02.960,光在书斋里看数据,,,
00:21:02.960,00:21:05.160,也是会这个呃离谱,00:21:00.740,00:21:06.000,"Just reading data in your study
will end up with a strikingly wrong conclusion."
00:21:05.200,00:21:06.480,离得非常之厉害,,,
00:21:06.760,00:21:07.240,第三呢,,,
00:21:07.240,00:21:08.000,就是我觉得,00:21:06.560,00:21:08.640,"Thirdly, to comprehend China,"
00:21:08.000,00:21:09.720,读懂中国一个国家太大了,00:21:08.640,00:21:09.560,"because of its large scale,"
00:21:09.720,00:21:10.920,我觉得要分板块,00:21:09.560,00:21:11.080,I think we need to interpret by sectors.
00:21:10.920,00:21:13.600,唉我经常用的是一个叫做发达,00:21:11.080,00:21:14.080,"I often call one sector the ""developed sector"","
00:21:13.600,00:21:14.120,板块,,,
00:21:14.120,00:21:15.000,一个叫做,,,
00:21:15.200,00:21:16.520,新一经济板块,00:21:14.080,00:21:16.120,"and the other ""emerging economy sector""."
00:21:16.760,00:21:19.160,然后要看这两个板块之间的互动,00:21:16.400,00:21:19.620,"Then we look at the interaction
between these two sectors."
00:21:19.160,00:21:19.880,关系,,,
00:21:19.920,00:21:21.320,不要静态的看,00:21:19.620,00:21:22.620,"You have to observe dynamically
instead of statically."
00:21:21.440,00:21:22.560,以动态来看,,,
00:21:23.360,00:21:24.840,那么用这样一些方法,,,
00:21:24.840,00:21:25.840,综合起来呢,,,
00:21:25.880,00:21:27.400,就是我觉得,00:21:22.700,00:21:30.040,"I think it will be easier to understand China
by merging these methods."
00:21:28.280,00:21:30.080,比较容易读懂中国,,,
00:21:30.640,00:21:32.240,总之我觉得读懂中国,,,
00:21:32.280,00:21:32.960,需要有一种,00:21:30.540,00:21:34.860,"In short, understanding China requires
the spirits and methods of ""seeking truth from facts""."
00:21:32.960,00:21:35.080,实事求是的精神和方法,,,
00:21:35.440,00:21:38.640,呃需要超前的这个研究一些问题,00:21:34.860,00:21:38.040,Some issues need to be studied in advance.
00:21:38.760,00:21:41.360,究竟中国现在发展到什么阶段,00:21:38.120,00:21:40.800,What stage is China at now?
00:21:41.600,00:21:43.000,那么我们的指标体系,00:21:41.240,00:21:44.500,"What improvements should be made
to the indicator system?"
00:21:43.000,00:21:44.480,要做哪些改进,,,
00:21:44.760,00:21:47.000,特别是现在一带一路,00:21:44.500,00:21:47.080,"Especially now, under the Belt and Road Initiative,"
00:21:47.000,00:21:48.240,中国整个的规模,,,
00:21:48.280,00:21:49.120,这么大的规模,00:21:47.080,00:21:50.240,China opens to the world with such a large scale.
00:21:49.160,00:21:50.320,走向世界,,,
00:21:50.320,00:21:51.800,了解发展中国家,,,
00:21:51.840,00:21:52.720,了解非洲,00:21:50.240,00:21:53.940,"We learn more about developing countries,
such as Africa, Latin America,"
00:21:52.720,00:21:53.760,了解拉美,,,
00:21:53.920,00:21:55.640,了解西方准确的把握,00:21:53.940,00:21:55.980,"and also know more about the West, in order
to accurately comprehend the current situation."
00:21:55.680,00:21:58.000,这样我们就形成一种真正的定力,,,
00:21:58.280,00:22:00.840,这个定力我觉得是最重要的,00:21:56.040,00:22:00.740,"Then we can generate our strategic focus
which I deem the most important."
00:22:00.960,00:22:01.240,好吧,,,
00:22:01.240,00:22:02.080,我先就说这些,00:22:00.740,00:22:02.800,"All right, that’s all for today. Thank you all."

00:22:02.120,00:22:02.840,谢谢大家,,,
00:22:07.600,00:22:07.800,好,,,
00:22:07.840,00:22:09.280,掌声送给张教授,00:22:07.520,00:22:09.260,The applause was to Prof. Zhang.
00:22:09.280,00:22:09.800,您辛苦了,,,
00:22:09.840,00:22:10.560,请坐,00:22:09.260,00:22:10.820,Thank you. Please have a seat.
00:22:10.840,00:22:11.480,嗯,,,
00:22:11.920,00:22:13.920,刚才张教授通过一段演讲,00:22:11.580,00:22:15.780,"Through speech, Prof. Zhang told us
 how to observe China."
00:22:13.960,00:22:15.920,告诉大家观察中国的问题,,,
00:22:16.200,00:22:17.840,其实也想问一下张老师,00:22:16.120,00:22:17.620,"Actually, I have a question."
00:22:17.840,00:22:19.040,您现在特别强调,00:22:17.620,00:22:19.940,"Prof. Zhang, you particularly emphasize
observing China at current,"
00:22:19.080,00:22:20.240,在当下观察中国,,,
00:22:20.280,00:22:21.320,不要盲人摸象,00:22:20.080,00:22:21.340,and avoid taking a part for the whole.
00:22:21.320,00:22:22.840,这个当下这个时间点啊,,,
00:22:22.880,00:22:24.880,它透出了一种紧迫性,00:22:21.340,00:22:24.520,The adverbial “at current” reveals a sense of urgency.
00:22:24.880,00:22:26.280,那反过来说,00:22:24.520,00:22:26.180,"Then conversely,"
00:22:26.280,00:22:28.440,如果我们还在用遗忘的一些标准,00:22:26.280,00:22:29.640,what if we still use some of the previous standards
00:22:28.440,00:22:29.600,来观察中国问题,,,
00:22:29.640,00:22:31.200,用西方的一些体系,,,
00:22:31.200,00:22:32.880,来观察中国问题的话,00:22:29.640,00:22:33.820,or some Western systems to observe China?
00:22:32.880,00:22:34.040,会怎样呢,,,
00:22:34.640,00:22:37.800,呃这个对我们中国人来说的话呢,00:22:34.340,00:22:40.600,"For us Chinese, we must fully understand China first."
00:22:38.040,00:22:40.640,呃首先要准确的读懂自己,,,
00:22:40.640,00:22:41.960,这个很重要,00:22:40.600,00:22:41.780,This is very important.
00:22:42.120,00:22:44.800,呃我们现在这个中央的定位是准,00:22:41.780,00:22:44.760,"The positioning of our Central
Committee is accurate:"
00:22:44.800,00:22:44.960,的,,,
00:22:44.960,00:22:47.040,就是从这个站起来,00:22:44.760,00:22:48.360,"""from standing up, to getting rich, and to getting strong""."
00:22:47.040,00:22:47.560,富起来,,,
00:22:47.560,00:22:48.400,到强起来,,,
00:22:48.400,00:22:49.680,这个伟大的飞跃,00:22:48.360,00:22:49.680,This is a great leap.
00:22:49.760,00:22:52.080,我觉得这个是相当精准的,00:22:49.680,00:22:51.880,I think it’s quite accurate.
00:22:52.680,00:22:55.800,那么呃我觉得就是对国外也是,00:22:52.400,00:22:56.260,Then I think it's the same for foreign countries.
00:22:55.800,00:22:56.360,一样的,,,
00:22:56.400,00:22:58.560,就你怎么把一个真实的中国传达,,,
00:22:58.560,00:22:59.200,出去,00:22:56.260,00:23:02.500,"How should we present the real China? The answer
is through confident and equal communication."
00:22:59.720,00:23:00.680,就是更好的,,,
00:23:00.680,00:23:02.520,更自信的平等的交流,,,
00:23:02.720,00:23:03.920,呃现在蛮重要的,00:23:02.500,00:23:04.000,It’s very important right now.
00:23:03.920,00:23:05.600,因为确实在一个关口上,00:23:04.000,00:23:05.720,Because we are on the threshold.
00:23:05.600,00:23:06.360,嗯,,,
00:23:06.560,00:23:07.480,呃张老师也说,00:23:06.400,00:23:07.480,"Prof. Zhang also said,"
00:23:07.480,00:23:09.080,现在要做的事情是破,,,
00:23:09.080,00:23:11.000,而且我们马上要做的事情是立,00:23:07.480,00:23:11.020,"what we should do now is ""breaking"",
and then next is “making”."
00:23:11.040,00:23:12.240,所以我们可以讨论的,,,
00:23:12.240,00:23:14.000,交流的空间还非常的多,00:23:11.020,00:23:13.700,"So there is much room for us to
discuss and communicate."
00:23:14.040,00:23:16.120,啊边前辉小组已经抢过了话筒,00:23:13.700,00:23:17.420,"Our pre-production panel have already grabbed
the microphone and are ready to ask questions."
00:23:16.120,00:23:17.560,显然要发问啊,,,
00:23:17.600,00:23:19.720,呃我们这次在做这个编前会,00:23:17.420,00:23:20.660,"When doing pre-production editing,"
00:23:19.720,00:23:20.520,在做策划的时候,,,
00:23:20.520,00:23:21.680,我也搜集了一些资料,00:23:20.660,00:23:21.600,I collected some information
00:23:21.680,00:23:22.880,我特意去搜集了一些,,,
00:23:22.880,00:23:24.280,还比较尖锐的问题,00:23:21.600,00:23:24.280,and also some sharp questions.
00:23:24.280,00:23:25.400,比如说也有,,,
00:23:25.480,00:23:26.880,中国人认为说,,,
00:23:27.080,00:23:28.800,中国的网购快递,00:23:24.280,00:23:30.120,"For example, some Chinese think that China’s
online shopping express delivery is very wasteful"
00:23:28.800,00:23:30.440,是很奢侈的事情,,,
00:23:30.440,00:23:34.360,是建立在资本家剥削快递小哥的,00:23:30.120,00:23:35.260,"and is based on capitalists exploiting
the delivery man."
00:23:34.360,00:23:35.200,基础之上,,,
00:23:35.200,00:23:35.920,你怎么看,00:23:35.260,00:23:36.360,"What’s your opinion, Prof. Zhang?"
00:23:36.640,00:23:38.440,不这个人要与时俱进,00:23:36.500,00:23:38.380,"This person must ""keep up with the times""."
00:23:38.440,00:23:39.960,实际上,,,
00:23:40.200,00:23:41.640,呃快递小哥,00:23:38.380,00:23:44.200,"In fact, the appearance of the delivery man is
an interesting phenomenon in China now."
00:23:41.640,00:23:44.160,现在中国一个很有意思的现象,,,
00:23:44.280,00:23:46.320,我看到是就是,,,
00:23:46.480,00:23:46.920,第一,,,
00:23:46.920,00:23:48.640,他通过自己的勤劳,00:23:44.200,00:23:50.460,"What I can see is that through their own hard work,"
00:23:49.040,00:23:50.480,通过自己的工作,,,
00:23:51.040,00:23:53.360,这个提供了非常好的服务,00:23:50.860,00:23:53.800,they provide a very good service.
00:23:53.920,00:23:54.520,嗯,,,
00:23:54.640,00:23:55.920,另外呢就是,,,
00:23:56.240,00:23:58.680,他也得到一种尊重,00:23:54.220,00:23:58.520,"In addition, they also earn respect."
00:23:58.760,00:23:59.840,你看这次习主席,,,
00:23:59.840,00:24:01.360,在元旦这个县词里边,00:23:58.520,00:24:02.900,"President Xi specially praised the couriers
in his speech on New Year’s Day."
00:24:01.400,00:24:02.920,都专门表扬了,,,
00:24:02.960,00:24:04.520,向他们表示问候,00:24:02.900,00:24:04.340,And also sent greetings to them.
00:24:04.720,00:24:04.960,真的,,,
00:24:05.000,00:24:07.480,这是中国一个非常新的现象,00:24:04.340,00:24:07.140,It's a new phenomenon in China.
00:24:07.800,00:24:10.520,而且据说总体工资还相当不错的,00:24:07.140,00:24:10.380,I also heard that the overall salary is quite good.
00:24:10.520,00:24:12.920,唉所以我觉得这个是符合,00:24:10.380,00:24:13.080,"So I think, this is in accordance with Marxism."
00:24:12.920,00:24:13.560,马克思主义的,,,
00:24:13.600,00:24:14.920,不是从国学角度来说,00:24:13.080,00:24:14.400,"It’s nothing to do with exploitation,"
00:24:14.960,00:24:16.720,而是说是他多劳多得,00:24:14.400,00:24:16.620,"but ""more pay for more work""."
00:24:17.160,00:24:19.480,唉我觉得这个是符合中国特色,00:24:16.620,00:24:20.160,"I think this is in line with Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics"
00:24:19.480,00:24:20.200,社会主义,,,
00:24:20.200,00:24:22.400,和社会主义初级阶段这个理论的,00:24:20.160,00:24:22.400,and the theory of the primary stage of socialism.
00:24:22.760,00:24:24.880,所以这个提问的人,00:24:22.400,00:24:26.120,"So the person who asks this question
must keep up with the times."
00:24:24.880,00:24:26.360,他要与时俱进,,,
00:24:26.400,00:24:28.520,五险一金的还是对,00:24:26.180,00:24:28.300,They also get Five Insurances and One Housing Fund.
00:24:28.520,00:24:29.480,还有五险一金,00:24:28.300,00:24:29.380,Right.
00:24:29.520,00:24:30.720,我有一个感触就是,,,
00:24:30.720,00:24:32.320,呃现在西方的很多的,00:24:29.380,00:24:34.220,"I feel that many statistical methods
and concepts in the West"
00:24:32.320,00:24:34.080,这些统计方法的设立,,,
00:24:34.120,00:24:37.320,呃都是一些百万到千万级人口的,00:24:34.220,00:24:38.040,"are put forward for countries with a
population of one million to ten million."
00:24:37.320,00:24:37.640,国家,,,
00:24:37.680,00:24:38.480,提出的概念,,,
00:24:38.520,00:24:39.960,那么在数学里头,00:24:38.080,00:24:39.800,"In mathematics,"
00:24:39.960,00:24:41.880,可能有人会想当然的认为说,,,
00:24:41.920,00:24:44.840,当人口成一个线性的生长的时候,00:24:39.800,00:24:44.520,"some people may take it for granted that
the population increases linearly,"
00:24:44.840,00:24:46.760,那你的处理问题的方式,,,
00:24:46.800,00:24:48.520,可能没有太大的变化,00:24:44.520,00:24:50.480,"so you can deal with other situations
by just adding the multiples."
00:24:48.560,00:24:50.640,需要把这个倍数增加上去就可以,,,
00:24:50.640,00:24:50.880,了,,,
00:24:50.880,00:24:52.120,但我一直有一种疑问,00:24:50.540,00:24:51.780,But I always have a doubt that
00:24:52.160,00:24:54.000,就是说像到了一级,00:24:51.780,00:24:54.520,"when it comes to countries
with populations of hundreds of millions"
00:24:54.000,00:24:54.800,像美国这样,,,
00:24:54.800,00:24:56.240,或者是像中国或者印度,,,
00:24:56.240,00:24:57.960,这种I10亿级的人口的,00:24:54.520,00:24:58.840,"like America or countries with
billion populations like China and India,"
00:24:57.960,00:24:59.240,这种国家的时候,,,
00:24:59.280,00:25:01.120,是不是我们要抛弃这种概念,00:24:58.840,00:25:01.580,should we abandon this method?
00:25:01.120,00:25:01.560,也就是说,,,
00:25:01.600,00:25:02.880,我不能把原有的方法,,,
00:25:02.880,00:25:04.520,根据人口的增长倍数,,,
00:25:04.520,00:25:06.520,简单加权就能得到一个,00:25:01.740,00:25:07.760,"We can't add a simple weight
according to the population growth multiple."
00:25:06.520,00:25:07.560,我想当然的结果,,,
00:25:07.600,00:25:08.280,而是说,,,
00:25:08.320,00:25:11.040,它可能在就像超过了这个光速的,00:25:07.860,00:25:12.180,"Instead, it may be like a moving object
that exceeds the speed of light,"
00:25:11.040,00:25:11.840,运动物体一样,,,
00:25:11.840,00:25:12.720,它会超出了,,,
00:25:12.720,00:25:14.360,原有的这个体系的认知,00:25:12.180,00:25:14.460,"which will go beyond the knowledge of
the original system."
00:25:14.400,00:25:15.920,您觉得会不会有也有这样的,00:25:14.460,00:25:16.120,Do you think this will really happen?
00:25:15.960,00:25:17.800,它是一个质的变化,00:25:16.180,00:25:17.720,This is a qualitative change.
00:25:17.800,00:25:20.040,唉像中国这样的国家,00:25:17.720,00:25:21.140,"When a country like China reaches such a scale,"
00:25:20.040,00:25:21.360,到这样的规模之后,,,
00:25:21.360,00:25:23.840,你再进行这个大象跳蚤,00:25:21.140,00:25:24.920,"if you still do a comparison between
the ""elephant"" and the ""flea"","
00:25:23.840,00:25:25.560,这个比较就像拿这个,,,
00:25:25.840,00:25:28.240,啊一个一个玻璃杯,00:25:25.400,00:25:29.880,it will be like comparing a glass with an apple.
00:25:28.240,00:25:29.760,和一个苹果进行比较,,,
00:25:29.760,00:25:30.840,你当然可以画圆,,,
00:25:30.840,00:25:32.720,到时候都是分子原子啊,00:25:29.880,00:25:32.600,"Of course, you can say that they are
all comprised of molecules and atoms."
00:25:32.720,00:25:34.360,但这个比较意义非常小,00:25:32.600,00:25:34.480,But this kind of comparison is almost meaningless.
00:25:35.160,00:25:36.840,你要找类似的类型,00:25:34.620,00:25:37.020,You should compare their similar types.
00:25:36.880,00:25:38.120,像我前面提到,,,
00:25:38.120,00:25:40.000,我跟纽约时报记者的对话,00:25:37.020,00:25:40.080,"As I mentioned earlier, in a conversation with
a journalist from the New York Times,"
00:25:40.040,00:25:41.120,我就举这个例子,00:25:40.080,00:25:41.120,I used this example.
00:25:41.120,00:25:44.480,我说这个呃我自己如果开办一个,,,
00:25:44.480,00:25:46.000,民办的补习学校,00:25:41.260,00:25:48.760,"I said if I set up a cram school [test-prep school],
it will be a school of only fifty or sixty students."
00:25:46.000,00:25:47.080,也叫学校,,,
00:25:47.320,00:25:48.760,恐怕就50 60个学生,,,
00:25:48.760,00:25:49.440,对不对,,,
00:25:49.640,00:25:51.000,然后我办一个复旦大学,00:25:49.460,00:25:51.980,"But if I run a university like Fudan,"
00:25:51.000,00:25:51.880,这样的大学,,,
00:25:51.880,00:25:53.240,有3万学生,00:25:52.080,00:25:53.420,"which has 30,000 students."
00:25:53.520,00:25:56.160,这个管理方法是完全不一样的,00:25:53.420,00:25:56.520,"Then the management method
will be completely different, right?"
00:25:56.200,00:25:56.800,对不对,,,
00:25:57.040,00:25:58.400,国家治理也是一样的,00:25:56.900,00:25:58.440,The same can be applied to national governance.
00:25:58.400,00:25:59.720,这个差别打去了,00:25:58.440,00:26:00.020,There is a big difference.
00:25:59.720,00:26:00.680,嗯对,,,
00:26:00.960,00:26:01.960,呃这个问题啊,00:26:00.500,00:26:02.260,This question is really interesting.
00:26:02.000,00:26:02.760,确实很有意思,,,
00:26:02.760,00:26:04.040,有的时候看这些指标,,,
00:26:04.080,00:26:04.560,这些数字,,,
00:26:04.600,00:26:06.800,和我们平时真身边的那种感受,00:26:02.260,00:26:07.900,"Sometimes these indicators and data
are totally different from how we perceive in our life."
00:26:06.960,00:26:08.000,是完全不一样的,,,
00:26:08.000,00:26:09.760,这本身就说明一个问题是,00:26:07.900,00:26:11.420,"This means that whether
our own perception goes wrong,"
00:26:09.760,00:26:10.960,我们自己的感知能力,,,
00:26:10.960,00:26:11.800,出现了问题,,,
00:26:11.800,00:26:13.080,还是说这个指标体系,00:26:11.480,00:26:14.140,or there is a problem with the indicator system itself.
00:26:13.120,00:26:14.360,本身存在问题,,,
00:26:14.520,00:26:16.920,和平稳定安全这样的因素,00:26:14.140,00:26:17.780,"How to quantify such factors as peace,
stability and security?"
00:26:16.960,00:26:17.680,怎么去量化,,,
00:26:17.720,00:26:19.760,你比如说同样的一个东西,,,
00:26:19.840,00:26:20.840,在不同的环境里,00:26:17.780,00:26:23.720,"In different environments, such as
in peaceful or disorderly environments,"
00:26:20.840,00:26:22.080,和平安全的环境里,,,
00:26:22.080,00:26:24.360,和弱乱的环境里面,,,
00:26:24.360,00:26:26.560,它是不一样的估值就我们传统的,00:26:23.740,00:26:25.740,the same things may have different valuations.
00:26:26.560,00:26:26.960,话,00:26:25.740,00:26:27.040,The old saying that
00:26:27.240,00:26:29.280,盛世存古董,00:26:27.040,00:26:30.500,"""in the age of prosperity, antiques are preserved;
while in troubled times, gold is preferred."""
00:26:29.320,00:26:30.760,乱世存黄金,,,
00:26:30.760,00:26:31.960,黄金还是黄金,00:26:30.500,00:26:32.580,Antiques and gold are unchanged.
00:26:31.960,00:26:33.040,古董还是古董,,,
00:26:33.040,00:26:33.800,但是古董啊,,,
00:26:33.800,00:26:35.040,可能在那个战乱时代,00:26:32.580,00:26:36.000,"However, antiques cannot even
trade a steamed bread in warring times."
00:26:35.040,00:26:36.240,连一个馒头都换不来,,,
00:26:36.520,00:26:36.920,但是你看,,,
00:26:36.920,00:26:38.720,我们今天很多资产中的估值,00:26:36.000,00:26:38.400,But the valuation of many of our assets today
00:26:38.720,00:26:39.560,土地,,,
00:26:39.600,00:26:40.600,房屋,00:26:38.400,00:26:41.120,"such as land, houses and antiques,"
00:26:40.600,00:26:41.400,古董,,,
00:26:41.400,00:26:42.600,其实某种意义上来讲,00:26:41.120,00:26:42.460,"in a sense,"
00:26:42.600,00:26:45.920,这就是安全和平稳定的一家,00:26:42.460,00:26:45.500,"are the appreciation of security, peace and stability."
00:26:46.200,00:26:48.600,他这个西方采用这种,00:26:45.620,00:26:50.200,"Right. The so-called new
research methods of social science"
00:26:48.600,00:26:50.360,所谓新的社会科学的方法,,,
00:26:50.400,00:26:52.320,也是面临这样一个窘境,00:26:50.200,00:26:52.300,applied by the West also face such a dilemma.
00:26:52.360,00:26:54.160,就是他为了能够数学上,00:26:52.300,00:26:54.960,"Just for the sake of mathematical establishment,"
00:26:54.200,00:26:55.480,能够建立起来,,,
00:26:55.640,00:26:57.400,他必须限定一些,00:26:55.060,00:26:59.100,they have to define some variables and factors.
00:26:57.400,00:26:59.360,Rap一些要素,,,
00:26:59.360,00:27:01.160,唉这个变量东西,,,
00:27:01.160,00:27:02.560,你去掉一个加一个,00:26:59.500,00:27:03.860,"It will be completely different,
if you remove or add variables."
00:27:02.560,00:27:04.040,他就完全不一样了,,,
00:27:04.040,00:27:05.280,唉我特别同意,00:27:04.040,00:27:06.440,"I particularly agree with what
Mr. Hong Lin just said."
00:27:05.320,00:27:06.240,刚才洪琳老师讲,,,
00:27:06.240,00:27:06.640,这点,,,
00:27:06.680,00:27:08.760,我们中国一些套话,,,
00:27:08.800,00:27:10.120,一些我们都听得习以为常,00:27:06.440,00:27:12.540,"Some of our Chinese sayings are
taken for granted and regarded as cliché."
00:27:10.160,00:27:11.080,为常的东西,,,
00:27:11.080,00:27:12.800,都不愿意再说的东西,,,
00:27:13.520,00:27:15.320,你跟西方讲讲,00:27:13.180,00:27:14.780,You can tell them to the West:
00:27:15.520,00:27:16.920,这是我们的智慧,00:27:15.140,00:27:16.540,This is our wisdom.
00:27:16.920,00:27:18.640,那就和平与发展,00:27:16.540,00:27:20.960,We have been talking about peace and development for decades.
00:27:18.840,00:27:19.360,啊就这么概念,,,
00:27:19.360,00:27:21.040,我们都讲了几十年了,,,
00:27:21.240,00:27:22.160,确实是,,,
00:27:22.160,00:27:23.640,呃刚才我们已经说了,00:27:21.000,00:27:23.620,"Indeed, we have just said that"
00:27:23.640,00:27:26.160,我们通过一段的实践,00:27:23.620,00:27:25.920,"through a period of practice,"
00:27:26.160,00:27:28.240,就越来越觉得西方的一些标准,,,
00:27:28.280,00:27:29.600,西方的一些,00:27:25.920,00:27:33.280,"we gradually realize that some Western standards,
systems or some of their concepts"
00:27:29.640,00:27:31.640,呃这种体系,,,
00:27:31.640,00:27:33.040,或者他们的一些提法,,,
00:27:33.040,00:27:34.680,已经不太能够解决,,,
00:27:34.680,00:27:36.320,和解释中国的问题,00:27:33.300,00:27:36.180,are unable to solve and interpret China’s situation.
00:27:36.320,00:27:37.040,那问题是,,,
00:27:37.080,00:27:38.960,我们还可以从哪些侧面,00:27:36.180,00:27:40.640,"The problem is by which standards
can we observe China properly,"
00:27:39.000,00:27:40.440,再来观察中国的问题,,,
00:27:40.480,00:27:42.840,我们怎么来建立我们自己的体系,00:27:40.700,00:27:42.660,and how we can build our own systems.
00:27:42.840,00:27:45.280,我相信刚才张老师给了大家,00:27:42.660,00:27:45.960,I believe Prof. Zhang gave us a lot of inspiration.
00:27:45.320,00:27:46.200,很多的启发,,,
00:27:46.200,00:27:48.280,大家也可以开出自己的脑洞,00:27:45.960,00:27:47.820,We can all start thinking.
00:27:48.280,00:27:49.760,我们来做进一步的交流,00:27:47.820,00:27:51.200,Let's communicate further and inspire each other.
00:27:49.760,00:27:51.000,我们互相的来启发,,,
00:27:51.000,00:27:51.480,好不好,,,
00:27:51.480,00:27:52.280,所以接下来,,,
00:27:52.320,00:27:54.120,我会请现场的朋友来提问,00:27:51.200,00:27:54.140,"So next I will invite some in the audience
to ask questions."
00:27:54.160,00:27:56.400,呃有哪位有提问的可以举手,00:27:54.140,00:27:56.880,Please raise your hands.
00:27:56.440,00:27:57.120,给我,,,
00:27:58.080,00:27:58.720,好好,,,
00:27:58.720,00:28:00.160,这位姑娘穿白衣服的,00:27:57.880,00:28:00.940,"Yes, the girl in white, please."
00:28:00.400,00:28:00.840,请起,,,
00:28:01.680,00:28:04.200,之前有看过您和亨廷顿的学生,00:28:01.460,00:28:05.500,"Prof. Zhang, I have seen the debate between
you and Huntington’s student Fukuyama."
00:28:04.200,00:28:05.480,福山的论战,,,
00:28:05.480,00:28:07.520,然后呃我觉得,,,
00:28:07.560,00:28:09.320,就是呃亨廷顿肯定了,,,
00:28:09.320,00:28:10.240,中国共产党,00:28:05.500,00:28:13.160,"I think Huntington affirmed the Chinese Communist
Party’s ability to establish political order."
00:28:10.240,00:28:12.280,在这个建立政治秩序方面的,,,
00:28:12.280,00:28:13.120,这个能力,,,
00:28:13.120,00:28:15.560,然后这改革开放40周年来,00:28:13.160,00:28:15.400,"Since the reform and opening up,"
00:28:15.560,00:28:16.840,这个中国的发展,,,
00:28:16.880,00:28:18.480,肯定也是有很大部分,00:28:15.400,00:28:21.240,"China’s development was largely attributed to
our stable political order over the past four decades."
00:28:18.520,00:28:19.800,是因为这个我们政治秩序,,,
00:28:19.840,00:28:21.480,是稳定的这个原因,,,
00:28:21.480,00:28:24.040,但是在改革开放40周年以来,00:28:21.240,00:28:23.920,"But during the 40 years of reform and opening up,"
00:28:24.080,00:28:25.800,出现了很多的这样的,00:28:23.920,00:28:27.640,many emerging interest groups sprung up.
00:28:25.800,00:28:27.800,新兴利益的这样的集团,,,
00:28:27.800,00:28:28.320,他们可能,,,
00:28:28.360,00:28:29.960,可能有各种不同的利益诉求,00:28:27.640,00:28:29.940,"They may have different interest demands,"
00:28:29.960,00:28:31.760,我觉得是需要把他们,,,
00:28:31.840,00:28:32.680,呃扩大政治,00:28:29.940,00:28:34.240,and they should be more involved in the  political system.
00:28:32.720,00:28:34.440,参与到这个制度的过程中,,,
00:28:34.480,00:28:35.320,想问您一下,,,
00:28:35.320,00:28:37.720,就是中国模式是怎么把这些,00:28:34.240,00:28:39.180,"How does the China Model blend
various emerging interest groups"
00:28:37.760,00:28:39.360,不同的这些新兴利益集团,,,
00:28:39.360,00:28:42.080,吸纳到现有的这个政治制度当中,00:28:39.180,00:28:41.980,"into the existing political system,"
00:28:42.080,00:28:42.600,去,,,
00:28:42.600,00:28:44.200,然后让他们的利益诉求,00:28:41.980,00:28:45.580,and make their voices heard?
00:28:44.240,00:28:45.880,得到合理的表达呢,,,
00:28:45.920,00:28:47.600,这就是中国,00:28:45.840,00:28:49.180,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:28:47.880,00:28:49.440,听张维维说,00:28:49.180,00:28:53.100,"Translators: The Magpie Bridge Brigade 鹊桥小队翻译组
Twitter/FB/IG @BrigadeMagpie 公众号/微博: 鹊桥小队翻译组"
00:28:52.720,00:28:53.400,嗯,,,
00:28:53.520,00:28:54.880,中国现在的制度,,,
00:28:54.880,00:28:55.800,能不能避免,00:28:53.200,00:28:58.323,"Can China's current system avoid social unrest caused
by the polarization between the rich and the poor?"
00:28:55.800,00:28:56.920,因贫风化,,,
00:28:56.920,00:28:58.280,引起的社会动荡,,,
00:28:58.280,00:29:00.880,导致的大国兴衰的那种历史规律,00:28:58.323,00:29:00.900,"Can we avoid following the rule of history
that great powers rise and decline?"
00:29:00.960,00:29:02.080,所有的经济体,,,
00:29:02.120,00:29:03.960,当它发展到一定程度之后,00:29:00.900,00:29:04.040,"All economies, when reaching a certain level,"
00:29:03.960,00:29:06.080,使得最上头顶尖的人,,,
00:29:06.080,00:29:08.320,会快速的攫取财富,00:29:04.040,00:29:08.140,"will have a few people at the top seizing wealth quickly,"
00:29:08.320,00:29:09.720,而忽略了后面人的这个,00:29:08.220,00:29:11.200,but the rest of the people will be lagging behind.
00:29:09.760,00:29:11.320,所有的这个收入的速度,,,
00:29:11.800,00:29:13.600,你讲到这个贫富差距加什么,00:29:11.540,00:29:15.500,"When talking about the gap between rich and poor,
many people get excited immediately."
00:29:13.640,00:29:15.800,很多人马上就会激动起来,,,
00:29:15.840,00:29:17.680,中国怎么在面临这么多问题的,,,
00:29:17.680,00:29:18.160,情况下,00:29:15.520,00:29:20.600,"How could China make such great progress
when facing so many problems?"
00:29:18.160,00:29:19.880,仍然取得这么大的进步,,,
00:29:22.000,00:29:25.920,这就是中国听张维维说,00:29:21.600,00:29:24.940,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:29:27.760,00:29:28.720,想问您一下,00:29:24.940,00:29:27.340,"Translators: The Magpie Bridge Brigade 鹊桥小队翻译组
Twitter/FB/IG @BrigadeMagpie 公众号/微博: 鹊桥小队翻译组"
00:29:28.720,00:29:29.720,就是中国模式,,,
00:29:29.760,00:29:32.160,是怎么把这些不同的这些新兴,00:29:27.540,00:29:32.560,"How does the China Model blend
various emerging interest groups"
00:29:32.160,00:29:32.720,利益集团,,,
00:29:32.720,00:29:35.560,吸纳到现有的这个政治制度当中,00:29:32.560,00:29:35.560,into the existing political system?
00:29:35.560,00:29:36.080,去,,,
00:29:36.120,00:29:37.640,然后让他们的利益诉求,00:29:35.560,00:29:39.180,and make their voices heard?
00:29:37.640,00:29:39.200,得到合理的表达呢,,,
00:29:39.200,00:29:39.880,谢谢,00:29:39.180,00:29:40.200,Thank you.
00:29:39.920,00:29:41.320,嗯观察得很深,00:29:40.220,00:29:41.320,A very profound observation!
00:29:41.320,00:29:43.880,特别想问一下这位您是学生吗,00:29:41.320,00:29:43.820,Can I ask if you are a student?
,,,00:29:43.820,00:29:44.560,"Yes, I am."
00:29:43.920,00:29:45.560,噢我是学什么专业噢,00:29:44.560,00:29:45.340,What do you study?
00:29:45.560,00:29:47.160,我是学社会工作的,00:29:45.340,00:29:46.620,I study social work.
00:29:47.200,00:29:47.960,噢社会工作,00:29:47.040,00:29:48.220,"Ah, social work."
00:29:48.000,00:29:49.360,你看他又研究和停顿,,,
00:29:49.360,00:29:51.000,然后又关注浮山的观点,00:29:48.220,00:29:51.160,"She studies Huntington and also pays attention
to Fukuyama's point of view."
00:29:51.000,00:29:51.760,非常棒,,,
00:29:51.800,00:29:52.000,好,00:29:51.160,00:29:52.760,Awesome. Please have a seat.
00:29:52.040,00:29:52.440,请坐,,,
00:29:52.480,00:29:53.400,很棒,,,
00:29:53.400,00:29:55.480,呃问题很有水平啊,00:29:52.880,00:29:55.380,Great question.
00:29:55.800,00:29:56.920,呃我想是这样的,00:29:55.380,00:29:57.500,"In my opinion,"
00:29:56.920,00:29:59.200,就是呃你仔细看,00:29:57.500,00:30:00.320,"if you observe closely,"
00:29:59.200,00:30:00.920,就是实际上,,,
00:30:00.960,00:30:02.520,在江泽民时期,00:30:00.320,00:30:04.620,"you will find the theory of ""Three Represents""
proposed by Jiang Zemin"
00:30:02.520,00:30:04.320,提这个三个代表,,,
00:30:04.640,00:30:07.360,很大程度上就是为了解决这个,00:30:04.620,00:30:08.020,is largely in order to solve this problem.
00:30:07.360,00:30:08.040,问题,,,
00:30:08.440,00:30:10.320,因为其中一个代表代表,,,
00:30:10.320,00:30:13.080,最广大人民的根本利益唉,00:30:08.020,00:30:13.480,"""Representing the fundamental interests of the
masses"" is one of the ""Three Represents""."
00:30:13.840,00:30:16.440,那么而且是中国共产党,,,
00:30:16.440,00:30:19.680,向呃新社会阶层开放,00:30:13.480,00:30:19.400,"Meanwhile, China’s Communist Party
is open to emerging social classes,"
00:30:19.960,00:30:22.480,唉我不知道马云是什么时候入党,00:30:19.400,00:30:23.140,I don’t know when Jack Ma joined the Party.
00:30:22.480,00:30:22.720,的,,,
00:30:22.760,00:30:23.560,哈哈哈哈哈哈他不管人家,,,
00:30:23.600,00:30:23.840,马云,,,
00:30:23.880,00:30:25.880,也是共产党员的一部分,00:30:23.140,00:30:25.520,"But anyway, Jack Ma is also a Party member."
00:30:26.160,00:30:27.640,政协里面有个界别,00:30:25.520,00:30:28.820,"There is a sector called ""new social class"" in the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]."
00:30:27.680,00:30:29.200,就是新社会阶层对,,,
00:30:29.360,00:30:32.360,这个实际上就是新社会阶层,00:30:28.820,00:30:32.380,"Right, Jack Ma actually represents a new social class."
00:30:32.360,00:30:33.840,呃中国是用什么方法,,,
00:30:33.840,00:30:36.560,来把他们纳入这个政治,00:30:32.380,00:30:36.540,"How does China integrate them
into the current political system,"
00:30:36.760,00:30:38.920,或者我们叫协商民主的这个系统,00:30:36.540,00:30:39.060,"or what we call the ""socialist consultative democracy""?"
00:30:38.920,00:30:41.080,一个就是我们的协商民主的一,00:30:39.240,00:30:42.240,"The first step is to make them
a part of the consultative democracy,"
00:30:41.080,00:30:41.800,部分,,,
00:30:41.800,00:30:43.320,呃最典型的标志,,,
00:30:43.360,00:30:45.200,当然就是政协本身,00:30:42.260,00:30:47.300,"typically the CPPCC itself,
and the People's Congress."
00:30:45.240,00:30:46.680,包括人民代表大会,,,
00:30:46.720,00:30:47.280,唉,,,
00:30:47.560,00:30:48.840,另外呢就是,,,
00:30:49.160,00:30:50.080,呃整个中国共产党,00:30:47.300,00:30:52.300,"Besides, one good tradition in our Party is"
00:30:50.120,00:30:50.400,一个,,,
00:30:50.440,00:30:52.320,我觉得很好的一个传统,,,
00:30:52.360,00:30:53.280,我们叫做是,,,
00:30:53.320,00:30:55.840,呃从群众中来到群众中去那,00:30:52.300,00:30:56.300,"“of the people, for the people”."
00:30:55.880,00:30:58.880,我举一个例子来说明这个问题,00:30:56.300,00:30:58.540,There is an example.
00:30:59.120,00:30:59.560,你比方说,,,
00:30:59.600,00:31:01.920,现在滴滴打车,00:30:58.900,00:31:04.740,"Didi [ride-hailing] is now legal in China,
but illegal in Germany."
00:31:01.920,00:31:03.560,在中国是合法的,,,
00:31:03.560,00:31:05.080,唉你到德国就不合法,,,
00:31:05.120,00:31:07.800,唉因为德国它尤波来了之后,,,
00:31:08.120,00:31:10.560,呃跟这个现有的呃出租车行业,00:31:04.980,00:31:11.820,"Because Uber impacted the existing taxi industry
 after coming to Germany."
00:31:10.600,00:31:12.000,形成了冲突,,,
00:31:12.400,00:31:13.600,那么西方的做法,,,
00:31:13.600,00:31:15.360,典型的做法就是打官司,00:31:12.140,00:31:15.260,Then the typical approach in the West is to litigate.
00:31:15.760,00:31:16.400,打官司,,,
00:31:16.400,00:31:18.120,西方这个法制社会,00:31:15.260,00:31:19.320,"As a legal society, if you have lived in the West,"
00:31:18.120,00:31:19.200,你只要在那生活过,,,
00:31:19.200,00:31:21.800,你知道它是有利于既得利益者的,00:31:19.320,00:31:21.900,you will know that it benefits those with vested interests.
00:31:22.000,00:31:22.720,那么一般说,,,
00:31:22.760,00:31:23.320,这个官司,,,
00:31:23.360,00:31:25.600,大概率是出租车司机,00:31:21.900,00:31:27.480,"So generally speaking, the taxi driver
is much more likely to win."
00:31:25.880,00:31:26.440,唉,,,
00:31:26.560,00:31:27.760,又不会输唉,,,
00:31:27.880,00:31:29.600,结果呢他就被禁止了,00:31:27.860,00:31:29.520,Thus Uber was banned.
00:31:29.680,00:31:32.000,呃德国法国就到现在都是这样的,00:31:29.520,00:31:32.180,France is a similar case.
00:31:32.000,00:31:32.400,没有意义,,,
00:31:32.400,00:31:34.560,那么中国是把它合法化了,00:31:32.180,00:31:34.180,But Uber is legalized in China.
00:31:34.680,00:31:36.080,呃虽然有很多问题,00:31:34.360,00:31:36.220,"You see, although there are many questions,"
00:31:36.080,00:31:37.200,我们在发展中,,,
00:31:37.200,00:31:39.280,来解决新出现的问题,00:31:36.220,00:31:39.340,"we can solve the emerging ones
in the developing process."
00:31:39.680,00:31:43.000,那么一个重要的这个呃条件,00:31:39.340,00:31:43.340,An important condition is that
00:31:43.000,00:31:43.720,就是怎么说呢,,,
00:31:43.760,00:31:44.760,就我们有这么一个,,,
00:31:44.760,00:31:46.240,协商民主的机制,00:31:43.340,00:31:46.240,we have such a mechanism for consultative democracy.
00:31:46.600,00:31:48.960,你滴滴可能在政协的人大,00:31:46.360,00:31:48.740,"Didi may have no representatives in the CPPCC,"
00:31:48.960,00:31:50.320,在中国共产党中央委员会,00:31:48.740,00:31:51.720,"the National People ’s Congress or
the Central Committee of the CCP."
00:31:50.320,00:31:51.800,都没有代表,,,
00:31:51.800,00:31:52.800,没有关系,00:31:51.720,00:31:52.760,But it doesn't matter.
00:31:53.080,00:31:55.720,但你反映了一种新的社会需求,00:31:52.760,00:31:55.760,"Once it reflects new social needs or interests,"
00:31:55.720,00:31:57.200,那么这个时候呢,,,
00:31:57.520,00:31:59.480,共产党要考虑这个问题啊,00:31:55.760,00:31:59.460,the Communist Party will take it into consideration.
00:31:59.760,00:32:01.360,唉这个名医来了之后,00:31:59.460,00:32:02.920,"The public opinion can be heard
through some special ways,"
00:32:01.360,00:32:02.800,他可以专门去,,,
00:32:03.080,00:32:04.240,可能是政协提案,00:32:02.920,00:32:04.240,"for instance, a CPPCC proposal,"
00:32:04.240,00:32:06.280,可能是网上的一篇文章,,,
00:32:06.600,00:32:08.440,大家热热议的一个话题,00:32:04.240,00:32:10.100,"an article on the Internet or
a research on a heated topic."
00:32:08.600,00:32:10.360,那他就来进行调研,,,
00:32:10.640,00:32:12.680,然后呢可以叫你来请进来,00:32:10.340,00:32:14.520,Then Didi will be invited to the city government
00:32:12.680,00:32:13.280,对不对,,,
00:32:13.280,00:32:14.880,到市政府里边来座,,,
00:32:14.880,00:32:16.440,谈谈你们的诉求,00:32:14.520,00:32:16.500,to talk about their demands.
00:32:16.440,00:32:17.280,然后呢,,,
00:32:17.320,00:32:18.440,我们再去做调研,00:32:16.500,00:32:18.340,Then some research will be conducted again.
00:32:18.440,00:32:20.040,这样几个来回之后,00:32:18.340,00:32:19.820,"After a few rounds,"
00:32:20.040,00:32:22.640,寻找一个大家都能接受的方法,00:32:19.820,00:32:22.500,we will find a solution that can be accepted
00:32:22.680,00:32:24.880,传统出租车行业能接受,,,
00:32:25.320,00:32:26.560,这个滴滴也能接受,00:32:22.500,00:32:27.940,"by the traditional taxi industry, Didi
and the general public."
00:32:26.560,00:32:26.800,工作,,,
00:32:26.840,00:32:27.560,也能接受,,,
00:32:27.560,00:32:29.320,我我就举这么一个例子,00:32:27.940,00:32:29.180,I give this example to illustrate that
00:32:29.320,00:32:30.800,说明我这系这个系统,,,
00:32:30.840,00:32:31.560,有这个办法,00:32:29.180,00:32:33.040,"our system does have ways to
deal with these problems."
00:32:31.560,00:32:32.960,来处理这些问题,,,
00:32:33.040,00:32:35.000,嗯从大家的问题当中,00:32:33.040,00:32:35.900,"Through your questions, I can really feel that"
00:32:35.040,00:32:36.080,真的能够感受到,,,
00:32:36.080,00:32:37.720,大家很认真的在思考,00:32:35.900,00:32:37.800,everyone is thinking deeply.
00:32:37.720,00:32:39.400,我们接下来再继续来感受,00:32:37.800,00:32:40.340,Next let us continue to hear more thoughts.
00:32:39.440,00:32:40.320,我们的这个思考,,,
00:32:40.320,00:32:41.520,唉来这位朋友,00:32:40.340,00:32:42.040,"Alright, our friend over here."
00:32:42.000,00:32:43.320,啊主持人好,00:32:42.040,00:32:44.180,"Good evening,"
00:32:43.360,00:32:44.120,张老师好,,,
00:32:44.320,00:32:44.960,我想问一下,00:32:44.180,00:32:45.280,may I ask that
00:32:44.960,00:32:47.040,就是中国研究了中国道路,00:32:45.280,00:32:48.600,"since you have studied the China Path
and the current system,"
00:32:47.040,00:32:48.520,和中国现在的制度,,,
00:32:48.560,00:32:50.680,能不能避免因贫富分化,00:32:48.600,00:32:52.000,"can China's current system avoid social unrest caused
by the polarization between the rich and the poor?"
00:32:50.720,00:32:52.040,引起的社会动荡,,,
00:32:52.040,00:32:55.000,导致了大国兴衰的那种历史规律,00:32:52.000,00:32:54.860,"Then avoid following the rule of history
that great powers rise and decline?"
00:32:55.000,00:32:55.680,好谢谢,00:32:54.860,00:32:55.580,Thank you.
00:32:55.680,00:32:56.640,好谢谢您,00:32:55.580,00:32:56.380,Thank you.
00:32:56.640,00:32:58.680,平时喜欢看历史研究历史吗,00:32:56.460,00:32:58.760,Do you like to read or study history?
,,,00:32:58.760,00:32:59.520,"Yes, I do."
00:32:58.680,00:33:01.080,噢您是做什么工作的,00:32:59.520,00:33:01.000,What line of work are you in?
00:33:01.320,00:33:03.880,我是做汽车油气那个检测的,00:33:01.000,00:33:03.640,Automotive paint testing.
00:33:03.960,00:33:05.520,哇大家看到吗,,,
00:33:05.520,00:33:08.480,所以其实不管是从事什么职业的,00:33:03.660,00:33:07.940,"So you see, no matter what occupation you are in,"
00:33:08.520,00:33:09.880,只要有这个兴趣爱好,,,
00:33:09.880,00:33:11.920,而且只要关注中国发展,00:33:07.940,00:33:11.860,"as long as you have interest in
studying China’s development,"
00:33:11.920,00:33:13.960,都能找到自己思考的角度,00:33:11.860,00:33:13.860,you can find your own perspective.
00:33:13.960,00:33:14.880,真是太棒了,00:33:13.860,00:33:15.440,It's awesome. Please have a seat.
00:33:14.880,00:33:15.720,您请坐,,,
00:33:15.760,00:33:16.400,啊谢谢,00:33:15.440,00:33:16.200,Thank you.
00:33:16.920,00:33:17.120,对,,,
00:33:17.120,00:33:20.240,实际上呃你这个分析是有道理的,00:33:16.420,00:33:20.200,"In fact, your analysis makes sense."
00:33:20.240,00:33:21.560,我们要确实是,,,
00:33:21.560,00:33:24.240,关注贫富差距的问题,00:33:20.200,00:33:23.980,"We really need to pay attention to
the gap between the rich and the poor."
00:33:24.560,00:33:25.320,呃但同时呢,00:33:24.200,00:33:25.840,"But at the same time,"
00:33:25.320,00:33:26.560,我也觉得就是,,,
00:33:26.560,00:33:28.840,中国基本找到了,00:33:25.840,00:33:31.460,"China has basically found the solution,
although it still needs improvement."
00:33:28.840,00:33:30.040,解决问题的方案,,,
00:33:30.040,00:33:31.960,但是方案可以完善啊,,,
00:33:32.200,00:33:33.440,呃我老这样说的,00:33:31.920,00:33:33.200,"I always say that,"
00:33:33.440,00:33:35.520,首先我们这个指标体系要创新,00:33:33.200,00:33:35.560,"first of all, our indicator system should be innovative."
00:33:35.520,00:33:37.960,不能完全用刚才讲那个基尼系数,00:33:35.560,00:33:37.980,"We cannot simply apply the Gini coefficient
as mentioned before."
00:33:37.960,00:33:40.040,我们要有新的指标体系,00:33:37.980,00:33:39.660,There must be a new indicator system.
00:33:40.440,00:33:42.600,那么如果你换一个角度来看呢,00:33:40.160,00:33:42.520,"If you look at it from another angle,"
00:33:42.640,00:33:44.680,你就发觉中国大致这样的,00:33:42.520,00:33:44.600,you’ll see this is basically China’s pathway of development:
00:33:44.680,00:33:46.000,就是当初最早,00:33:44.600,00:33:47.220,"At the beginning of reform and opening up,"
00:33:46.040,00:33:47.320,我们改革开放初的时候,,,
00:33:47.320,00:33:48.840,邓小平他提的是,00:33:47.220,00:33:50.160,Deng Xiaoping put forward a complete concept:
00:33:49.120,00:33:50.360,一个完整的概念,,,
00:33:50.360,00:33:53.560,一个是让一部分地区先富起来,00:33:50.160,00:33:53.380,"First, let some regions get rich,"
00:33:53.560,00:33:55.440,带动其他地区富起来,00:33:53.380,00:33:55.220,then promote prosperity in other regions;
00:33:55.720,00:33:58.400,一个呢是让一部分人先富起来,00:33:55.220,00:33:57.840,"Second,  let some people get rich first,"
00:33:58.440,00:33:59.760,来带动更多的人,00:33:57.840,00:34:01.160,"then mobilize more people
to achieve common prosperity."
00:33:59.760,00:34:01.400,所有的人实现共同富裕,,,
00:34:01.400,00:34:03.000,这是要完整的论述,00:34:01.160,00:34:03.000,That’s the full statement.
00:34:03.560,00:34:04.360,你也回头看,00:34:03.000,00:34:05.220,"If you look at the first step,"
00:34:04.360,00:34:05.400,就第一步,,,
00:34:05.480,00:34:06.880,一部分地区先富裕起来,00:34:05.220,00:34:08.420,"""Let some regions get rich first,
then promote prosperity in other regions""."
00:34:06.920,00:34:08.160,带动其他地区富裕起来,,,
00:34:08.200,00:34:09.720,这个我们基本做到了,00:34:08.420,00:34:10.040,We have basically achieved that.
00:34:09.760,00:34:12.240,唉过去将近20年,00:34:10.040,00:34:12.100,"In the past 20 years,"
00:34:12.320,00:34:14.960,整个呃中西部地区发展,00:34:12.100,00:34:14.860,Central and western China
00:34:14.960,00:34:16.280,都比沿海要快,00:34:14.860,00:34:16.400,"are developing faster than the coastal areas,"
00:34:16.440,00:34:18.240,你可以看感觉得出来的,00:34:16.400,00:34:18.400,and you can really feel it.
00:34:18.280,00:34:19.800,这个实际上也带动了当地,,,
00:34:19.800,00:34:22.360,就是呃贫困人口的脱贫,00:34:18.400,00:34:22.640,"This has actually facilitated the
poverty alleviation of the local areas."
00:34:22.360,00:34:22.600,啊,,,
00:34:22.640,00:34:24.080,我们现在是2020年,,,
00:34:24.080,00:34:25.480,要解决所有的这个,00:34:22.640,00:34:27.800,"By 2020, we will overcome all
poverty under current standards."
00:34:25.480,00:34:27.640,照现在标准的这个贫困,,,
00:34:27.680,00:34:29.080,啊这个是了不起的,00:34:27.800,00:34:29.060,This is amazing.
00:34:29.080,00:34:31.880,我叫人类历史上的一个奇迹,00:34:29.060,00:34:31.560,I personally think it is a miracle in human history.
00:34:32.080,00:34:34.360,中国现在7亿4000万人脱贫,00:34:31.560,00:34:35.880,"In China, 740 million people have been
lifted out of poverty now."
00:34:34.360,00:34:35.160,了唉,,,
00:34:35.680,00:34:38.240,呃所以这方面进步也很大,00:34:36.240,00:34:37.780,"So in this aspect, much progress has been made."
00:34:38.240,00:34:40.160,但是在这个先富的人,00:34:37.780,00:34:40.260,"However, the second part
""let some people get rich first,"
00:34:40.160,00:34:40.840,带动,,,
00:34:41.200,00:34:42.920,所有的人共同富裕,00:34:40.260,00:34:43.140,"then mobilize more people to
achieve common prosperity"""
00:34:42.920,00:34:44.840,这个我们现在还在探索,00:34:43.140,00:34:44.820,— this is still being explored.
00:34:45.000,00:34:46.320,究竟通过什么样的方法,00:34:44.820,00:34:47.560,How can we achieve this more effectively?
00:34:46.320,00:34:47.560,能更有效的做到,,,
00:34:47.600,00:34:49.160,虽然已经有不同的探索,00:34:47.560,00:34:49.180,"Although we have had several trials,"
00:34:49.160,00:34:51.480,但还没有做到最理想的状态,00:34:49.180,00:34:51.680,it has not yet reached its optimal state.
00:34:51.960,00:34:54.000,但好在就是我们这个目标非常,00:34:51.680,00:34:54.440,"Fortunately, our goal is very clear."
00:34:54.000,00:34:54.360,明确,,,
00:34:54.400,00:34:56.520,就要实现共同富裕,00:34:54.440,00:34:56.520,That is to achieve common prosperity.
00:34:56.560,00:34:58.680,而且在朝这个方向走,00:34:56.520,00:34:58.760,And we are advancing in this direction.
00:34:59.600,00:35:01.800,你讲到这个贫富差距讲什么,00:34:59.100,00:35:01.800,"When it comes to the gap between rich and poor,"
00:35:01.800,00:35:03.960,有很多人马上就会激动起来啊,00:35:01.800,00:35:04.220,many people will get excited immediately.
00:35:03.960,00:35:04.720,这个这个,,,
00:35:05.040,00:35:07.880,但你一定要看这宏观的一个把握,,,
00:35:07.920,00:35:09.160,唉要防止这种,00:35:04.700,00:35:11.920,"You must observe the bigger picture,
instead of thinking in a simple and radical way."
00:35:09.200,00:35:11.760,就是很简单的激进的思潮,,,
00:35:12.160,00:35:13.280,这个总体上,,,
00:35:13.280,00:35:16.320,中国是在朝着共同富裕的方向在,00:35:11.920,00:35:16.380,"Generally speaking, China is advancing
 towards common prosperity,"
00:35:16.320,00:35:16.720,走,,,
00:35:16.720,00:35:20.520,这个多少人这个命运得到了改变,00:35:16.380,00:35:20.600,and many people have been living a better life.
00:35:20.520,00:35:22.040,这是全世界没有地方,,,
00:35:22.040,00:35:24.440,可以看到这种变化的,00:35:20.600,00:35:24.280,"Nowhere else in the world can you
find this kind of transformation."
00:35:24.600,00:35:26.320,而且前景还继续看好,00:35:24.280,00:35:26.080,"Meanwhile, the prospect is still promising."
00:35:26.560,00:35:28.480,所以我觉得可以跳出这个,00:35:26.080,00:35:28.320,So I think we should think outside the box.
00:35:28.480,00:35:30.600,如果你说是一种循环的话,00:35:28.320,00:35:31.500,"The vicious cycle [rise and decline]
as you mentioned can be averted."
00:35:30.600,00:35:31.600,唉可以解决,,,
00:35:31.680,00:35:32.680,包括现在国家,,,
00:35:32.680,00:35:34.920,还在大力抓精准扶贫,00:35:31.500,00:35:34.840,"China is still focusing
on targeted poverty alleviation."
00:35:34.960,00:35:36.920,这个也是我们一种特殊的做法,00:35:34.840,00:35:36.800,This is also one of our special practices.
00:35:36.920,00:35:38.280,您走过那么多国家,,,
00:35:38.320,00:35:40.960,有没有地方也这样去扶贫呢,00:35:36.800,00:35:40.860,"Prof. Zhang, as you have traveled so many countries,
is there any place that alleviates poverty in this way?"
00:35:41.080,00:35:42.040,不精准扶贫,,,
00:35:42.040,00:35:44.640,实际上是一个很高的一个要求,00:35:40.860,00:35:44.560,"Targeted poverty alleviation actually
has particular requirements."
00:35:44.640,00:35:47.160,首先你的贫困的人数,00:35:44.560,00:35:48.180,"First of all, the scale of poverty-stricken
population should be relatively small,"
00:35:47.160,00:35:48.440,要相对比较少,,,
00:35:48.800,00:35:49.800,如果你是7亿人,00:35:48.180,00:35:51.260,"No targeted poverty alleviation can be conducted
with 700 million impoverished people."
00:35:49.840,00:35:51.360,就没法搞精准扶贫,,,
00:35:51.640,00:35:52.160,第二呢,,,
00:35:52.160,00:35:54.080,你政府能力要比较强,00:35:51.260,00:35:53.820,"Secondly, the government must
have a relatively strong capability"
00:35:54.080,00:35:55.800,你要能够管到基层,00:35:53.820,00:35:55.620,to be able to reach the grass roots.
00:35:55.840,00:35:57.320,这个在多数发展中国家,00:35:55.620,00:35:58.820,"Most developing countries have
not yet reached this stage."
00:35:57.360,00:35:58.880,现在没有到这个阶段,,,
00:35:59.040,00:36:02.160,唉你到一个典型的发展中国家,00:35:58.820,00:36:01.880,"As long as you have conducted field trips,
you will find that"
00:36:02.240,00:36:03.840,它有个中央政府,,,
00:36:03.840,00:36:05.600,你只要实地考察过,00:36:01.880,00:36:06.020,the central government of a typical developing country
00:36:05.600,00:36:07.360,它可能就能管一个首都,00:36:06.020,00:36:07.380,may only be able to manage the capital city.
00:36:07.360,00:36:09.360,我们到贵州最穷的地方,,,
00:36:09.680,00:36:10.960,我们的农民贫困户,00:36:07.380,00:36:12.300,"But even farmers from the poorest
places in Guizhou have bank accounts."
00:36:10.960,00:36:12.320,他都有银行卡,,,
00:36:12.600,00:36:14.520,政府这些钱打到他卡上去,00:36:12.300,00:36:14.640,"Our government can remit money
to them through their bank cards."
00:36:14.720,00:36:16.720,这现代管理的重要标志,00:36:14.640,00:36:17.900,"This is an important symbol of modern
management: digital management."
00:36:16.720,00:36:18.040,唉数字管理,,,
00:36:18.040,00:36:21.840,所以呃呃本身能够提出精准扶贫,,,
00:36:21.840,00:36:23.840,然后做这个工作,00:36:17.900,00:36:26.240,"So to propose targeted poverty alleviation,
and perform the duties are actually quite tough."
00:36:23.840,00:36:26.000,实际上是一个很不容易的一个,,,
00:36:26.000,00:36:26.480,事情,,,
00:36:26.480,00:36:28.000,你达到了相当的水平,00:36:26.300,00:36:29.080,"Only after developing to a certain level
can the government have the ability to do so."
00:36:28.000,00:36:28.960,才能这样做,,,
00:36:29.080,00:36:30.600,对改革开放40年,,,
00:36:30.600,00:36:32.320,让7.4亿人口脱贫,00:36:29.080,00:36:32.280,"Forty years of reform and opening-up
lifted 740 million people out of poverty."
00:36:32.320,00:36:34.320,接下来我们要做的事情是精准,00:36:32.280,00:36:34.580,What we need to do next is to targeted poverty alleviation.
00:36:34.320,00:36:34.840,扶贫,,,
00:36:34.840,00:36:36.760,所以其实刚才这两点结合起来,00:36:34.580,00:36:38.600,"So actually these two points combined
were trying to answer your concerns."
00:36:36.760,00:36:38.840,也是在回答这位朋友的担心,,,
00:36:38.880,00:36:40.320,当然我们都关注这个问题,00:36:38.600,00:36:40.500,We all have this kind of concern.
00:36:40.320,00:36:41.280,我们也希望就是,,,
00:36:41.280,00:36:43.880,可以更快的实现共同富裕哈,00:36:40.500,00:36:43.620,"And we also hope the common prosperity
can be achieved sooner."
00:36:43.920,00:36:45.520,我有一个问题想追问一下,00:36:43.620,00:36:45.280,"I want to ask Prof. Zhang,"
00:36:45.560,00:36:47.440,是不是所有的经济体,00:36:45.280,00:36:46.980,"Will all economies,"
00:36:47.440,00:36:49.280,当它发展到一定程度之后,00:36:46.980,00:36:49.040,"after developing to a certain level,"
00:36:49.280,00:36:50.640,会不可避免的,,,
00:36:50.640,00:36:52.840,使得最上头顶尖的人,00:36:49.040,00:36:54.860,"inevitably allow the  people at the top to seize wealth quickly,"
00:36:52.880,00:36:55.120,会快速的攫取财富,,,
00:36:55.120,00:36:56.520,而忽略了后面人的这个,00:36:54.860,00:36:57.660,leaving most people behind?
00:36:56.520,00:36:57.960,所有的这个收入的速度,,,
00:36:57.960,00:37:00.040,难道说这是一个无解的话题吗,00:36:57.860,00:36:59.740,Is this unsolvable?
00:37:00.040,00:37:01.560,呃我我是这样看到,,,
00:37:01.560,00:37:02.480,实事求是,00:36:59.740,00:37:03.620,"If you look at the facts,"
00:37:02.520,00:37:05.920,就是呃你一个像中国这样的经济,,,
00:37:05.920,00:37:06.600,增长,,,
00:37:06.600,00:37:07.480,过去40年,,,
00:37:07.480,00:37:08.720,如果你算一个总账,00:37:03.620,00:37:11.780,"China has grown at an average
annual rate of 9.5% over the past 40 years."
00:37:08.720,00:37:11.520,每年是平均增长9.5%,,,
00:37:11.920,00:37:13.920,那么像这样一个增长率的话,00:37:11.780,00:37:13.580,"With such a growth rate,"
00:37:13.920,00:37:14.800,它必然意味着,,,
00:37:14.800,00:37:17.120,每年都要创造一大批的富人,00:37:13.580,00:37:17.720,"it will necessarily generate a large number
 of rich people and entrepreneurs every year."
00:37:17.120,00:37:17.400,企业家,,,
00:37:17.400,00:37:19.840,否则不可能带动整个经济发展的,00:37:17.720,00:37:19.960,"Otherwise, it is impossible to
push economic development."
00:37:20.120,00:37:22.160,我有一个关于贫富差距的一个,00:37:19.960,00:37:22.380,"I have an observation about
the gap between rich and poor."
00:37:22.160,00:37:22.640,观察,,,
00:37:22.640,00:37:23.560,给大家分享一个故事,00:37:22.380,00:37:24.280,Let me share with you a story that touches me.
00:37:23.560,00:37:24.520,我自己特别感动,,,
00:37:24.760,00:37:25.880,一个还不到40岁的,00:37:24.280,00:37:26.180,"A story about a young entrepreneur under forty,"
00:37:25.880,00:37:27.000,年轻企业家,,,
00:37:27.000,00:37:28.400,几亿的资产,00:37:26.300,00:37:28.240,with assets worthy of hundreds of millions yuan.
00:37:28.520,00:37:29.360,前段时间大家说,,,
00:37:29.400,00:37:29.600,唉呀,,,
00:37:29.600,00:37:32.080,这个现在中国对于中小企业的税,00:37:28.240,00:37:32.840,"Recently, many people were saying
China’s taxes on SMEs are getting heavier."
00:37:32.080,00:37:32.880,越来越重了,,,
00:37:32.880,00:37:34.440,很多人往外往外跑了,00:37:32.840,00:37:35.920,"Many businesspeople cannot survive,
so they choose to invest abroad."
00:37:34.480,00:37:35.440,这个活不下去了,,,
00:37:35.480,00:37:36.080,怎么办,,,
00:37:36.360,00:37:38.680,我在不是在论坛上,00:37:35.920,00:37:39.920,"The young entrepreneur said privately, not on the forum:"
00:37:38.920,00:37:39.560,在私下里,,,
00:37:39.560,00:37:40.280,他说,,,
00:37:40.600,00:37:42.440,我们这些年积累的财富,00:37:39.920,00:37:44.740,"the wealth we have accumulated over the years
are the dividends from the policy."
00:37:42.440,00:37:44.520,不就是政策带来的红利嘛,,,
00:37:44.560,00:37:45.960,我们千万不要忘了,,,
00:37:46.560,00:37:48.720,要少部分人先富起来,00:37:44.740,00:37:48.620,"We should not forget the policy:
let some people get rich first,"
00:37:48.720,00:37:51.160,带动大部分人富起来说这些税,00:37:48.620,00:37:50.300,"then mobilize more people
to achieve common prosperity."
00:37:51.360,00:37:53.320,不就是在实现当初,00:37:50.300,00:37:55.940,So these taxes are parts of achieving the goal.
00:37:53.560,00:37:54.480,我们富起来,,,
00:37:54.480,00:37:55.960,这个政策的一部分嘛,,,
00:37:56.000,00:37:56.920,我特别感动,00:37:55.940,00:37:56.700,I was quite touched.
00:37:56.920,00:37:58.160,一个不到40岁的年轻人,00:37:56.700,00:37:58.000,"A young man under forty,"
00:37:58.160,00:37:58.680,而且呢,,,
00:37:58.680,00:38:01.280,周围的很多年轻企业家在负荷,00:37:58.000,00:38:00.780,"and many young entrepreneurs around
share the same mind."
00:38:01.320,00:38:03.240,对这些年轻的企业家也好,00:38:00.860,00:38:03.680,"For both younger and elder entrepreneurs,"
00:38:03.240,00:38:04.000,年老的企业家,,,
00:38:04.040,00:38:05.720,他们的财富来自于社会,00:38:03.680,00:38:05.640,their wealth comes from the society.
00:38:05.720,00:38:07.440,他们也回馈社会啊,00:38:05.640,00:38:07.160,They also contribute back to society.
00:38:07.600,00:38:07.720,好,,,
00:38:07.760,00:38:09.120,我们再来看我们其他朋友,00:38:07.160,00:38:09.860,"Alright, let’s see if there are more questions."
00:38:09.120,00:38:10.080,还有没有提问,,,
00:38:10.080,00:38:12.000,好这位噢两位同时举手,00:38:09.860,00:38:11.880,The two raised hands at the same time.
00:38:12.040,00:38:13.520,那我们女士先来好不好,00:38:11.880,00:38:14.420,Lady first. Please.
00:38:13.520,00:38:14.480,来,,,
00:38:16.040,00:38:17.920,中国的GDP发展得很快,00:38:15.780,00:38:17.700,"China's GDP is growing rapidly,"
00:38:17.920,00:38:19.400,嗯不少外国人认为,00:38:17.700,00:38:19.440,and many foreigners believe that
00:38:19.400,00:38:21.440,就是按照中国社会经济发展的,00:38:19.440,00:38:23.080,"due to the severity of the problems that China’s
economic development faces,"
00:38:21.480,00:38:23.480,面临的这些问题的严重性,,,
00:38:23.520,00:38:24.520,中国的经济,,,
00:38:24.520,00:38:26.600,早就应该是陷入困境的,00:38:23.080,00:38:26.600,"China’s economy should have been
in deep waters for a long time."
00:38:26.600,00:38:27.960,但是现实情况是,,,
00:38:27.960,00:38:30.040,中国的经济不但没有陷入困境,00:38:26.600,00:38:29.800,"The reality is that not only did we not get into trouble,"
00:38:30.040,00:38:32.560,反而取得了呃很大的发展,00:38:29.800,00:38:32.380,but we have made great progress instead.
00:38:32.680,00:38:34.680,嗯这也被很多西方学者,00:38:32.380,00:38:36.280,"This is also called the ""mystery of the Chinese
economy"" by many Western scholars."
00:38:34.680,00:38:36.360,称为中国经济之谜,,,
00:38:36.360,00:38:38.200,想问一下呃张教授,00:38:36.280,00:38:37.840,"I would like to ask Prof. Zhang,"
00:38:38.240,00:38:38.960,就是,,,
00:38:39.000,00:38:40.920,中国怎么在面临这么多问题的,00:38:37.840,00:38:42.860,"facing so many problems, how does China
still make such great progress?"
00:38:40.920,00:38:41.400,情况下,,,
00:38:41.400,00:38:43.000,仍然取得这么大的进步,,,
00:38:43.240,00:38:43.640,好,,,
00:38:43.640,00:38:45.040,唉我们这位年轻的朋友,,,
00:38:45.040,00:38:47.040,你是从事什么工作呢,00:38:43.360,00:38:46.860,"I'd like to ask our young friend, what do you do?"
00:38:47.040,00:38:48.080,啊我是学生啊,00:38:46.860,00:38:48.180,I am a student.
00:38:48.120,00:38:49.560,研究什么专业呢,00:38:48.180,00:38:49.560,What major are you studying?
00:38:49.560,00:38:50.960,嗯国际贸易学啊,00:38:49.560,00:38:50.540,international trade.
00:38:50.960,00:38:51.640,唉挺好,,,
00:38:51.640,00:38:53.320,跟自己这个分行有点关系哈,00:38:50.540,00:38:53.380,"Very good, it is related to your study."
00:38:53.320,00:38:54.680,请坐对,00:38:53.380,00:38:54.560,Please have a seat.
00:38:55.120,00:38:56.440,中国经济之谜啊,00:38:54.800,00:38:56.640,The mystery of the Chinese economy.
00:38:56.800,00:38:58.960,对西方首先读不懂中国,00:38:56.640,00:38:58.400,"First, the West can’t understand China."
00:38:58.960,00:39:00.760,照西方的逻辑呢,00:38:58.400,00:38:59.840,"According to their logic,"
00:39:00.760,00:39:02.200,中国要崩溃过,00:38:59.840,00:39:03.800,China’s economy has already collapsed a million times.
00:39:02.200,00:39:02.560,啊,,,
00:39:02.560,00:39:03.800,唉我是,,,
00:39:03.840,00:39:05.480,我估计基本上每两三年,,,
00:39:05.480,00:39:08.680,就有大的一个一个舆论,00:39:03.800,00:39:08.520,"Basically every two or three years,
I could hear public opinions"
00:39:08.720,00:39:10.800,说是中国即将崩溃唉,00:39:08.520,00:39:10.840,saying that China's economy is about to fall apart.
00:39:10.960,00:39:13.720,那个最最有名是那个叫张家墩,00:39:10.920,00:39:13.580,The most known is Zhang Jiadun.
00:39:13.720,00:39:15.120,唉他现在很尴尬,00:39:13.580,00:39:15.280,It is quite embarrassing.
00:39:15.120,00:39:16.840,一出来他就要笑,00:39:15.280,00:39:17.140,The audience laughs every time he appears in public.
00:39:16.840,00:39:17.120,对,,,
00:39:17.160,00:39:19.280,他就他对中国崩溃的预测,00:39:17.140,00:39:20.600,"His prediction on the breakdown of China's
economy was exact to the year and month."
00:39:19.280,00:39:21.160,是精确到年和月,,,
00:39:21.160,00:39:22.640,所以每次都,00:39:21.120,00:39:22.580,So he mispredicted every time.
00:39:22.680,00:39:25.240,吉尔吉斯他当时WTO中国加入,00:39:22.580,00:39:26.260,"When China joined the WTO in 2001,"
00:39:25.280,00:39:26.400,说2001年,,,
00:39:26.440,00:39:29.000,他5年之内中国将崩溃唉,00:39:26.260,00:39:28.580,"he said that China’s economy would
collapse in five years."
00:39:29.080,00:39:29.800,然后5年到了,,,
00:39:29.800,00:39:31.080,他说还会再晚一年,00:39:28.580,00:39:31.540,"When five years passed, he said
it would be another year later."
00:39:31.440,00:39:32.160,哈哈哈哈哈,,,
00:39:32.440,00:39:34.120,这当笑话讲了啊,00:39:32.600,00:39:34.060,Now it has been regarded as a joke.
00:39:34.440,00:39:35.640,背后是中国自己,,,
00:39:35.640,00:39:38.320,形成自己一整套的做法,00:39:34.060,00:39:37.680,"The mystery behind this is that China
has formed its own set of practices."
00:39:38.400,00:39:40.600,我叫中国模式非常厉害的,00:39:37.680,00:39:40.500,I call it the China Path. It's very impressive.
00:39:40.600,00:39:42.800,呃这个模式不是十全十美,00:39:40.500,00:39:42.700,"Although the China Path is not perfect,"
00:39:42.800,00:39:44.320,但是就现在这个水平,,,
00:39:44.320,00:39:46.320,可以跟西方模式进行竞争,00:39:42.700,00:39:46.100,"it can already compete with
the Western model at this level."
00:39:46.520,00:39:47.520,你比方说,,,
00:39:47.600,00:39:50.680,我经济上我是混合经济,00:39:46.100,00:39:50.200,"For example, our economic model
is a mixed economy,"
00:39:51.480,00:39:54.560,我是这个政府的作用,,,
00:39:54.760,00:39:56.200,就包括中央政府,00:39:50.640,00:39:59.100,"which includes the central government
for strategic planning"
00:39:56.560,00:39:59.360,我们叫进行战略规划的中央政府,,,
00:39:59.720,00:40:01.720,和竞争性的地方政府,00:39:59.100,00:40:02.940,"and local government for competitive planning,"
00:40:01.720,00:40:03.120,两个层面的,,,
00:40:03.240,00:40:04.520,再加上企业,00:40:02.940,00:40:04.440,plus companies.
00:40:04.680,00:40:07.000,所以中国经济它有三个发动机,00:40:04.440,00:40:08.740,"So the China’s economy has three engines,
while others only have two."
00:40:07.000,00:40:08.800,一般的经济只有两个发动机,,,
00:40:08.840,00:40:10.320,其实刚才这位朋友的担心,00:40:08.740,00:40:11.800,"Actually, the concern from this friend is very common."
00:40:10.360,00:40:11.720,我想也是很多人的担心,,,
00:40:11.720,00:40:13.680,就确实我们听到很多观点说,,,
00:40:13.680,00:40:15.160,中国经济要不行了,00:40:11.800,00:40:16.440,"Indeed, we hear many negative opinions
about China’s economy."
00:40:15.160,00:40:16.760,我会怎么怎么样,,,
00:40:16.760,00:40:18.200,所以大家也在担心,00:40:16.440,00:40:19.820,"So people are worrying about
themselves and also the country."
00:40:18.240,00:40:19.840,担心自己也担心国家,,,
00:40:19.880,00:40:21.720,但事实上我们一路走来,00:40:19.820,00:40:21.700,But in fact we have walked all the way.
00:40:21.760,00:40:23.320,说明我们还是有很多经验,00:40:21.700,00:40:24.700,"We still have a lot of experience and
are dealing with many problems."
00:40:23.320,00:40:25.040,我们在处理很多问题,,,
00:40:25.040,00:40:26.960,这些隐忧我们也在关注,00:40:24.700,00:40:26.760,We are also paying attention to these hidden worries.
00:40:26.960,00:40:29.360,所以还是要有信心哈,00:40:26.760,00:40:28.500,We should be confident.
00:40:29.360,00:40:29.560,对,00:40:28.500,00:40:29.700,This is China.
00:40:29.560,00:40:31.440,这就是中国说的很好,00:40:29.700,00:40:31.260,"Yes, this is China. Well said."
00:40:31.760,00:40:33.480,这就是中国,00:40:31.260,00:40:33.340,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:40:33.480,00:40:35.760,听张维为说这位朋友,00:40:33.580,00:40:36.300,"Our friend over here, who raised his hand just now."
00:40:36.120,00:40:36.720,唉您好,,,
00:40:36.720,00:40:37.160,张老师,00:40:36.300,00:40:37.940,"- Good evening Prof. Zhang and host.
- Welcome."
00:40:37.160,00:40:38.040,主持人您好,,,
00:40:38.040,00:40:39.320,谈到贫富差距,00:40:37.940,00:40:40.520,"When it comes to the gap between rich and poor,"
00:40:39.320,00:40:40.720,当有个人问你,,,
00:40:40.960,00:40:43.040,他不问你收入做什么行业,00:40:40.520,00:40:42.800,people don’t care about your income and your job.
00:40:43.040,00:40:44.840,他就问你居住在哪里,00:40:42.800,00:40:43.960,They just ask where you live.
00:40:44.880,00:40:46.160,你说我住在郊区,,,
00:40:46.160,00:40:47.760,比如说你居住在南汇,00:40:43.960,00:40:48.980,"If you say that you live in the suburbs [of Shanghai]
like Nanhui or Hangtou,"
00:40:47.760,00:40:49.040,居住的行头,,,
00:40:49.040,00:40:49.920,人家说这个人呢,,,
00:40:49.920,00:40:51.320,肯定就是没有什么收入,00:40:48.980,00:40:52.820,"they will think that you belong to
the middle and low-income group."
00:40:51.320,00:40:53.080,本身就是一个中低收入的人,,,
00:40:53.080,00:40:54.000,居住在杭州,00:40:52.820,00:40:54.120,Do you live in Hangtou?
00:40:54.000,00:40:54.760,对我,00:40:54.120,00:40:54.680,Yeah.
00:40:54.920,00:40:55.520,离我家挺近的,00:40:54.680,00:40:55.700,We are quite close.
00:40:55.520,00:40:55.960,我也,,,
00:40:56.280,00:40:56.360,对,,,
00:40:56.400,00:40:58.000,所以咱俩是,00:40:55.700,00:40:58.380,I also live in that area. So we are neighbors.
00:40:58.040,00:41:00.000,我本来是居住在市区嘛,00:40:58.380,00:41:01.300,I used to live in Huangpu District downtown.
00:41:00.040,00:41:01.440,黄埔区的,,,
00:41:01.720,00:41:03.200,后来这样一问就是说,00:41:01.300,00:41:04.360,"In other words, will this reflect
the gap between rich and poor?"
00:41:03.240,00:41:04.120,会不会贫富差距,,,
00:41:04.120,00:41:06.600,人家说有钱人都是居住市区的,00:41:04.360,00:41:08.420,"The so-called rich people live in the city or downtown,"
00:41:06.640,00:41:08.840,都是市中心寸土寸金的,,,
00:41:08.840,00:41:09.240,没钱了,,,
00:41:09.240,00:41:10.720,只能在边远的城市,00:41:08.420,00:41:11.580,while poor people can only live in remote suburbs.
00:41:10.760,00:41:11.840,城郊结合部,,,
00:41:11.880,00:41:12.920,这样一个看法,,,
00:41:12.960,00:41:14.320,你这个问题实际上,,,
00:41:14.600,00:41:15.160,请坐,00:41:12.040,00:41:17.300,"- You're actually talking about ...
-Have a seat. He's talking about individual feelings."
00:41:15.160,00:41:16.800,他其实讲的还是个体的感觉,,,
00:41:17.280,00:41:19.680,涉及到一个文化层面的问题了,00:41:17.300,00:41:19.480,Your question actually belongs to the cultural level.
00:41:19.680,00:41:20.920,这个问题就是,,,
00:41:20.920,00:41:23.840,你看过去中国改革开放这个三四,00:41:19.480,00:41:24.280,"In the past 30 to 40 years of reform and opening up,"
00:41:23.840,00:41:24.840,十年啊,,,
00:41:24.840,00:41:26.880,特别住房情况的变化,00:41:24.280,00:41:26.740,housing conditions have been largely changed.
00:41:27.240,00:41:29.080,呃实际上呃也许说不定,,,
00:41:29.120,00:41:30.560,呃回头看啊,00:41:26.740,00:41:33.060,"Years later, your choice today might be the best."
00:41:30.600,00:41:32.800,你的选择是最好的,,,
00:41:32.800,00:41:34.720,选择是真是这样的,00:41:33.260,00:41:34.940,That's true.
00:41:35.280,00:41:36.120,另外呢,,,
00:41:36.120,00:41:37.600,你是上海本地人,00:41:35.140,00:41:37.340,"You are a local,"
00:41:37.600,00:41:38.840,所以你的概念比较强,00:41:37.340,00:41:38.820,so you feel strongly about this.
00:41:38.840,00:41:39.760,是历史上就这样,,,
00:41:39.760,00:41:40.760,100年前也这样的,00:41:38.820,00:41:40.700,This was also the case a hundred years ago.
00:41:40.800,00:41:42.480,上海叫上只角下只角,00:41:40.700,00:41:42.640,"Shanghai was separated into the upper corner
and the lower corner."
00:41:42.480,00:41:43.040,对不对,,,
00:41:43.040,00:41:44.320,就是好地段,00:41:42.720,00:41:45.040,One is a good location and the other is bad.
00:41:44.320,00:41:45.040,坏地段,,,
00:41:45.200,00:41:46.440,这个在上海特别强,,,
00:41:46.480,00:41:47.480,因为叫斯拉伯,00:41:45.040,00:41:49.020,"This phenomenon is called ""snobbish"" in English."
00:41:47.480,00:41:48.520,就是非常势利,,,
00:41:48.560,00:41:49.280,你知道吗,,,
00:41:49.320,00:41:51.240,唉这个大城市的毛病唉,00:41:49.020,00:41:51.260,This is a common problem in big cities.
00:41:51.640,00:41:53.520,实际上只有完全可以摆脱的,00:41:51.260,00:41:53.580,"In fact, this mindset can totally be discarded."
00:41:53.560,00:41:56.080,你看现在这个呃新上海人,00:41:53.580,00:41:57.720,"The new Shanghainese don't
care about these things at all."
00:41:56.120,00:41:58.120,他根本不在乎这些东西唉,,,
00:41:58.480,00:42:00.000,嗯他觉得这个地方好,00:41:57.880,00:41:59.920,They will live where they like.
00:42:00.240,00:42:01.280,毕竟你看浦东,00:41:59.920,00:42:02.200,I live in Pudong now.
00:42:01.280,00:42:02.440,我现在住在浦东,,,
00:42:02.480,00:42:04.320,你回头看40年前,00:42:02.320,00:42:05.680,"Forty years ago, no one wanted to live in Pudong."
00:42:04.320,00:42:05.600,谁想愿意到浦东啊,,,
00:42:05.600,00:42:07.280,现在浦东多时髦的概念,00:42:05.680,00:42:07.500,But now Pudong is now in trend.
00:42:07.280,00:42:07.920,对不对,,,
00:42:08.080,00:42:09.360,这行头以后不得了的,00:42:07.500,00:42:10.460,"I’ve been to Hangtou, and I think it has
good [future] prospects."
00:42:09.400,00:42:10.000,我去过,,,
00:42:10.000,00:42:11.000,你还有一个古镇,,,
00:42:11.000,00:42:11.800,我跟你说,00:42:10.460,00:42:11.880,It also has a historical town.
00:42:11.800,00:42:14.520,那个文化资产发掘出来以后,00:42:11.880,00:42:14.520,"After the cultural resources are leveraged,"
00:42:14.520,00:42:16.840,那地方跟今天周庄什么一样,00:42:14.520,00:42:16.920,"maybe it will become the next Zhouzhuang.
[a well-known canal town]"
00:42:17.280,00:42:18.640,呃多少人会羡慕,,,
00:42:18.680,00:42:20.520,哇你住在古镇边上,00:42:17.200,00:42:20.440,Many people will envy you living near the old town.
00:42:20.560,00:42:22.080,所以我觉得是文化概念,00:42:20.440,00:42:22.840,"So I think the cultural mindset will change,"
00:42:22.080,00:42:23.240,这是可以变迁的,,,
00:42:23.240,00:42:24.280,而且我们看到,,,
00:42:24.280,00:42:26.040,他这样一步步变的唉,00:42:22.980,00:42:25.780,"and we can really see the changes
happening step by step."
00:42:26.200,00:42:28.320,其实嗯跟这位朋友讲的,,,
00:42:28.360,00:42:30.040,我其实可以例举出,00:42:25.940,00:42:32.800,I can actually list many benefits of living in Hangtou.
00:42:30.080,00:42:30.880,很多条,,,
00:42:30.920,00:42:32.600,住在行头的好处,,,
00:42:32.680,00:42:33.240,对不对,,,
00:42:33.280,00:42:36.400,呃空气也比市区要干净一点,00:42:32.800,00:42:36.180,The air is cleaner than the urban area.
00:42:36.400,00:42:38.720,另外你上下班不太要拥堵,00:42:36.180,00:42:38.620,"In addition, it has better commutes,"
00:42:38.760,00:42:39.480,买个菜什么的,,,
00:42:39.520,00:42:40.640,也都很方便,00:42:38.620,00:42:40.440,and is convenient for grocery shopping.
00:42:40.640,00:42:42.000,很安静一点,00:42:40.440,00:42:41.860,The surroundings are very quiet.
00:42:42.000,00:42:43.720,都不会受市区的这种干扰,00:42:41.860,00:42:43.780,No interference from downtown areas.
00:42:43.720,00:42:45.080,所以刚才张老师说了,00:42:43.780,00:42:44.940,Just like Prof. Zhang said
00:42:45.080,00:42:46.400,越是随着发展,00:42:44.940,00:42:46.480,"the more our society develops,"
00:42:46.400,00:42:47.200,你越是会觉得,,,
00:42:47.200,00:42:47.640,以往,,,
00:42:47.640,00:42:49.200,你觉得好像不太足的地方,00:42:46.480,00:42:50.740,"the more you will feel the inadequacies
will become advantages in the future."
00:42:49.200,00:42:50.640,将来都会变成优势,,,
00:42:50.640,00:42:52.800,它是一个不停的在转换的过程,00:42:50.740,00:42:52.740,It is a non-stop transformation.
00:42:52.800,00:42:54.600,所以我希望其实我们每一个人,,,
00:42:54.600,00:42:56.240,都可以在中国的发展当中,00:42:52.740,00:42:57.580,"So I hope each of us can enjoy this
transformation in China’s development."
00:42:56.240,00:42:57.920,享受这种转换,,,
00:42:57.920,00:43:00.040,享受这种新的意义的挖掘,00:42:57.580,00:42:59.860,Enjoy the explorations in a new sense.
00:43:00.080,00:43:01.120,这个特别棒,00:42:59.860,00:43:01.000,It will be great.
00:43:01.120,00:43:01.520,赵老师,,,
00:43:01.520,00:43:03.000,我们说到观察中国,00:43:01.000,00:43:03.000,"Prof. Zhang, you said that when observing China,"
00:43:03.000,00:43:04.200,呃不要盲人摸象,00:43:03.000,00:43:04.260,"we should avoid being ""blind men and an elephant""."
00:43:04.200,00:43:05.000,最后也想问一下,00:43:04.260,00:43:05.320,"In the end, I would like to ask"
00:43:05.000,00:43:05.200,您,,,
00:43:05.200,00:43:06.240,还有什么期许,,,
00:43:06.280,00:43:07.360,想跟大家讲,00:43:05.320,00:43:07.340,is there any other advice you have?
00:43:07.680,00:43:08.800,呃我就觉得,,,
00:43:08.800,00:43:09.520,就是,,,
00:43:09.520,00:43:13.080,指标体系创新刻不容缓,00:43:07.340,00:43:12.900,I think it is urgent to innovate the indicator system.
00:43:13.200,00:43:14.000,以西方玩,,,
00:43:14.000,00:43:16.240,这个玩的是如火纯青,00:43:12.900,00:43:15.840,The West is quite good at it.
00:43:16.280,00:43:17.760,唉动不动就弄个指标,00:43:15.840,00:43:17.840,One indicator after another.
00:43:17.760,00:43:19.440,这个哥们你看看这个破绽,00:43:17.840,00:43:20.380,But they are all easy to crack [to find flaws in].
00:43:19.440,00:43:20.640,到处都是破绽,,,
00:43:20.640,00:43:21.880,他还敢用唉,00:43:20.380,00:43:21.640,But they still dare to use them.
00:43:21.920,00:43:23.080,所以我觉得这方面,00:43:21.640,00:43:23.100,"So I think from this aspect,"
00:43:23.080,00:43:24.000,我们这一块,,,
00:43:24.000,00:43:24.960,我们的学生,00:43:23.100,00:43:26.260,"first, our scholars should not be bamboozled;"
00:43:25.000,00:43:25.280,第一,,,
00:43:25.280,00:43:26.400,不要被他们忽悠,,,
00:43:26.560,00:43:28.600,要形成自己的指标体系,00:43:26.260,00:43:28.700,"second, we need to establish our own indicator system,"
00:43:28.600,00:43:29.560,让你这指标来看,,,
00:43:29.560,00:43:31.800,西方看整个世界,00:43:28.700,00:43:31.360,and use it to observe the West and the whole world.
00:43:31.840,00:43:33.400,好好谢谢张老师,00:43:31.360,00:43:33.220,"Alright, thank you Prof. Zhang."
00:43:33.440,00:43:35.440,掌声再次送给张老师,00:43:33.220,00:43:35.220,Another round of pplause to Prof. Zhang .
00:43:38.320,00:43:40.560,中国已经崛起是和平的崛起,00:43:38.460,00:43:40.420,China has risen in peace.
00:43:40.720,00:43:41.640,这个你经济好了,,,
00:43:41.640,00:43:42.720,可是你素质没跟上来,00:43:40.420,00:43:43.460,"The economy has been developed,
but people are still bad-mannered."
00:43:42.840,00:43:43.240,拉呀,,,
00:43:43.280,00:43:46.080,是否一定是竞争大过于合作,00:43:43.460,00:43:45.980,"Must it be that competition is
greater than cooperation?"
00:43:46.400,00:43:47.720,绝大多数中国人在改革开放的,00:43:45.980,00:43:48.580,"The vast majority of Chinese benefit
from the reform and opening up."
00:43:47.720,00:43:48.360,过程中,,,
00:43:48.400,00:43:49.440,受益的,,,
00:43:49.640,00:43:52.240,这就是中国听张维,00:43:48.580,00:43:52.400,"Translators: The Magpie Bridge Brigade 鹊桥小队翻译组
