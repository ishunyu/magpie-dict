00:00:03.320,00:00:04.480,中国人出国之后,,,
00:00:04.680,00:00:06.640,我叫做一出国就爱国,00:00:03.120,00:00:06.620,"I say the Chinese people ""go abroad and love China more""."
00:00:06.680,00:00:08.040,您第1次出国的时候,00:00:06.620,00:00:08.800,What did you take with you the first time you travelled abroad?
00:00:08.080,00:00:08.560,的是什么,,,
00:00:08.600,00:00:10.040,你干嘛把它上纲上线,,,
00:00:10.040,00:00:11.320,跟政治经济挂钩,00:00:08.800,00:00:11.440,Why would you make it about [China's] politics and economy?
00:00:11.720,00:00:13.160,党说要依靠群众,00:00:11.620,00:00:13.940,"The Communist Party said we must
rely on the masses and mobilize the masses."
00:00:13.160,00:00:13.840,发动群众,,,
00:00:13.840,00:00:15.800,能不能发挥我们群中这样的力量,00:00:13.940,00:00:15.840,Can we bring out the power of the people?
00:00:15.840,00:00:16.480,观察中国,,,
00:00:16.520,00:00:18.400,既要看静静也要看,00:00:15.840,00:00:19.420,"We need both a close-up and a long shot
when we observe China, don't we?"
00:00:18.480,00:00:19.080,景对吗,,,
00:00:19.080,00:00:21.520,90 95后是中国最自信的,00:00:19.420,00:00:22.360,"The post-90s and post-95s are
the most confident generation in China."
00:00:21.520,00:00:24.520,O to AC用脚投票,00:00:22.360,00:00:24.700,"""Vote by feet."""
00:00:24.600,00:00:26.320,这就是中国,,,
00:00:26.320,00:00:28.080,听张维为说,00:00:24.840,00:00:28.040,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:00:30.240,00:00:30.840,当时我,,,
00:00:30.880,00:00:32.440,讲的一出国就爱国,00:00:29.960,00:00:32.600,"I said ""go abroad and love China more"""
00:00:32.600,00:00:33.560,主要是针对,,,
00:00:34.200,00:00:35.880,一人老是黑中国,00:00:32.860,00:00:35.735,because people where shaming China.
00:00:35.880,00:00:36.120,说,,,
00:00:36.160,00:00:37.840,你看中国人都要出国,00:00:36.100,00:00:39.220,"They were like ""All the Chinese people want to emigrate."""
00:00:37.840,00:00:38.000,都,,,
00:00:38.040,00:00:38.560,都要,,,
00:00:38.600,00:00:39.320,一个移民,,,
00:00:39.320,00:00:40.280,然后我说娜,,,
00:00:40.320,00:00:40.520,好,,,
00:00:40.680,00:00:41.480,就送他们走,00:00:39.760,00:00:41.675,"And I said, ""That's good. We will send them abroad."""
00:00:41.720,00:00:42.760,走的越多越好,00:00:41.680,00:00:43.820,"""They are welcome to leave and emigrate, aren't they?"""
00:00:42.760,00:00:43.760,鼓励他们移民,,,
00:00:45.400,00:00:45.960,好的,,,
00:00:46.080,00:00:47.520,今天我们的都到了,00:00:45.520,00:00:47.620,"OK, everyone's here."
00:00:47.880,00:00:48.760,大家都做好了,,,
00:00:48.760,00:00:49.480,都记住自己,00:00:48.060,00:00:50.180,"Please remember your seat, everyone."
00:00:49.520,00:00:49.680,位置,,,
00:00:51.600,00:00:52.400,来了我看一下,00:00:51.500,00:00:53.400,"Here, I'll take a look."
00:00:57.160,00:00:59.200,我们这次的编前会是最不想编天,00:00:57.360,00:00:59.680,This doesn't feel like a production meeting.
00:00:59.200,00:01:00.560,会聊着,,,
00:01:00.560,00:01:01.720,我们自己聊嗨了,00:00:59.680,00:01:01.480,We got high talking about it.
00:01:07.320,00:01:08.360,先问大家一个问题,,,
00:01:08.400,00:01:09.440,如果你出国,00:01:07.500,00:01:11.100,"I'd like to ask everyone what you would bring
if you could only bring one thing on a trip abroad."
00:01:09.440,00:01:10.680,只能带一件东西,,,
00:01:10.680,00:01:11.240,你会带,,,
00:01:11.360,00:01:12.880,手机支付,00:01:11.640,00:01:13.135,Mobile payment.
00:01:12.920,00:01:14.920,昨天我看到一个说法,,,
00:01:14.920,00:01:17.080,说瑞典要在2035年,,,
00:01:17.080,00:01:18.640,成为世界上第1个,00:01:13.540,00:01:21.320,"I saw this yesterday that Sweden will claim
to be the first cashless country by 2035."
00:01:18.640,00:01:21.560,完全无纸币支付的国家,,,
00:01:21.600,00:01:23.000,我就我在想,,,
00:01:23.000,00:01:24.560,中国到2035年的时候,00:01:21.680,00:01:26.440,It got me thinking where China is at in 2035.
00:01:24.560,00:01:26.720,估计又不定跨了几步出去,,,
00:01:26.760,00:01:28.000,你能想象到我,,,
00:01:28.320,00:01:29.640,十几年前去英国,00:01:26.740,00:01:30.380,"Can you imagine what I brought when I went to the UK
for the first time over a decade ago?"
00:01:29.640,00:01:30.440,我带什么,,,
00:01:30.600,00:01:33.320,我带的是家乡的咸菜泡笋,00:01:30.780,00:01:33.300,I brought pickled cabbage and bamboo shoots from my hometown.
00:01:33.480,00:01:34.520,我们家的老人,,,
00:01:34.560,00:01:37.200,是挖了一把土给我,00:01:33.600,00:01:36.040,My family gave me a handful of soil.
00:01:37.360,00:01:37.800,带把,,,
00:01:38.320,00:01:39.120,就家乡的土,00:01:37.580,00:01:39.040,Soil from my hometown.
00:01:39.120,00:01:40.840,而且拿个小袋子装好,00:01:39.040,00:01:42.260,It was put in a small bag and packed at the bottom of my suitcase.
00:01:40.880,00:01:42.280,就放在行李箱的底层,,,
00:01:42.280,00:01:42.760,对我,,,
00:01:42.800,00:01:43.440,我现在说实话,,,
00:01:43.440,00:01:45.720,如果是短期出国的话,00:01:42.520,00:01:45.340,"Personally speaking, if I go on a short trip abroad,"
00:01:46.240,00:01:46.800,还不在什么,00:01:45.400,00:01:47.440,there's really nothing that I have to bring.
00:01:46.800,00:01:47.640,无所谓了,,,
00:01:47.680,00:01:48.320,如果长期,,,
00:01:48.360,00:01:50.240,我更想把周围的一种环境,00:01:47.640,00:01:51.920,"But for a long-term stay, I'd like to bring the
vibe or the small environment around me."
00:01:50.240,00:01:52.120,或者情绪气氛带过去,,,
00:01:52.160,00:01:54.320,你希望把你的这种亲情的关系,00:01:52.200,00:01:54.160,My family ties.
00:01:54.360,00:01:55.840,父母什么爱人,00:01:54.620,00:01:57.000,"My parents, my partner, my children."
00:01:55.840,00:01:57.000,孩子一起都带过去,,,
00:01:57.040,00:01:58.240,就是这样的一个小的环境,00:01:57.160,00:01:58.580,A small environment like this.
00:01:58.240,00:02:00.840,因为以往我们知道出国工作,,,
00:02:00.880,00:02:02.360,很多都是抛家舍业的,00:01:58.780,00:02:03.440,"We know for a fact that many people in the past
had to give up their family when they worked abroad."
00:02:02.360,00:02:02.640,对不对,,,
00:02:02.640,00:02:03.280,真的是,,,
00:02:03.320,00:02:03.760,另外还有一个,,,
00:02:03.760,00:02:04.080,就是,,,
00:02:04.080,00:02:06.680,我前年看过一个纪录片叫旅行,00:02:03.620,00:02:07.400,I remember watching a documentary called On The Road [侣行].
00:02:06.680,00:02:08.600,就一对夫妻去全世界各地旅行,,,
00:02:08.600,00:02:10.400,经过战乱很多地方,00:02:07.620,00:02:10.340,"It's about a couple travelling around the world
and they experienced wars and so on."
00:02:10.560,00:02:12.360,最让我感动的一句话就是,00:02:10.720,00:02:13.500,There was one sentence that really touched me.
00:02:12.840,00:02:13.720,说的很大,,,
00:02:13.720,00:02:16.120,就是说这个世界并不和平,00:02:13.500,00:02:18.440,"[We didn't know that] The world is not in peace
because we live in a peaceful country."
00:02:16.120,00:02:18.120,是因为我们生长在一个安全的,,,
00:02:18.120,00:02:18.520,国家,,,
00:02:18.560,00:02:19.560,上海的这种,,,
00:02:19.600,00:02:20.520,曾民警,00:02:18.740,00:02:21.940,The Shanghai Police have to deal with all kinds of issues.
00:02:20.520,00:02:22.080,他们处理各种各样的问题,,,
00:02:22.160,00:02:23.600,比如说涉及到治安的,00:02:22.115,00:02:24.755,"Not only public security and criminal cases,"
00:02:23.600,00:02:24.800,涉及到案件的,,,
00:02:24.840,00:02:26.360,还有一些它是很琐碎的,00:02:24.755,00:02:27.695,"but also trivial matters like opening a lock,"
00:02:26.360,00:02:27.720,比如说帮人去开个锁,,,
00:02:27.960,00:02:28.920,帮人到车底下去,00:02:27.695,00:02:29.865,or rescuing a cat under a car.
00:02:28.960,00:02:29.720,就个猫,,,
00:02:29.960,00:02:30.800,大家已经习惯了,,,
00:02:30.800,00:02:32.200,去享受习惯了,00:02:29.865,00:02:32.925,We are so used to enjoying and recognizing [their service].
00:02:32.440,00:02:33.280,去感知,,,
00:02:33.320,00:02:34.080,但是忘掉了,,,
00:02:34.080,00:02:35.840,并不是每一个地方,00:02:32.925,00:02:37.020,And we forgot that it's not like this everywhere in the world.
00:02:35.880,00:02:36.760,都是这样,,,
00:02:36.880,00:02:38.360,你们说的要让我想起,,,
00:02:38.360,00:02:39.360,还有一个前提,00:02:37.120,00:02:39.920,This also reminded me another premise.
00:02:39.360,00:02:40.080,你忘了,,,
00:02:40.120,00:02:41.720,就是当你出去以后,00:02:39.920,00:02:41.575,"When we go abroad,"
00:02:41.720,00:02:43.240,你的这张脸,00:02:41.575,00:02:44.335,"you face, the color of your skin,"
00:02:43.240,00:02:44.520,你的肤色,,,
00:02:44.520,00:02:46.080,会给你自己贴上标签,00:02:44.340,00:02:47.460,will become a label of you.
00:02:46.120,00:02:48.640,你在中国是无法体会到,,,
00:02:48.680,00:02:50.080,种族歧视的,00:02:47.460,00:02:50.860,In China you can't experience the true meaning of racism.
00:02:50.080,00:02:51.320,真正的概念的,,,
00:02:51.360,00:02:52.920,我们就举美国为例子,00:02:51.400,00:02:53.540,"If we take America as an example,"
00:02:52.920,00:02:53.560,有一些议题,,,
00:02:53.600,00:02:54.240,在美国国内,,,
00:02:54.240,00:02:56.120,它是绝对的政治正确,00:02:53.540,00:02:57.840,the propositions of some groups are absolutely politically correct.
00:02:56.120,00:02:58.080,它某些人群的主张,,,
00:02:58.080,00:02:59.680,但是他们说亚裔,,,
00:02:59.800,00:03:01.160,他是连政治正确的地位,00:02:58.140,00:03:03.000,"But they say the Asian expats cannot even
attain a place in political correctness."
00:03:01.160,00:03:02.320,都还达不到,,,
00:03:02.360,00:03:03.040,我们国内,,,
00:03:03.040,00:03:04.640,不管是我们自己,00:03:03.360,00:03:05.880,"Whether it's Han people and the ethnic minorities,"
00:03:04.640,00:03:05.040,汉族,,,
00:03:05.040,00:03:06.160,跟少数民族的关系,,,
00:03:06.200,00:03:07.640,还是我们对外国人的关系,00:03:05.880,00:03:08.160,"or the Chinese people and foreigners,"
00:03:07.640,00:03:10.080,基本上都是在一个非常平等,00:03:08.160,00:03:11.940,we co-exist on an equal footing.
00:03:10.080,00:03:12.080,非常对等的关系下存在的,,,
00:03:12.120,00:03:13.160,我有一个好朋友,,,
00:03:13.160,00:03:14.000,台湾的一个好朋友,,,
00:03:14.000,00:03:16.600,他跟一个英国男朋友交往,00:03:11.980,00:03:16.240,I have a friend from Taiwan who was dating a British guy.
00:03:16.600,00:03:19.080,最后因为说你好不像中国人,00:03:16.520,00:03:20.060,"But she got mad when he said ""You don't look Chinese."""
00:03:19.120,00:03:20.160,他就可以跟他翻脸,,,
00:03:20.200,00:03:21.480,这种其实在欧洲,,,
00:03:21.480,00:03:23.480,还是很常见的情况,00:03:20.060,00:03:23.340,This is still quite common in Europe.
00:03:23.760,00:03:26.520,当看到比较举止文雅的,00:03:23.620,00:03:28.020,"When they see well-mannered Asians,"
00:03:26.520,00:03:28.000,亚洲人面孔的时候,,,
00:03:28.000,00:03:29.000,他们还会老套的问,,,
00:03:29.080,00:03:29.240,你,,,
00:03:29.240,00:03:30.160,是不是日本人,00:03:28.260,00:03:30.300,Europeans might stereotypically ask if they are from Japan.
00:03:30.200,00:03:31.560,这种流向中国人,00:03:30.300,00:03:32.440,"Yeah. ""You don't look Chinese."""
00:03:31.560,00:03:33.440,对这种感觉其实是很难受的,,,
00:03:33.480,00:03:35.840,那么未必一定有很深的恶意,00:03:32.440,00:03:34.840,That would make me really uncomfortable.
00:03:35.840,00:03:37.240,只不过缺乏了解,00:03:34.900,00:03:37.520,"They might not have any bad intentions.
They just don't know us well enough."
00:03:37.360,00:03:38.080,所以这里面来讲,,,
00:03:38.080,00:03:39.280,就是说每一个中国人来讲,,,
00:03:39.320,00:03:40.520,如果说利用自己,00:03:37.520,00:03:41.740,"If every Chinese expat can take the
opportunity to interact with them,"
00:03:40.560,00:03:41.760,和他们交往这种机会,,,
00:03:41.800,00:03:43.040,那么为自己的国家,,,
00:03:43.080,00:03:44.440,这种形象的变化,00:03:41.980,00:03:45.380,"and make the effort to show the changing image of China,"
00:03:44.440,00:03:46.480,来做出自己的努力和触动的话,,,
00:03:46.560,00:03:48.280,那么对外交往的意义,00:03:45.760,00:03:48.260,we will have more meaningful international exchanges.
00:03:48.520,00:03:50.520,出来国家的经济发展起来以后,,,
00:03:50.520,00:03:51.560,这个时候有更多的人,00:03:48.680,00:03:53.260,"With a rising economy, more Chinese people can afford to go abroad."
00:03:51.600,00:03:52.520,有经济实力,,,
00:03:52.520,00:03:53.600,走出国门沟通,,,
00:03:53.600,00:03:54.520,跟了解的过程,00:03:53.260,00:03:55.440,They will drive the cycles of communication and understanding.
00:03:54.560,00:03:55.280,就赚起来,,,
00:03:55.320,00:03:57.120,一开始可能就是每个人,,,
00:03:57.200,00:03:57.760,就觉得,,,
00:03:57.760,00:03:58.840,因为世界看我们的时候,00:03:55.440,00:04:01.040,"In the beginning, we felt a sense of mission
because the world viewed us with biases."
00:03:58.880,00:03:59.200,未必都,,,
00:03:59.240,00:03:59.720,那么公众,,,
00:03:59.760,00:04:00.800,每个人带着一种使命,,,
00:04:00.800,00:04:01.080,对吧,,,
00:04:01.080,00:04:03.000,慢慢的我觉得进入了一个自然的,00:04:01.100,00:04:03.580,And we gradually became more natural.
00:04:03.000,00:04:03.360,状态,,,
00:04:03.360,00:04:03.640,对吧,,,
00:04:03.640,00:04:04.280,自然的状态,,,
00:04:04.280,00:04:04.680,就是说,,,
00:04:04.680,00:04:05.520,我该什么样子,00:04:03.580,00:04:06.220,Just show them how I am.
00:04:05.560,00:04:06.160,就是什么样子,,,
00:04:06.200,00:04:06.600,到最后,,,
00:04:07.040,00:04:07.920,给大家展示一点,00:04:06.220,00:04:09.080,And in the end we tell them this is China.
00:04:07.960,00:04:08.800,就说这就是中国,,,
00:04:08.800,00:04:09.160,为什么,,,
00:04:09.160,00:04:09.680,中国本身,,,
00:04:09.680,00:04:11.360,不是一个贬义词,00:04:09.080,00:04:11.600,China is not a derogatory word.
00:04:11.360,00:04:13.400,本身大家能够客观的看待你,00:04:11.600,00:04:13.460,They are able to view us objectively.
00:04:13.440,00:04:14.520,我们都做电视的,,,
00:04:14.520,00:04:16.880,就知道一一个地方一个物体,00:04:13.460,00:04:19.060,"As media professionals, we know we must show
the close-up, the mid-shot, and the long shot of a place."
00:04:16.920,00:04:18.680,我们把它全面的展现远景,,,
00:04:18.680,00:04:19.640,中景晋级,,,
00:04:19.680,00:04:21.400,所以我觉得我们走出去,00:04:19.940,00:04:22.360,Going out is a long shot for us.
00:04:21.440,00:04:22.560,就是一个远景,,,
00:04:22.600,00:04:24.400,其实对自己来好好的认知,,,
00:04:24.400,00:04:26.800,当下认知所生活的环境,00:04:22.440,00:04:26.880,"It's an important perspective to help us
understand the environment we are in."
00:04:26.800,00:04:27.800,是特别重要,,,
00:04:27.920,00:04:29.560,因为现在中国普通老百姓,,,
00:04:29.560,00:04:30.880,太多了,00:04:28.040,00:04:31.475,The Chinese people are well-travelled.
00:04:30.880,00:04:31.520,这种感觉,,,
00:04:31.640,00:04:33.720,真的是很多人的这样的感觉,00:04:31.480,00:04:34.280,I believe a lot of people feel the same way.
00:04:33.720,00:04:34.880,我就怕共鸣来的,,,
00:04:34.880,00:04:35.520,太早,00:04:34.280,00:04:36.080,I'm afraid the audience will resonate too early.
00:04:38.360,00:04:39.200,现场的观众,00:04:37.480,00:04:41.580,"They will be like ""This is it.""
And we finish the episode too soon."
00:04:41.240,00:04:41.720,对,,,
00:04:44.160,00:04:47.800,这就是中国青张维为说,00:04:44.200,00:04:47.640,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:04:49.920,00:04:51.040,不同观点可以互,00:04:49.240,00:04:52.340,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:04:51.320,00:04:52.880,讨论辩论,,,
00:04:54.000,00:04:54.400,我们一点,,,
00:04:54.440,00:04:55.960,点都不害怕竞争,00:04:54.040,00:04:56.100,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:04:56.400,00:04:57.960,中国人你要自信,00:04:56.520,00:04:58.120,"China, be confident."
00:04:59.560,00:05:03.040,这就是中国请张维为说,00:04:59.660,00:05:02.840,China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:05:54.440,00:05:55.440,那么,,,
00:05:55.480,00:05:56.440,14年的时候,,,
00:05:56.680,00:05:58.360,我有一个演讲,00:05:54.680,00:05:58.900,"I gave a speech in 2014 titled ""The Chinese, You Need to Be Confident""."
00:05:58.840,00:06:00.560,那么当时也被关视频,,,
00:06:01.240,00:06:03.160,做了一个视频,00:05:58.900,00:06:05.260,It was made into a video by Guan Video.
00:06:03.640,00:06:04.600,标题叫中国人,,,
00:06:04.600,00:06:05.680,你要自信,,,
00:06:06.080,00:06:08.240,这个视频影响比较大,,,
00:06:08.240,00:06:09.120,传的比较广,00:06:06.140,00:06:11.380,The video probably gained over 100 million views online.
00:06:09.120,00:06:11.560,可能现在网上点击量数亿,,,
00:06:12.320,00:06:13.840,我当时我讲了一个故事,,,
00:06:13.840,00:06:15.000,我说有一次,,,
00:06:15.080,00:06:16.720,我在上海一个大学里,00:06:12.380,00:06:18.780,"In the video, I told a story about giving a lecture
about China's Rise at a university in Shanghai."
00:06:17.720,00:06:19.200,讲中国崛起,,,
00:06:19.320,00:06:20.920,然后有个,,,
00:06:20.960,00:06:22.600,青年教师就提这个问题,00:06:19.440,00:06:22.520,"In the Q&A segment, a young scholar asked me,"
00:06:22.600,00:06:24.800,他说张老师你的演讲,,,
00:06:24.800,00:06:26.160,给人一种感觉,00:06:23.080,00:06:28.120,"""Professor Zhang, you speech made me feel
the Chinese people are very happy about their lives."""
00:06:26.280,00:06:28.480,好像中国人都生活特别幸福,,,
00:06:28.800,00:06:29.760,但是现在有,,,
00:06:29.800,00:06:30.200,这么多,00:06:28.880,00:06:31.500,"""But there are so many people who want to emigrant."""
00:06:30.240,00:06:31.280,要求移民,,,
00:06:31.920,00:06:32.720,你能不能劝他们,,,
00:06:32.720,00:06:34.520,不要移民留在中国,00:06:31.840,00:06:34.360,"""Can you tell them to stay?"""
00:06:35.040,00:06:37.320,那么我说你这个问题真是问对人,00:06:35.200,00:06:37.400,"I said, ""You're asking the right person."""
00:06:37.320,00:06:38.160,因为我说我认识的,,,
00:06:38.160,00:06:40.880,海外华人移民太多了,00:06:37.420,00:06:40.160,"""I know so many Chinese expats."""
00:06:41.160,00:06:43.600,我说我不做这样的傻事情,00:06:41.440,00:06:45.500,"""It would be silly to tell them to stay.
I'd encourage them to go."""
00:06:43.760,00:06:45.240,我是鼓励他们移民,,,
00:06:45.920,00:06:48.680,那么我说我做过一个小小的研究,,,
00:06:48.720,00:06:50.520,就是中国人出国之后,00:06:46.500,00:06:52.320,"""I did a study which found Chinese people
to love China more after they went abroad."""
00:06:50.600,00:06:52.520,我叫做一出国就爱国,,,
00:06:52.840,00:06:53.480,真的,,,
00:06:53.480,00:06:54.760,我刚才讲了一句,00:06:52.800,00:06:56.280,"""It's true. It's better than the Party's education."""
00:06:54.760,00:06:55.160,小口,,,
00:06:55.160,00:06:56.680,比党的教育还要好,,,
00:06:57.680,00:06:58.520,我还跟他说了一个,,,
00:06:58.840,00:07:00.960,我说大约我自己的估计,00:06:57.340,00:07:02.500,"""I have a conservative estimate that"""
00:07:02.560,00:07:03.760,最保守的估计,,,
00:07:03.760,00:07:05.560,70%以上的人,00:07:02.700,00:07:07.400,"""over 70% loved China more after they went abroad."""
00:07:05.920,00:07:07.560,出国之后变得更加爱国,,,
00:07:08.400,00:07:10.720,我说如果你想移民纽约,00:07:08.440,00:07:12.100,"""I have a tip for you if you'd like to move to New York."""
00:07:10.720,00:07:12.120,我说我给你支个招,,,
00:07:12.160,00:07:13.600,我说我这纽约比较熟悉,00:07:12.320,00:07:14.820,"""I'm probably as familiar with New York as with Shanghai."""
00:07:13.600,00:07:14.880,可能不亚于上海,,,
00:07:15.560,00:07:17.960,我说你可以从上海的浦东机场,,,
00:07:18.000,00:07:19.600,或者虹桥机场出发,00:07:15.700,00:07:23.480,"""You can fly from Shanghai Pudong Airport or
Hongqiao Airport to any airport in New York."""
00:07:20.320,00:07:21.640,然后将到纽约,,,
00:07:21.640,00:07:22.520,任何一个机场,,,
00:07:22.520,00:07:23.840,纽约三个机场,,,
00:07:24.200,00:07:25.880,你们现在跟上海联系比较多的,00:07:24.040,00:07:26.880,"""Now most flights go to Newark Airport."""
00:07:25.880,00:07:27.320,是纽瓦克机场,,,
00:07:27.520,00:07:29.280,我说你先感受一下,,,
00:07:29.280,00:07:29.960,什么叫做,,,
00:07:29.960,00:07:32.120,从第一世界的机场,00:07:27.680,00:07:33.120,"""You will experience flying from a
first-world airport to a third-world airport."""
00:07:32.240,00:07:34.000,到第三世界的机场,,,
00:07:34.440,00:07:36.160,因为美国的基础设施,,,
00:07:36.360,00:07:38.560,大部分都是五六十年代建的,00:07:34.520,00:07:38.420,"Most of the America's infrastructure
was built in the 1950s and 1960s."
00:07:38.800,00:07:39.840,这不跟中国,00:07:38.720,00:07:40.100,It can't compare with China's.
00:07:40.680,00:07:41.960,我要跟他开了个玩笑,,,
00:07:42.000,00:07:43.760,说是你尝试一下,00:07:40.820,00:07:45.660,I also jokingly asked him to stay in Newark for a night.
00:07:43.960,00:07:46.040,在纽瓦克镇注意,,,
00:07:46.560,00:07:48.200,我住过,00:07:46.680,00:07:48.120,I did that myself.
00:07:48.400,00:07:49.000,你试试看,,,
00:07:49.000,00:07:50.680,你晚上敢不敢出去,00:07:48.160,00:07:51.000,"""See if you are brave enough to go out at night."""
00:07:51.880,00:07:52.880,我有个朋友,,,
00:07:52.920,00:07:55.600,在纽瓦克医学院做过博士后,00:07:51.800,00:07:55.280,"I have a friend who worked as a postdoc
at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School."
00:07:55.880,00:07:56.320,我当时讲,,,
00:07:56.360,00:07:57.080,我说我问过他,00:07:56.000,00:07:57.280,"I asked him, ""What's the best department of your school?"""
00:07:57.200,00:07:57.680,的,,,
00:07:57.720,00:07:59.320,你这一学院哪个专业最好,,,
00:07:59.880,00:08:00.400,他说讲,00:07:57.480,00:08:02.940,"He said, ""I don't mean to scare you,
but it's the trauma care department."""
00:08:00.400,00:08:01.960,你不要害怕枪伤,,,
00:08:02.000,00:08:03.080,隔了,,,
00:08:03.520,00:08:04.160,对,,,
00:08:04.280,00:08:05.080,所以我就说了,,,
00:08:05.080,00:08:06.480,你对美国这个国家,,,
00:08:06.480,00:08:09.360,有点常识性的了解,00:08:04.080,00:08:09.440,"If you have some basic knowledge of America,"
00:08:09.360,00:08:10.240,知道这个国家,,,
00:08:10.240,00:08:11.200,是第三世界,,,
00:08:11.200,00:08:12.800,第二世界第一世界,00:08:09.920,00:08:13.520,"you will know that this country is made up of
the third world, the second world, and the first world."
00:08:12.880,00:08:13.720,组成,,,
00:08:13.920,00:08:16.000,如果你不幸坠入美国第三世界,00:08:14.080,00:08:16.260,"If you unfortunately fall into America's third world,"
00:08:16.000,00:08:16.800,对不起,,,
00:08:16.920,00:08:18.800,你的命运可能非常凄惨,00:08:16.260,00:08:18.700,"sorry, your life is likely to be miserable."
00:08:19.680,00:08:21.320,那么如果你像我们很多留学生,,,
00:08:21.320,00:08:21.800,那样,,,
00:08:21.800,00:08:23.200,通过自己的努力,00:08:19.720,00:08:26.160,"If you work hard like many Chinese students abroad
and enter the second world or the middle class,"
00:08:23.240,00:08:24.120,进入美国,,,
00:08:24.120,00:08:25.200,所谓的第二世界,,,
00:08:25.200,00:08:26.760,成为一个中产阶级,,,
00:08:26.840,00:08:29.040,你问问他们过去20多年,00:08:26.720,00:08:31.340,"you can ask whether their real wages
have increased in the past two decades,"
00:08:29.160,00:08:31.320,你的实际收入有没有增加,,,
00:08:31.520,00:08:32.360,你买了房子,,,
00:08:32.400,00:08:33.880,你的房子有没有增值,00:08:31.660,00:08:34.220,"whether their house has appreciated if they purchased one,"
00:08:33.880,00:08:35.760,你的未来在美国的,,,
00:08:35.880,00:08:38.000,退休生活有没有信心,00:08:34.220,00:08:37.780,and whether they are confident about retirement in America.
00:08:38.280,00:08:40.280,我不是说美国什么都不好,00:08:38.180,00:08:40.180,I'm not saying everything in America is not good.
00:08:40.280,00:08:41.880,美国有些方面是不错的,00:08:40.180,00:08:42.240,Many things in America are good.
00:08:42.400,00:08:44.120,但现在一些工资,,,
00:08:44.120,00:08:47.160,还在虚构一个无比美好的彼岸,00:08:42.420,00:08:47.860,"But many public intellectuals are still fabricating
""America: a perfect world on the other shore""."
00:08:47.160,00:08:47.600,世界,,,
00:08:47.600,00:08:50.680,美国我叫令人笑掉大牙的,00:08:48.580,00:08:50.900,"That makes me ""laugh my teeth off""."
00:08:51.040,00:08:53.240,我今天让我再做一个,00:08:51.260,00:08:54.035,"If I were asked to make a speech on this topic today,"
00:08:53.240,00:08:54.840,类似主题的演讲的话,,,
00:08:55.040,00:08:56.160,我可能说,00:08:54.035,00:08:57.055,"I would say ""Go abroad and love China More""."
00:08:56.200,00:08:58.320,一出国就爱国比例,,,
00:08:58.320,00:09:01.600,应该比2014年更高了,00:08:57.060,00:09:01.260,"I estimated at least 80% of the Chinese
people abroad feel this way today,"
00:09:01.600,00:09:04.640,我估计是至少80%以上的人,00:09:01.260,00:09:04.100,an even larger proportion than in 2014.
00:09:05.000,00:09:06.040,那么一个重要原因,,,
00:09:06.080,00:09:09.200,是我们的90后95后,00:09:04.740,00:09:11.200,"A major reason is that the post-90s and post-95s
have joined the wave of going out."
00:09:09.400,00:09:12.120,加入了出国看一看的大潮,,,
00:09:12.680,00:09:14.240,那么90 95后,,,
00:09:14.400,00:09:15.680,从我们大数据来看,00:09:12.480,00:09:17.560,"Big data tells us that  the post-90s and post-95s
are probably the most confident generation in China."
00:09:15.800,00:09:17.840,是中国最自信的一代人,,,
00:09:18.480,00:09:19.240,他们,,,
00:09:19.280,00:09:21.000,没有经历过中国的贫困,00:09:18.520,00:09:22.500,They have no memory of China's poverty.
00:09:21.040,00:09:21.680,贫穷,,,
00:09:21.720,00:09:22.960,没有记忆,,,
00:09:23.240,00:09:24.760,他们是手机的一代,00:09:23.300,00:09:26.075,They are also a generation on mobile phones.
00:09:26.520,00:09:27.160,1出去,,,
00:09:27.160,00:09:28.960,无论到世界哪个国家,00:09:26.420,00:09:29.020,"Wherever they go to in the world,"
00:09:29.920,00:09:30.520,才知道,,,
00:09:30.520,00:09:31.520,就中国世界上,,,
00:09:31.520,00:09:32.240,唯一的一个,00:09:29.980,00:09:34.320,they will find out China is the only country where everything can be done on a [smart] phone.
00:09:32.240,00:09:33.240,就是一部手机,,,
00:09:33.240,00:09:34.920,全部搞定了国家,,,
00:09:35.440,00:09:36.160,那么,,,
00:09:36.200,00:09:37.000,我记得,,,
00:09:37.040,00:09:37.440,是,,,
00:09:37.920,00:09:39.080,大概是4年前,00:09:35.400,00:09:42.980,"I remember giving a speech for
an institute in Shanghai about 4 years ago."
00:09:40.320,00:09:41.520,上海一个机构,,,
00:09:41.520,00:09:43.520,请我去做一个讲座,,,
00:09:43.720,00:09:44.960,他们正在做一个,,,
00:09:44.960,00:09:46.440,上海国际大都市,00:09:43.480,00:09:48.420,"They were developing a long-term plan for the cultural
construction of Shanghai as an international metropolis."
00:09:46.440,00:09:47.600,文化建设的,,,
00:09:47.600,00:09:48.640,一个中期规划,,,
00:09:48.680,00:09:49.880,想听听我的意见,,,
00:09:49.880,00:09:52.320,你听说我走过100多个国家,00:09:48.420,00:09:52.340,"They wanted my input because they heard
that I had been to over 100 countries."
00:09:53.040,00:09:54.040,我说可以,,,
00:09:54.120,00:09:55.160,我非常乐意,,,
00:09:55.160,00:09:55.560,到时候,00:09:52.860,00:09:57.660,"I was happy to attend and asked them
to show me some previous studies."
00:09:55.560,00:09:56.600,你给我看一下,,,
00:09:56.600,00:09:58.000,别人做的研究,,,
00:09:58.400,00:10:00.840,我就看了两个研究报告,00:09:58.260,00:10:01.005,They provided me two reports.
00:10:00.840,00:10:01.600,那么实际上,,,
00:10:01.640,00:10:02.720,他们基本上,00:10:01.005,00:10:03.605,"Long story short,"
00:10:02.760,00:10:04.080,我把长话短说,,,
00:10:04.440,00:10:05.400,你看上海,,,
00:10:05.480,00:10:07.760,跟纽约差距在哪里,00:10:03.605,00:10:07.780,"they reports found Shanghai was behind New York in what,"
00:10:07.760,00:10:09.680,哪里跟巴黎差距在哪里,00:10:08.100,00:10:09.800,"behind Paris in what,"
00:10:09.680,00:10:11.560,哪里跟着伦敦差距在哪里,00:10:09.800,00:10:11.620,and behind London in what.
00:10:12.360,00:10:15.320,我说我在这三个城市我都住过,00:10:11.960,00:10:15.540,"I told them, ""I have lived in these three cities myself,
and I don't feel that is exactly the case."""
00:10:16.160,00:10:17.960,我感觉好像不完全是这样的,,,
00:10:17.960,00:10:20.480,实际上有些地方在上海,00:10:16.120,00:10:22.720,"""In some areas, Shanghai has been doing better or much better."""
00:10:20.480,00:10:21.640,已经比人家做得好,,,
00:10:21.640,00:10:23.000,甚至好很多了,,,
00:10:23.160,00:10:25.560,你比方说以硬件为例,,,
00:10:25.560,00:10:27.440,应该说上海的硬件方面,00:10:23.160,00:10:30.440,"In terms of infrastructure, Shanghai is
leading the other three cities overall."
00:10:27.480,00:10:31.160,全面领先这几个世界大城市,,,
00:10:31.560,00:10:33.360,那么肯定是超过纽约了,00:10:31.460,00:10:33.720,It has surely surpassed New York.
00:10:33.480,00:10:34.520,那么跟轮,,,
00:10:34.560,00:10:36.280,墩巴黎也是可以比一比,00:10:33.720,00:10:37.940,It's comparable to and even better than London and Paris.
00:10:36.280,00:10:38.160,甚至很多地方比他们好了,,,
00:10:38.440,00:10:39.240,那么人,,,
00:10:39.280,00:10:40.320,然后我说你还可以比较,,,
00:10:40.360,00:10:42.560,比方说是家庭中位净资产,00:10:38.340,00:10:42.400,We can also compare median household net worth.
00:10:42.760,00:10:44.080,我们现在有数据的,00:10:42.720,00:10:44.400,We have the data.
00:10:44.360,00:10:45.880,人均预期寿命,00:10:44.400,00:10:47.300,"And average life expectancy, infant mortality rate, and so on."
00:10:46.080,00:10:47.440,婴儿死亡率,,,
00:10:47.480,00:10:48.240,等等,,,
00:10:48.240,00:10:49.720,明显的高于纽约了,00:10:48.155,00:10:49.955,We noticeably outperform New York.
00:10:51.080,00:10:51.520,伦敦,,,
00:10:51.520,00:10:52.840,巴黎也可以异地,00:10:50.380,00:10:52.880,And we can compare the same statistics with London and Paris.
00:10:53.520,00:10:54.280,那么社会治安,,,
00:10:54.320,00:10:55.480,比这三个城市都好,00:10:53.340,00:10:56.720,"Shanghai's social security is better
or much better than the three cities."
00:10:55.480,00:10:56.800,甚至好很多,,,
00:10:57.080,00:10:58.520,我觉得这些东西,,,
00:10:58.560,00:11:00.200,是一个基础性的东西,00:10:57.200,00:11:01.640,These are the important benchmarks.
00:11:00.200,00:11:02.120,我觉得非常重要,,,
00:11:02.440,00:11:03.840,然后我就提了个建议,,,
00:11:03.880,00:11:05.120,为上海这样城市,,,
00:11:05.120,00:11:08.040,乃至为任何一个地方做规划,00:11:02.560,00:11:07.720,"I also suggested that when they plan for Shanghai or any city,"
00:11:08.200,00:11:09.240,你首先要考虑,,,
00:11:09.240,00:11:11.640,这个地方人民本身的,00:11:07.900,00:11:13.220,they should consider how the local people feel in general.
00:11:12.560,00:11:14.080,整个的感觉对不对,00:11:13.520,00:11:14.440,Right?
00:11:14.080,00:11:16.240,它的文化偏好特别重要,00:11:14.440,00:11:16.140,Especially their cultural preferences.
00:11:16.640,00:11:19.400,我想强调用中国人的视角,00:11:16.420,00:11:22.100,"If we look at the world through the perspectives and
the cultural preferences of the Chinese people,"
00:11:19.400,00:11:21.240,中国的文化偏好,,,
00:11:21.440,00:11:22.680,来看这个世界,,,
00:11:22.720,00:11:24.560,这个时候我们再来做个比较,,,
00:11:24.560,00:11:27.280,包括和纽约和伦敦和巴黎进行,00:11:22.460,00:11:27.500,"and compare with New York, London, and Paris,"
00:11:27.280,00:11:28.040,比较,,,
00:11:28.160,00:11:29.480,然后我们可以更好的,00:11:27.860,00:11:30.820,it will allow us to make better plans.
00:11:29.480,00:11:30.720,做这么一个规划,,,
00:11:30.920,00:11:32.320,我说你看你们这个城市,,,
00:11:32.320,00:11:32.800,比较中,,,
00:11:32.800,00:11:34.000,有一个指标,,,
00:11:34.000,00:11:35.720,叫做就一个城市里边,00:11:31.100,00:11:37.160,"One indicator they considered was the
number of restaurant per capita of a city,"
00:11:35.720,00:11:37.480,人均餐厅的数目,,,
00:11:37.880,00:11:39.720,比方说你这个城市多少人口,,,
00:11:39.760,00:11:40.240,偶,,,
00:11:40.280,00:11:42.400,多少餐馆来除一除得出,00:11:37.960,00:11:43.160,which is the population divided by the number of restaurants.
00:11:42.720,00:11:45.400,那么这比例高的就越高,00:11:43.540,00:11:46.260,A higher value is more desirable.
00:11:45.400,00:11:46.640,好就越好,,,
00:11:46.800,00:11:48.920,所以我说你那里面加一个纬度,,,
00:11:48.920,00:11:51.080,就是餐馆的种类,00:11:46.800,00:11:52.660,"I suggested that they can also consider the
variety of restaurants as another dimension."
00:11:51.280,00:11:52.840,各种不同的餐饮,,,
00:11:53.600,00:11:55.600,这一家中国就明显的好多了,00:11:53.340,00:11:55.860,China would score much better with that considered.
00:11:55.640,00:11:57.240,关键是中国人的文化偏好,,,
00:11:57.240,00:11:57.720,对不对,,,
00:11:57.760,00:11:58.680,他希望,00:11:55.860,00:12:01.340,"This is one of our cultural preference.
We would often like to eat something different."
00:11:59.600,00:12:01.680,经常尝尝鲜不同的菜系,,,
00:12:02.000,00:12:02.960,中国人,,,
00:12:03.000,00:12:03.120,他,00:12:02.060,00:12:04.220,"[hot pot]
""The food can never be too finely prepared."""
00:12:04.240,00:12:05.000,吃喜欢,00:12:04.220,00:12:05.380,[noodles]
00:12:05.040,00:12:06.200,食不厌精,,,
00:12:06.240,00:12:07.760,他要多样性,00:12:05.380,00:12:07.720,"[roasted duck]
We prefer the diversity in food."
00:12:07.880,00:12:09.560,不能老是吃热狗,00:12:08.020,00:12:10.240,We can't eat hot dogs and burgers all the time.
00:12:09.560,00:12:10.040,汉堡包,,,
00:12:10.040,00:12:11.120,麦当劳对不对,,,
00:12:11.120,00:12:12.720,一两天他就吃不下去了,00:12:10.240,00:12:12.660,"[shumai]
We'd be tired of that after a day or two."
00:12:13.400,00:12:14.640,一出国就爱国,00:12:13.060,00:12:15.380,"We ""go abroad and love China more"""
00:12:15.400,00:12:17.120,实际上很大程度上,,,
00:12:17.120,00:12:19.240,是中国人的味蕾,00:12:15.380,00:12:20.340,firstly because of our taste buds.
00:12:19.840,00:12:21.040,太发达了,,,
00:12:21.040,00:12:21.520,真的,,,
00:12:21.520,00:12:23.040,你一到西方国家,,,
00:12:23.080,00:12:23.880,或者其他国家,00:12:21.600,00:12:25.780,This is really how you would feel when visit another country.
00:12:23.880,00:12:25.320,你真的是这个感觉,,,
00:12:26.120,00:12:27.080,这个东西落后我们,,,
00:12:27.120,00:12:28.000,一千年都不,00:12:26.320,00:12:28.620,"""The food here is 1000 years behind China."""
00:12:28.240,00:12:29.000,你,,,
00:12:29.400,00:12:30.000,了,,,
00:12:30.080,00:12:31.520,你看我们的留学生,,,
00:12:31.520,00:12:32.680,也是在国内时候,00:12:30.260,00:12:33.620,"The university students would always
complain about their canteens at school."
00:12:32.680,00:12:35.120,抱怨大学食堂不好,00:12:33.620,00:12:36.060,They would be picky about this and that.
00:12:35.120,00:12:36.160,很挑剔,,,
00:12:36.320,00:12:38.000,但到国外他就开始怀念了,00:12:36.260,00:12:38.440,And they become nostalgic when they go abroad.
00:12:38.000,00:12:39.640,什么时候才有这么好的食堂,,,
00:12:39.640,00:12:41.080,这么多的选择,00:12:38.445,00:12:40.985,"""When could have the variety of food back home?"""
00:12:41.280,00:12:42.520,所以我觉得,,,
00:12:42.880,00:12:44.160,中国它是一个,00:12:41.240,00:12:47.040,"China is a civilized state that is ""a whole a hundred nations""."
00:12:45.440,00:12:46.880,文明型国家,,,
00:12:47.000,00:12:48.560,我叫做百国之合,,,
00:12:48.560,00:12:49.760,成百上千国家,00:12:47.080,00:12:51.360,A slow integration of hundreds of nations.
00:12:49.760,00:12:51.080,慢慢整合起来,,,
00:12:51.280,00:12:52.760,他餐饮之丰富,,,
00:12:52.760,00:12:54.480,一般国家确实很难比的,00:12:51.360,00:12:54.720,Other countries can hardly compare to China in the richness of food.
00:12:54.600,00:12:56.320,我老说欧洲最好的菜系,00:12:54.720,00:12:57.680,I believe French cuisines are the best in Europe.
00:12:56.360,00:12:57.600,是法国菜系,,,
00:12:58.040,00:13:00.120,但是你拿出中国八大菜系中,00:12:57.820,00:13:01.280,But any of our eight regional cuisines
00:13:00.160,00:13:01.080,任何一个,,,
00:13:01.880,00:13:03.440,是广度,00:13:01.620,00:13:04.880,"surpass French cuisines in width and depth,"
00:13:03.440,00:13:04.160,深度,,,
00:13:04.200,00:13:05.480,都是超过法国的爱,,,
00:13:05.480,00:13:06.480,他都丰富,,,
00:13:06.480,00:13:08.080,多样性都是超过他的,00:13:05.600,00:13:07.860,and richness and variety.
00:13:08.120,00:13:09.160,因为法国菜,,,
00:13:09.160,00:13:11.480,它是法法兰西一个民族的才,00:13:08.160,00:13:11.180,French cuisines only belong to the French nation
00:13:11.480,00:13:12.480,我是很多,,,
00:13:12.480,00:13:13.560,我叫百国之合,00:13:11.360,00:13:14.600,while ours were formed by hundreds of nations.
00:13:13.560,00:13:15.240,形成的这样的菜系,,,
00:13:15.640,00:13:17.640,另外还有一个情况,,,
00:13:17.640,00:13:20.000,我说你也可以把加到指数里面去,00:13:15.800,00:13:21.660,Another indicator I suggested they can consider is
00:13:20.000,00:13:22.080,或者比较的参考系里面,,,
00:13:22.840,00:13:24.480,我们亲朋好友相聚,,,
00:13:24.520,00:13:26.400,一般都喜欢在餐馆要个单间,00:13:22.500,00:13:26.660,"the Chinese people prefer to have a private room when
they dine with family or friends in the restaurants."
00:13:26.440,00:13:28.520,但国外的餐馆,,,
00:13:28.520,00:13:30.280,特别是美国和欧洲的餐馆,00:13:27.420,00:13:31.260,"For restaurants abroad, especially in the West,"
00:13:30.320,00:13:31.280,你知道,,,
00:13:31.800,00:13:33.680,这个单间是非常奢侈,00:13:31.480,00:13:33.680,private rooms are a luxury.
00:13:33.880,00:13:35.240,可以说99%的餐馆,00:13:33.900,00:13:36.200,Probably 99% of the restaurants don't have any.
00:13:35.240,00:13:36.120,是没有单间的,,,
00:13:37.000,00:13:38.600,一般都在大堂里吃饭,00:13:37.020,00:13:38.680,People normally eat in the hall.
00:13:38.800,00:13:40.520,我说你这个餐馆比较的时候,00:13:38.900,00:13:41.700,So we can add our cultural preference to the comparative study
00:13:40.520,00:13:42.160,你加一个文化偏好,,,
00:13:42.160,00:13:42.520,就是,,,
00:13:43.680,00:13:44.520,餐馆里边,00:13:41.700,00:13:46.060,and consider the proportion of restaurants offering private rooms.
00:13:44.520,00:13:46.440,有单间的餐馆的比例,,,
00:13:46.720,00:13:48.160,你在进行国际比较时,00:13:46.700,00:13:48.380,"For a comparison between countries,"
00:13:48.160,00:13:49.760,不能光是用西方的标准,00:13:48.380,00:13:50.020,we should not only use western standards.
00:13:49.800,00:13:51.680,你不要融入中国的元素,00:13:50.020,00:13:53.140,We must blend in Chinese elements.
00:13:51.840,00:13:52.280,中国,,,
00:13:53.000,00:13:54.480,从富起来到强起来,00:13:53.140,00:13:54.920,"""From getting rich to getting strong."""
00:13:54.480,00:13:55.680,一个重要的强劫,,,
00:13:55.680,00:13:58.840,就是用中国人的眼光标准,00:13:54.920,00:13:59.600,We are strong when we look at the world through the Chinese eye.
00:13:58.880,00:13:59.720,来看这个世界,,,
00:13:59.720,00:14:01.600,你能不能做到我这个水平,00:13:59.900,00:14:02.100,Can you meet our standards?
00:14:02.120,00:14:04.280,所以我觉得这只是举一个例子,00:14:02.240,00:14:05.000,That's just an example.
00:14:04.520,00:14:06.840,这个例子可以投射到其他方面来,00:14:05.000,00:14:07.840,It can be projected to other aspects of life.
00:14:06.840,00:14:07.880,举一反三,,,
00:14:08.440,00:14:09.680,另外我觉得很重要,,,
00:14:09.680,00:14:11.080,就是家庭文化,00:14:08.460,00:14:10.940,The second cultural preference is the family culture.
00:14:11.080,00:14:13.600,实际上中国人为家庭所做的,,,
00:14:14.600,00:14:15.840,付出牺牲,00:14:11.100,00:14:18.560,"The Chinese people make far more sacrifices
to their family than the average westerners."
00:14:15.840,00:14:18.080,远远超过西方一般的家庭,,,
00:14:18.080,00:14:18.960,一般的人,,,
00:14:19.400,00:14:21.240,那么我几年前参加过一个,,,
00:14:22.040,00:14:23.360,文化,00:14:19.520,00:14:25.060,"In a discussion held by the Ministry of Culture,"
00:14:23.400,00:14:25.080,部组织的一个研讨会,,,
00:14:25.120,00:14:25.920,内部的,,,
00:14:25.920,00:14:28.160,他讨论去中国电影如何走出去,00:14:25.280,00:14:28.000,"an internal meeting about ""Chinese movies going out""."
00:14:28.640,00:14:29.440,我记得当时有个,,,
00:14:29.440,00:14:31.520,从事电影国际传播的官员说,00:14:28.640,00:14:31.700,An official in the international promotions of Chinese movies said
00:14:31.520,00:14:32.800,中国电影走不出去,00:14:31.700,00:14:33.100,our movies had a hard time going out.
00:14:32.800,00:14:33.720,为什么,00:14:33.100,00:14:33.940,Why?
00:14:33.960,00:14:35.560,因为老外想看电影,,,
00:14:35.560,00:14:37.000,中国电影就是功夫片,00:14:33.940,00:14:38.300,Because we only had Kungfu movies.
00:14:37.000,00:14:37.800,武打片,,,
00:14:37.840,00:14:39.480,其他好像没有什么,,,
00:14:39.480,00:14:40.440,他没兴趣,00:14:38.420,00:14:40.760,It seemed the foreign audience was not interested in anything else.
00:14:40.760,00:14:41.600,我说不可能,00:14:40.760,00:14:42.040,"I said, ""How's that possible?"""
00:14:41.960,00:14:43.560,我说我记得,00:14:42.040,00:14:44.875,"I remember watching a movie about 20 years ago in New York,"
00:14:43.560,00:14:45.000,大概二十来年前的时候,,,
00:14:45.000,00:14:47.800,我在纽约看过一个电影叫喜福会,00:14:44.880,00:14:48.380,"""The Joy Luck Club""."
00:14:48.880,00:14:50.000,讲的故事非常简单,,,
00:14:50.000,00:14:52.560,就是三个母亲跟她女儿,00:14:49.000,00:14:54.340,"It was a simple story about 3-4
[immigrant] mothers and their daughters."
00:14:52.560,00:14:54.920,讲自己年轻时候的故事,,,
00:14:55.680,00:14:56.560,那么,,,
00:14:56.600,00:14:58.080,几个女儿听得入神,,,
00:14:58.400,00:15:00.280,然后每天就讲新的故事,00:14:55.520,00:15:02.620,"The movie was developed based on
their past experiences and new life."
00:15:00.320,00:15:00.880,电影就这样,,,
00:15:00.880,00:15:02.840,把整个故事展开了,,,
00:15:03.400,00:15:04.080,我当时说,,,
00:15:04.080,00:15:05.440,我边上有个美国老太太,00:15:03.400,00:15:06.820,An elderly American lady was sitting next to me in the theater.
00:15:05.480,00:15:06.800,一边看一边流泪,,,
00:15:07.160,00:15:08.400,他说这种场景,00:15:07.320,00:15:09.140,She cried when she was watching the movie.
00:15:08.400,00:15:10.000,我们最近见不到了,,,
00:15:10.040,00:15:11.160,五十年代的时候,00:15:09.140,00:15:12.900,"She told me it was like her memories of the 50s
and people were not like that any more."
00:15:11.160,00:15:12.680,可能还有现在没有,,,
00:15:13.640,00:15:14.560,那么,,,
00:15:15.080,00:15:15.640,背后就是,,,
00:15:15.680,00:15:16.000,是,,,
00:15:16.560,00:15:17.760,很多西方国家,00:15:13.700,00:15:20.660,"Behind the movie was the ongoing disintegration of the
many western societies, especially the American society."
00:15:17.760,00:15:18.600,西方社会,,,
00:15:18.600,00:15:20.520,特别像美国这样的社会,,,
00:15:20.720,00:15:23.040,你仔细看他社会结构,00:15:20.660,00:15:25.180,"If we look at its social structure from a Chinese perspective,"
00:15:23.480,00:15:24.040,我还是强调,,,
00:15:24.040,00:15:25.640,用中国人的标准来看,,,
00:15:25.880,00:15:27.040,它的结构是一种,,,
00:15:27.040,00:15:27.640,或多或少,00:15:25.960,00:15:28.720,it is more of less fragmenting.
00:15:27.640,00:15:29.240,处于解体的结构,,,
00:15:29.640,00:15:30.840,你比方我看的资料,,,
00:15:30.840,00:15:32.200,是2014年,00:15:29.760,00:15:32.440,"For example, I found 2014 data that"
00:15:32.760,00:15:33.920,传统家庭,,,
00:15:33.920,00:15:36.480,在美国所有家庭结构中,00:15:32.540,00:15:37.740,"traditional families accounted for only
19% of the American population."
00:15:36.520,00:15:37.960,占19%,,,
00:15:38.360,00:15:39.920,也就是说父母家孩子,,,
00:15:39.920,00:15:41.280,典型的传统家庭,00:15:38.340,00:15:42.960,"Traditional families as in ""parents + children""
and they only accounted for 19%."
00:15:41.280,00:15:42.760,只占到19%,,,
00:15:43.040,00:15:45.240,其他的都是非传统家庭,00:15:43.200,00:15:46.915,The others were non-traditional families
00:15:45.320,00:15:45.840,这包括,,,
00:15:47.200,00:15:47.680,不结婚,,,
00:15:47.680,00:15:48.680,同居的,,,
00:15:48.920,00:15:50.280,没有孩子的,00:15:46.920,00:15:51.440,"including cohabitation of unmarried couples, childless couples, and LGBT."
00:15:50.360,00:15:51.480,同性恋的,,,
00:15:51.840,00:15:53.520,还有一个很大不小的比例,,,
00:15:53.520,00:15:56.360,就大孩子生小孩子不知道父亲是,00:15:52.060,00:15:55.080,"And a not small proportion of ""big children having kids"""
00:15:56.360,00:15:57.000,谁的,00:15:55.140,00:15:57.240,with the father unknown.
00:15:57.560,00:15:58.280,那么,,,
00:15:58.320,00:15:59.720,有的研究已经证明,,,
00:16:00.200,00:16:01.280,后边这一类,00:15:57.540,00:16:03.960,"Some studies found the crime rates are
linked to such families with absent fathers."
00:16:01.400,00:16:03.560,美国的犯罪比例比较高,,,
00:16:03.560,00:16:04.280,有关系,,,
00:16:04.640,00:16:05.000,所以说,,,
00:16:05.000,00:16:08.520,就把中国人普通的家庭生活,,,
00:16:08.520,00:16:09.320,这种,,,
00:16:09.720,00:16:10.920,家庭亲情,00:16:04.520,00:16:14.900,"A movie about ordinary Chinese family life and
family bonds can reach the hearts of many foreigners."
00:16:11.360,00:16:12.080,拍成电影,,,
00:16:12.120,00:16:15.160,可以打动很多外国人,,,
00:16:15.960,00:16:16.640,那么第三,,,
00:16:16.760,00:16:18.080,我叫做市井文化,00:16:15.760,00:16:18.460,The third is the neighborhood culture.
00:16:18.080,00:16:20.200,就普通老百姓日常的生活,00:16:18.460,00:16:20.560,It's our everyday life.
00:16:20.240,00:16:21.680,大家有没有注意,,,
00:16:21.680,00:16:23.160,习主席主政以后,00:16:20.560,00:16:25.140,"Did anyone notice the first thing President Xi said
to the press after his inauguration was"
00:16:23.160,00:16:24.360,第一次见记者,,,
00:16:24.360,00:16:26.880,第一句话就是中国人民热爱生活,00:16:25.140,00:16:28.080,"""The Chinese people have so much love for life""?"
00:16:28.080,00:16:29.560,人民对美好生活的追求,,,
00:16:29.600,00:16:30.920,是我们奋斗的目标,00:16:28.200,00:16:31.520,"""The people's pursuit of a better life is our quest."""
00:16:32.160,00:16:32.960,那么实际上,,,
00:16:33.000,00:16:34.160,中国普通老百姓,,,
00:16:34.200,00:16:35.800,把每天的生活,00:16:32.220,00:16:37.980,"We have so much enjoyment in our
everyday life and value that a lot."
00:16:35.920,00:16:37.080,他过得有滋有味,,,
00:16:37.080,00:16:38.080,她看得很重,,,
00:16:38.720,00:16:40.320,你在上海叫弄堂文化,00:16:38.700,00:16:40.700,"The nongtangs [alleyways] in Shanghai,"
00:16:40.320,00:16:41.560,北京叫胡同文化,00:16:40.700,00:16:41.980,or the hutongs [alleyways] in Beijing.
00:16:41.560,00:16:42.200,下棋的,,,
00:16:42.240,00:16:43.960,大牌的泡茶的,00:16:41.980,00:16:44.240,"People playing chess or cards, having tea,"
00:16:44.000,00:16:45.960,练太极拳的早锻炼,00:16:44.240,00:16:46.160,"doing tai chi or other morning exercises,"
00:16:45.960,00:16:48.000,晚上跳广场舞的等等,00:16:46.200,00:16:48.300,"square dancing in the evenings, and so on."
00:16:48.280,00:16:49.280,我看到多少老外,,,
00:16:49.280,00:16:50.280,看到中国广场舞,00:16:48.300,00:16:51.220,I see a lot of foreigners getting excited about square dance in China.
00:16:50.280,00:16:51.240,特别激动,,,
00:16:52.000,00:16:54.000,那么我还想到就是商业文化,00:16:52.120,00:16:54.660,The fourth is the commerce culture.
00:16:54.040,00:16:57.160,就上海的商业的便利,,,
00:16:57.160,00:16:59.960,确实是世界上我认为是最发达的,00:16:55.040,00:16:59.620,"Shanghai, in my opinion, has the highest
commercial convenience in the world."
00:17:00.640,00:17:01.480,不行,,,
00:17:01.480,00:17:02.760,是去5分钟,00:17:00.680,00:17:04.360,There is a 24-hour store every 5 minutes of walk.
00:17:02.760,00:17:04.520,就有24小时便利店,,,
00:17:04.800,00:17:05.520,那么现在还有,,,
00:17:07.000,00:17:07.400,淘宝,,,
00:17:07.520,00:17:09.040,京东网购,00:17:04.900,00:17:08.680,We also have shopping websites such as Taobao and JD.
00:17:09.280,00:17:12.480,那么中国现在每天的快递包裹,00:17:09.300,00:17:15.400,"China's number of daily delivered parcels exceed
the total of the other major countries."
00:17:12.480,00:17:14.280,超过世界上其他主要国家,,,
00:17:14.440,00:17:15.880,快递包裹的总和,,,
00:17:16.320,00:17:19.520,可以说是线上线下的一场消费,00:17:16.480,00:17:19.940,This is a consumer revolution online and offline .
00:17:19.520,00:17:20.200,革命,,,
00:17:20.400,00:17:21.640,那么如果你们在欧洲,,,
00:17:21.640,00:17:22.560,在美国生活过,00:17:20.540,00:17:23.820,"If you have lived in Europe or America,
especially Europe,"
00:17:22.560,00:17:23.400,特别是欧洲,,,
00:17:23.640,00:17:24.800,它周末的商店,,,
00:17:24.800,00:17:26.200,营业时间要么减少,00:17:23.820,00:17:27.560,most stores either close or shorten their business hours on weekends.
00:17:26.240,00:17:26.960,要么是,,,
00:17:26.960,00:17:27.760,关了,,,
00:17:27.960,00:17:29.160,因为中国人不太习惯,,,
00:17:29.160,00:17:30.600,从中国文化偏好来说,00:17:27.980,00:17:30.800,We are not used to that as a cultural preference.
00:17:30.640,00:17:31.160,这个商店,,,
00:17:31.160,00:17:32.600,应该开到晚上9:00,00:17:30.800,00:17:34.040,We expect the stores to be open to 9pm or 10pm
00:17:32.600,00:17:32.960, 10:00,,,
00:17:33.120,00:17:34.400,不能这么早就关,00:17:34.360,00:17:35.880,and open on the weekends.
00:17:34.480,00:17:37.200,周末也应该开文化习惯的不同,00:17:35.880,00:17:37.500,This is a cultural difference.
00:17:37.680,00:17:38.520,那么,,,
00:17:38.560,00:17:40.840,快递网购邮购也是,00:17:37.620,00:17:41.000,Same with online shopping.
00:17:40.880,00:17:42.840,国内经常是论天称不得,00:17:41.120,00:17:44.120,"We usually expect to receive a parcel
on the same day or the next day."
00:17:42.880,00:17:43.760,今天到明天到,,,
00:17:43.800,00:17:44.360,对不对,,,
00:17:44.600,00:17:47.400,国外一般都是论周几个星期,00:17:44.660,00:17:48.195,But it usually takes one or more weeks abroad.
00:17:47.480,00:17:48.160,国内有时候,,,
00:17:48.200,00:17:51.480,对剁手党次论天论小时来计算,00:17:48.520,00:17:51.280,"Our ""hand choppers"" [online shopaholics] are even counting by hours."
00:17:52.320,00:17:53.160,那么另外,,,
00:17:53.840,00:17:54.880,跟网购有关,00:17:52.340,00:17:55.120,"Related to e-commerce,"
00:17:54.880,00:17:55.600,更重要的一个,,,
00:17:55.880,00:17:59.080,中国移动互联网方面的突飞猛进,00:17:55.120,00:17:58.980,the fifth culture preference is the advancement of mobile Internet.
00:17:59.360,00:18:01.480,那么一个手机全部搞定,00:17:59.260,00:18:01.940,Everything can be done on a [smart] phone.
00:18:01.480,00:18:02.520,我刚才说了,,,
00:18:02.680,00:18:03.880,订酒店机票,00:18:02.880,00:18:04.100,"Booking hotels and flights,"
00:18:03.920,00:18:04.400,要,,,
00:18:04.440,00:18:05.720,顶聊天,00:18:04.105,00:18:06.925,"chats and gaming,"
00:18:05.760,00:18:06.800,玩游戏,,,
00:18:06.800,00:18:07.360,公司,,,
00:18:07.360,00:18:08.800,业务付款都可以,00:18:06.925,00:18:09.460,"business payments,"
00:18:08.840,00:18:10.040,手机上全部解决,,,
00:18:10.040,00:18:11.080,非常方便,,,
00:18:11.320,00:18:12.240,让把这些功能,00:18:09.760,00:18:14.260,they are all conveniently integrated into WeChat.
00:18:12.240,00:18:14.840,全部整合到一个微信平台上,,,
00:18:14.840,00:18:16.200,确实现在其他国家,,,
00:18:16.200,00:18:17.480,没有一个国家做到,00:18:15.160,00:18:17.860,No other country has achieved this before.
00:18:18.040,00:18:19.480,那么我看这数据,,,
00:18:19.480,00:18:20.800,今天中国的手机支付,00:18:18.080,00:18:22.140,"I saw data showing that China's mobile payment
now is 70 times that of the United States."
00:18:20.800,00:18:22.600,已经是美国的70倍,,,
00:18:23.240,00:18:25.400,我觉得这90后一出国,,,
00:18:25.440,00:18:26.120,爱国,,,
00:18:26.440,00:18:27.400,比例更大,00:18:23.340,00:18:30.120,"Perhaps more post-90s than older generations love
China more when they are abroad because of the mobile culture."
00:18:27.520,00:18:28.720,恐怕和,,,
00:18:28.760,00:18:29.360,这个手机,,,
00:18:29.400,00:18:30.200,文化有关,,,
00:18:30.200,00:18:30.720,那么,,,
00:18:30.760,00:18:32.720,中国移动互联网的迅猛发展,00:18:30.320,00:18:34.200,The rapid growth of our mobile Internet results from the Chinese culture.
00:18:32.720,00:18:33.400,实际上和中国,,,
00:18:33.440,00:18:34.600,文化也是有关的,,,
00:18:34.640,00:18:35.800,这是很大一题目以后,,,
00:18:35.840,00:18:37.320,可以专门做一个讲座,00:18:34.620,00:18:37.680,"This is a really big topic.
I can dedicate a speech to it in the future."
00:18:37.560,00:18:38.800,我就简单说说,,,
00:18:38.840,00:18:41.560,恐怕一个是和中国人圈子文化,00:18:37.680,00:18:41.720,"Briefly, it comes from our ""circle culture""."
00:18:41.600,00:18:42.200,文化有关,,,
00:18:42.240,00:18:42.680,我,,,
00:18:42.720,00:18:43.560,讲的圈子文化,00:18:41.720,00:18:44.260,"Not the ""circle culture"" in a negative sense."
00:18:43.560,00:18:44.080,没有贬,,,
00:18:44.080,00:18:45.040,比较中性的,00:18:44.260,00:18:45.340,It's neutral.
00:18:45.040,00:18:46.160,就是中国人,,,
00:18:46.400,00:18:47.400,他比较合群,00:18:45.340,00:18:49.120,"Chinese people likes to be in a circle and
we can create a few chat groups a day."
00:18:47.400,00:18:49.240,他一天可以拉几个群,,,
00:18:49.960,00:18:52.520,中国文化中结群相对比较容易,00:18:49.520,00:18:52.300,It's easy to form a group in the Chinese culture.
00:18:52.520,00:18:53.880,另外还有一个很重要,,,
00:18:53.920,00:18:55.000,就是中国的文字,00:18:52.760,00:18:55.980,"Another important reason is the Chinese language,
according to my personal findings."
00:18:55.000,00:18:56.360,是我的发现,,,
00:18:56.760,00:18:58.360,中国的文字非常紧凑,00:18:56.580,00:18:58.415,The Chinese characters are compact.
00:18:58.360,00:19:00.840,一个小小的手机屏幕,,,
00:19:01.400,00:19:03.520,中国文字可以处理的东西,00:18:58.700,00:19:05.240,"The Chinese language can provide way more
information on a small screen than western scripts."
00:19:03.520,00:19:05.560,比西方文字要多得多,,,
00:19:05.920,00:19:08.400,所以这个也带来很大的优势,00:19:06.040,00:19:08.580,This also gives us an edge.
00:19:08.400,00:19:10.160,这以后可以再谈,00:19:08.580,00:19:10.700,I can talk about this another time.
00:19:10.640,00:19:13.200,我觉得还有一点就是红色文化,00:19:10.700,00:19:13.080,"The last thing I'd like to mention is the red culture
[relating to the lifestyles during communist revolutions]."
00:19:14.800,00:19:16.200,我经常讲这个话,,,
00:19:16.200,00:19:17.960,人民共和国是打仗打出来的,00:19:14.800,00:19:17.900,I often say the people's republic was born out of wars.
00:19:18.320,00:19:19.080,打伤打车,,,
00:19:19.080,00:19:20.560,他有种精神在里面,00:19:18.400,00:19:22.640,"The red culture is the spirit that supported us through
the wars and an important heritage."
00:19:21.040,00:19:23.360,红色文化上非常重要的资源,,,
00:19:23.720,00:19:26.600,那么我有一个台湾的朋友,00:19:23.740,00:19:26.620,"One of my Taiwanese friends,"
00:19:26.960,00:19:28.440,原来是国民党的一个学者,00:19:26.680,00:19:29.435,"who was a senior scholar of the KMT,"
00:19:28.440,00:19:29.360,资深学者,,,
00:19:29.400,00:19:30.480,他说他研究,,,
00:19:30.520,00:19:30.600,了,,,
00:19:31.400,00:19:32.640,国共他叫国国,00:19:29.440,00:19:33.260,"told me he found that KMT lost the Chinese Civil War,"
00:19:32.680,00:19:33.400,共内战,,,
00:19:33.400,00:19:34.720,我们在解放战争的时候,00:19:33.260,00:19:35.245,"or what the CPC call the Liberation War,"
00:19:34.720,00:19:36.800,为什么国民党输给了共产党,,,
00:19:36.800,00:19:38.680,他说我发觉他半开玩笑,00:19:35.245,00:19:39.060,"he said this half jokingly,"
00:19:38.680,00:19:39.560,半认真,,,
00:19:39.800,00:19:40.000,说,,,
00:19:41.520,00:19:42.480,中共他说有,00:19:39.820,00:19:44.660,because the CPC had red songs.
00:19:43.320,00:19:45.440,红色文化有红歌,,,
00:19:45.480,00:19:46.800,国民党没有,00:19:45.100,00:19:47.080,The KMT didn't have those.
00:19:46.920,00:19:49.240,国民党的歌都是他叫软不拉叽的,00:19:47.080,00:19:49.460,"He said the KMT songs were so dull,"
00:19:51.320,00:19:52.760,他国民党党歌也不行,00:19:50.140,00:19:55.480,both the anthem of the KMT and anthem of the Republic of China
00:19:53.640,00:19:54.920,所谓中华民国国歌,,,
00:19:54.920,00:19:56.000,也是软不拉叽,,,
00:19:56.320,00:19:57.960,他是跟你们义勇军进行曲,,,
00:19:58.000,00:19:58.720,是没法比,00:19:56.320,00:19:59.980,"when compared to ""March of the Volunteers""
[anthem of the People's Republic of China]."
00:20:00.160,00:20:02.040,背后却是不一样的精神,00:20:00.240,00:20:02.260,The spirits behind them are different.
00:20:02.480,00:20:03.560,那么在西方国家,,,
00:20:03.560,00:20:05.080,因为我在那生活时间比较长,00:20:02.480,00:20:06.960,"I lived in western countries for a long time where
I found that a lot of people were in low spirits."
00:20:05.360,00:20:07.440,精神低迷的人比较多,,,
00:20:08.840,00:20:10.160,有时候我就有一个,,,
00:20:10.160,00:20:12.840,真的有一些学生精神非常低迷,00:20:08.260,00:20:15.180,Some of of students told me they had to take medicine to feel better.
00:20:12.840,00:20:14.160,然后就说我在吃药,,,
00:20:14.160,00:20:15.440,要提升精神,,,
00:20:15.480,00:20:16.440,我在心里想,,,
00:20:16.720,00:20:17.080,到,,,
00:20:17.120,00:20:18.200,中国来唱红歌,00:20:15.560,00:20:18.960,"I was thinking what about sending
them to sing the red songs in China."
00:20:18.320,00:20:19.440,对吧,,,
00:20:19.600,00:20:20.640,有种集体生活,,,
00:20:20.640,00:20:21.800,乍着红歌,00:20:19.680,00:20:22.100,Experience the mommunal lifestyle.
00:20:22.040,00:20:23.000,我这些红歌,,,
00:20:23.040,00:20:24.760,曾经经历过,,,
00:20:24.760,00:20:26.040,整个民族,00:20:22.100,00:20:27.640,The songs inspired our entire nation to fight and strive.
00:20:26.160,00:20:26.760,去奋斗,,,
00:20:26.760,00:20:27.400,去抗住,,,
00:20:27.400,00:20:29.280,是一种刚阳之气,00:20:27.860,00:20:29.440,It's a positive energy.
00:20:30.400,00:20:31.480,有时候,,,
00:20:31.680,00:20:33.480,我就讲中国这个模式,00:20:29.860,00:20:36.000,China's [development] mode is difficult to duplicate.
00:20:33.480,00:20:34.400,确实是,,,
00:20:34.960,00:20:36.600,别的国家很难照搬,,,
00:20:36.800,00:20:37.440,有重要原因,,,
00:20:37.480,00:20:38.200,就我讲的,,,
00:20:38.760,00:20:39.800,人民共和国打仗,00:20:36.720,00:20:40.460,One important reason is that the people fought for the republic through wars.
00:20:39.800,00:20:42.120,打出来的是可以对美国说no的,00:20:40.460,00:20:42.280,We are able to say no to America.
00:20:42.120,00:20:42.560,爱,,,
00:20:42.640,00:20:44.160,一般国家没有能力,00:20:42.760,00:20:44.540,Few countries can do that.
00:20:44.600,00:20:45.840,所以这个非常重要,00:20:44.860,00:20:46.180,This is very important.
00:20:46.160,00:20:47.120,那么,,,
00:20:47.160,00:20:48.160,走遍世界,,,
00:20:48.440,00:20:48.960,我想,,,
00:20:49.440,00:20:51.440,接触过各种各样的文化,00:20:46.180,00:20:53.360,All the cultures around the world have their advantages.
00:20:52.000,00:20:53.440,都有长处,,,
00:20:53.560,00:20:54.720,那么,,,
00:20:54.760,00:20:55.640,各种各样的差异,00:20:53.580,00:20:56.640,All their differences are admirable.
00:20:55.640,00:20:56.840,我觉得非常精彩,,,
00:20:56.840,00:20:59.920,不同文化确实需要文明互鉴,00:20:56.640,00:21:01.240,Different cultures and civilizations need to learn from one another.
00:20:59.920,00:21:00.760,文化互鉴,,,
00:21:00.760,00:21:01.880,互相学习,,,
00:21:02.360,00:21:03.680,但我有一个感觉,,,
00:21:03.680,00:21:05.840,就是中国人有几点,00:21:02.440,00:21:07.300,"However, I feel that the Chinese people
have a few qualities contributing to the rise of China."
00:21:05.880,00:21:07.600,跟我们的崛起绝对有关,,,
00:21:07.600,00:21:09.840,都是文化方面的因素,00:21:07.640,00:21:10.140,They are all cultural factor.
00:21:10.040,00:21:13.240,一个就是中国人的勤劳走遍世界,00:21:10.140,00:21:12.480,The first is diligence.
00:21:13.280,00:21:15.200,中国人就是最勤劳的爱,00:21:12.480,00:21:15.275,The Chinese people are the most hard-working.
00:21:15.320,00:21:16.360,你换一个国家,,,
00:21:16.360,00:21:16.960,找不到的,,,
00:21:16.960,00:21:17.440,给他钱,00:21:15.520,00:21:18.780,"In other countries, you can't even pay people to do what we do."
00:21:17.480,00:21:17.840,他都不,,,
00:21:17.880,00:21:18.880,干I,,,
00:21:19.560,00:21:22.360,第2个就是民族整体的向上,00:21:19.475,00:21:22.175,The second is our motivation as a nation.
00:21:22.600,00:21:26.600,他总是要想办法改变自己命运,00:21:22.500,00:21:26.320,We always search for the way to change our fate.
00:21:27.000,00:21:27.760,然后,,,
00:21:28.960,00:21:29.680,很多民族,00:21:27.020,00:21:30.740,This is not a quality of many nations.
00:21:29.720,00:21:31.200,他不一定有这个特质,,,
00:21:31.680,00:21:33.640,所以我觉得中国崛起和特质,00:21:31.700,00:21:34.795,China's rise can be attributed to this quality and the culture.
00:21:33.640,00:21:34.640,也是文化特质,,,
00:21:34.680,00:21:35.720,也有关系,,,
00:21:36.040,00:21:40.120,另外民族整体的文化中,00:21:36.100,00:21:40.920,The third is a cultural disfavor of violence.
00:21:40.120,00:21:41.400,不崇尚暴力,,,
00:21:41.600,00:21:43.040,整体比较平和,00:21:41.380,00:21:44.260,We are a peaceful nation overall.
00:21:43.240,00:21:44.480,那么你比方说,,,
00:21:44.480,00:21:46.400,如果你去过美国在那生活过,,,
00:21:46.400,00:21:48.240,你没听说美国人讲饭后散步,00:21:44.260,00:21:48.860,"If you have lived in America, do you see people taking a walk after dinner?"
00:21:48.280,00:21:49.280,不喝,,,
00:21:49.320,00:21:50.160,饭后怎么散步,,,
00:21:50.160,00:21:50.800,对不对,00:21:49.380,00:21:51.795,They don't feel safe to.
00:21:50.840,00:21:52.040,你没有安全感,,,
00:21:52.120,00:21:53.200,在纽约,,,
00:21:53.200,00:21:55.240,除了重兵保护的,,,
00:21:55.360,00:21:56.280,一些景点,00:21:52.200,00:21:59.400,"In New York, for example, expect for the guarded
tourist sites such as Times Square and Broadway,"
00:21:56.280,00:21:58.360,时代广场等等百老汇,,,
00:21:58.880,00:21:59.760,你可以散步,,,
00:21:59.760,00:22:00.720,多数地方,,,
00:22:00.720,00:22:02.320,晚上是不能去散步的,00:21:59.840,00:22:02.680,you wouldn't want to go out for a walk at night.
00:22:03.320,00:22:05.760,巴黎也是很好的一个城市,00:22:03.200,00:22:04.540,"Same with Paris,"
00:22:05.760,00:22:08.040,但是你们如果最近去巴黎,00:22:04.540,00:22:06.100,"it's a nice city,"
00:22:08.040,00:22:09.400,当地华人就有个说法,00:22:06.100,00:22:10.120,but recently the local Chinese expats say
00:22:09.400,00:22:10.120,说是,,,
00:22:11.000,00:22:12.280,现在只有两种话语,00:22:11.100,00:22:12.760,"""There are only two types of Chinese people in Paris."""
00:22:12.280,00:22:13.680,一种是被抢过的,,,
00:22:13.720,00:22:14.960,一种是将要被抢,00:22:12.760,00:22:16.460,"""Either robbed or to be robbed."""
00:22:17.520,00:22:18.640,我就讲过这个例子,,,
00:22:18.640,00:22:21.240,我说如果今天晚上突然停电,00:22:17.600,00:22:21.160,"If all the cities went into a power outage tonight,"
00:22:21.640,00:22:22.920,上海停电了,,,
00:22:22.960,00:22:24.040,伦敦也停电了,00:22:21.160,00:22:25.660,"Shanghai, London, Paris, and New York."
00:22:24.040,00:22:24.920,巴黎也停电,,,
00:22:24.960,00:22:26.120,纽约也停电了,,,
00:22:26.680,00:22:28.240,没有警察干预的话,00:22:26.780,00:22:28.480,"Without police intervention,"
00:22:28.400,00:22:31.400,肯定是纽约市最糟糕的I其实是,00:22:28.480,00:22:30.380,New York would surely be the worst.
00:22:31.400,00:22:32.160,伦敦,,,
00:22:32.160,00:22:33.240,然后是巴黎,00:22:31.000,00:22:33.420,Followed by London and then Paris.
00:22:33.360,00:22:34.720,最有可能在上海,00:22:33.420,00:22:35.240,Shanghai would probably be the best.
00:22:35.640,00:22:35.920,所以,,,
00:22:36.640,00:22:38.120,中国的治安,,,
00:22:38.120,00:22:39.360,或者上海的时代,00:22:35.740,00:22:40.540,"Shanghai or China's public security is the best among the world,"
00:22:39.360,00:22:40.840,都是世界最好,,,
00:22:40.840,00:22:42.360,有时候都不大想家之一,00:22:40.600,00:22:43.180,"I don't really want to say ""one of""."
00:22:42.400,00:22:42.680,一,,,
00:22:44.120,00:22:44.960,肯定是,,,
00:22:45.160,00:22:48.400,属于世界最好的类别里边的,00:22:43.740,00:22:48.040,It's definitely among the first class in the world.
00:22:48.600,00:22:49.880,这种安全感,,,
00:22:50.040,00:22:53.000,并不完全是因为警察,00:22:48.640,00:22:54.400,"The sense of security not only
comes from the hard work of the police,"
00:22:53.080,00:22:54.880,公安的功劳,,,
00:22:54.920,00:22:56.760,因为我们过去也是相当安全,,,
00:22:56.800,00:22:57.920,在没有高科技,00:22:55.000,00:22:59.720,we used to be safe without the technologies and police capacity today.
00:22:57.920,00:22:59.360,没有这么大的警力的时候,,,
00:22:59.400,00:23:00.120,也是的,,,
00:23:00.200,00:23:02.040,我觉得跟这个民族,,,
00:23:02.200,00:23:02.960,我们这个民族,00:23:00.440,00:23:05.180,I believe it's because of our respect for peace as a nation.
00:23:03.000,00:23:05.680,崇尚和平的文化有关系,,,
00:23:05.680,00:23:06.360,在中国,,,
00:23:06.360,00:23:08.600,你开车开到任何一个村庄,00:23:05.760,00:23:10.060,You can drive to any village in China and feel safe.
00:23:08.600,00:23:10.120,你感觉是安全,,,
00:23:10.400,00:23:11.880,你跟你老乡聊天,00:23:10.500,00:23:13.040,You can talk to the folks there and buy their produce.
00:23:11.920,00:23:13.320,买他的土特产,,,
00:23:14.320,00:23:16.600,坦率说在任何一个国家,00:23:14.320,00:23:18.480,"Frankly speaking, it's a luxury for any county"
00:23:16.640,00:23:17.360,你要这样做,,,
00:23:17.360,00:23:18.560,都相当奢侈,,,
00:23:18.560,00:23:20.000,绝大多数国家至少,00:23:18.480,00:23:20.140,or most countries today.
00:23:20.280,00:23:21.400,所以我觉得,,,
00:23:22.440,00:23:22.920,一出国,,,
00:23:22.920,00:23:24.080,你就会感觉到了,00:23:20.480,00:23:26.120,Security feels like oxygen.
00:23:24.120,00:23:25.280,这种安全感,,,
00:23:25.280,00:23:26.320,它跟空气一样,,,
00:23:26.480,00:23:27.280,的爱,,,
00:23:27.320,00:23:27.880,有的时候,00:23:26.340,00:23:29.220,You don't feel it when you have it.
00:23:27.920,00:23:29.360,你不一定感觉的出来,,,
00:23:29.640,00:23:30.760,但没有的时候,,,
00:23:30.760,00:23:31.960,一下就感觉出来了,00:23:29.640,00:23:32.960,But you feel how crucial it is when you suddenly lose it.
00:23:31.960,00:23:33.120,太珍贵了,,,
00:23:33.600,00:23:35.640,所以我觉得确实是,,,
00:23:35.840,00:23:36.280,世界上,00:23:33.700,00:23:37.960,"The more places you visit in the world,"
00:23:36.280,00:23:38.400,你走的地方越多,,,
00:23:38.520,00:23:40.400,你就越会热爱这个国家,00:23:37.960,00:23:40.660,the more you will love your country
00:23:40.400,00:23:41.800,又会珍惜这个国家,,,
00:23:41.800,00:23:42.520,许多,,,
00:23:42.680,00:23:46.680,普普通通的这种文化的种种表现,00:23:40.660,00:23:47.140,and appreciate the ordinary cultural practices in your country.
00:23:46.720,00:23:47.800,非常精彩,,,
00:23:48.000,00:23:48.400,怎么样,,,
00:23:48.400,00:23:49.200,我今天就讲这些,,,
00:23:49.200,00:23:49.640,好不好,00:23:48.220,00:23:50.760,How about I stop here for today?
00:23:49.640,00:23:50.520,谢谢大家,,,
00:23:52.960,00:23:53.200,好,,,
00:23:53.200,00:23:54.520,掌声送给张教授,00:23:52.740,00:23:55.420,"Thank you, Professor Zhang. Have a seat."
00:23:54.520,00:23:55.400,您请坐,,,
00:23:55.520,00:23:57.160,请坐先问一个,00:23:56.260,00:23:58.520,I have a personal question.
00:23:57.640,00:23:58.560,个人的问题,,,
00:23:58.800,00:24:00.600,大家知道张教授,,,
00:24:00.640,00:24:01.480,在最早的时候,,,
00:24:01.480,00:24:03.560,他年轻时代做过党和国家,00:23:58.520,00:24:04.940,"We know that Prof. Zhang was the translator of
our national leaders when he was young,"
00:24:03.600,00:24:05.640,导人的翻译,,,
00:24:05.680,00:24:07.240,其中也包括邓小平同志,00:24:05.520,00:24:07.440,including Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
00:24:07.240,00:24:08.960,他经常陪着他们去出访,00:24:07.440,00:24:10.160,Prof. Zhang visited other countries with them.
00:24:08.960,00:24:10.800,所以您在公派的时候,,,
00:24:10.880,00:24:12.000,出国的时候带什么,00:24:10.160,00:24:12.940,I'm not going to ask what you brought for an official visit.
00:24:12.000,00:24:12.920,我就不问了,,,
00:24:12.920,00:24:14.360,我特别想知道的是,,,
00:24:14.360,00:24:18.080,当您第1次就自个出国的时候,00:24:13.160,00:24:19.120,"But I'm really curious to know what you
brought on your first personal trip abroad."
00:24:18.360,00:24:19.920,因为我们之前编前会,,,
00:24:20.000,00:24:21.360,我们有讨论过这个问题,00:24:19.120,00:24:21.760,Because we were talking about this in the production meeting.
00:24:21.480,00:24:22.760,说你第1次出国的时候,,,
00:24:23.200,00:24:24.200,你带什么这个问题,00:24:21.960,00:24:24.560,Everyone was sharing about what the brought on their first trip abroad.
00:24:24.240,00:24:25.640,我想现场问一下,,,
00:24:25.680,00:24:26.240,张老师,,,
00:24:26.240,00:24:27.400,您第1次出国的时候,00:24:24.560,00:24:28.140,So I'd like to ask Prof. Zhang this question today.
00:24:27.400,00:24:28.440,带的是什么,,,
00:24:28.480,00:24:29.920,你说个人出国是吧,00:24:28.420,00:24:30.040,"- You asked about my first personal trip?
- Yes."
00:24:30.000,00:24:31.480,我先讲就是公派出,00:24:30.220,00:24:32.020,I can start with diplomatic visits.
00:24:31.840,00:24:33.000,那个时候很有意思,,,
00:24:34.440,00:24:35.400,因为那个时候,00:24:32.020,00:24:37.100,It was very interesting. Our salary was very low at that time.
00:24:36.240,00:24:37.560,工资非常低,,,
00:24:38.520,00:24:40.920,当时我在外交部翻译室工作,00:24:38.120,00:24:40.680,"I was working at the translation department
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
00:24:41.080,00:24:42.680,第1次出国怎么出国,,,
00:24:43.080,00:24:44.800,它都有统一的一个房间,00:24:41.140,00:24:47.100,We had a room to borrow luggage and overcoats.
00:24:44.800,00:24:45.880,里边有行李,,,
00:24:45.920,00:24:46.760,有大一,,,
00:24:46.760,00:24:49.360,你都是借的开个借条,00:24:47.680,00:24:49.680,We needed to sign IOUs.
00:24:50.040,00:24:51.520,都借的要回来,00:24:49.760,00:24:51.720,"Yeah, everything was borrowed."
00:24:51.520,00:24:52.400,要还的对,,,
00:24:52.720,00:24:53.200,对,00:24:51.720,00:24:54.360,"- Like uniforms?
- Yes."
00:24:53.280,00:24:54.240,对工作服,,,
00:24:54.480,00:24:56.760,第1次我是去泰国,00:24:54.680,00:24:56.840,My first visit was to Thailand.
00:24:57.080,00:24:58.160,那么当时,,,
00:24:59.640,00:25:01.000,是去联合国开一个会,00:24:57.040,00:25:01.720,I was translating for a UN meeting.
00:25:01.000,00:25:04.240,做翻译I因为第1次出国很新鲜,00:25:02.880,00:25:05.620,"I had never gone abroad before,"
00:25:04.400,00:25:04.760,对吧,,,
00:25:05.880,00:25:07.920,就尽量查各种各样材料,,,
00:25:07.920,00:25:09.840,然后买一些相关的书籍,00:25:05.880,00:25:10.700,and I did lots of research and bought books [about Thailand].
00:25:09.840,00:25:11.120,看一看了解点,,,
00:25:11.240,00:25:12.640,当时非常好奇,,,
00:25:13.160,00:25:13.920,然后到泰国,00:25:11.340,00:25:16.000,"I was very curious, and found
Thailand was so advanced after we arrived."
00:25:13.960,00:25:16.400,发觉泰国太先进了,,,
00:25:16.400,00:25:17.520,领先上海二十年,,,
00:25:17.680,00:25:19.560,当时的感觉19八3年,00:25:16.380,00:25:19.640,I felt it was 20 years ahead of Shanghai.
00:25:20.240,00:25:20.760,对,,,
00:25:21.960,00:25:22.760,其实,,,
00:25:22.800,00:25:23.280,证明他,00:25:21.720,00:25:24.280,You didn't answer the question.
00:25:23.320,00:25:23.840,为什么,,,
00:25:24.040,00:25:24.320,对,,,
00:25:24.360,00:25:25.120,他说了,,,
00:25:25.120,00:25:25.800,因为时间,00:25:24.660,00:25:25.800,Books?
00:25:25.840,00:25:27.160,间长了可能,00:25:25.800,00:25:28.280,It was quite long ago for Professor Zhang to remember the details.
00:25:27.200,00:25:28.680,不是特别记得细节,,,
00:25:28.960,00:25:29.680,我想问一个,,,
00:25:29.680,00:25:31.120,很多人想挑战的问题,00:25:28.960,00:25:32.380,I have a question that many people would challenge.
00:25:32.200,00:25:33.760,一出国爱国是个,,,
00:25:33.800,00:25:34.000,大家,,,
00:25:34.040,00:25:35.080,中国人都想家,00:25:32.380,00:25:36.320,"""Go abroad and love China more"" because we miss home naturally."
00:25:35.240,00:25:36.720,就很自然而然的事情,,,
00:25:36.720,00:25:38.360,你干嘛把它上纲上线,,,
00:25:38.360,00:25:39.680,跟政治经济挂钩,00:25:37.100,00:25:40.020,Why would you make it about politics and economy.
00:25:39.800,00:25:41.240,这是不是有点牵强,00:25:40.020,00:25:41.680,Is that far-fetched?
00:25:41.560,00:25:43.520,不实际上当时是有个背景,,,
00:25:43.520,00:25:46.680,就是西方或者亲西方的工资,00:25:41.980,00:25:46.520,"The context for that statement was the
west and pro-western public intellectuals"
00:25:46.680,00:25:49.520,老是拿这一点攻击人民共和国,00:25:46.520,00:25:48.960,were attacking the PRC.
00:25:49.640,00:25:51.240,说你们的制度不行,00:25:49.360,00:25:51.440,"They said, ""Your system will fail."""
00:25:51.680,00:25:52.880,人家都想离开,00:25:51.440,00:25:53.120,"""Everyone wanted to leave."""
00:25:53.080,00:25:55.400,你看你们这移民潮一浪接一浪,00:25:53.120,00:25:55.120,"""There's one wave after another in the emigration tide."""
00:25:55.720,00:25:57.000,我说你数据在哪里,00:25:55.440,00:25:57.740,"I asked, ""Where is the data?"""
00:25:57.000,00:25:58.080,对不对,,,
00:25:58.120,00:25:59.880,没有数据支撑的,00:25:58.100,00:26:00.000,No data was supporting their statement.
00:25:59.880,00:26:01.760,所以我就说一出国就爱国,00:26:00.000,00:26:02.080,"So I said ""go abroad and love China more""."
00:26:02.080,00:26:03.840,我说我鼓励他们走,,,
00:26:03.880,00:26:05.520,是可以成建制的走,00:26:02.080,00:26:06.300,"I encourage them to leave, even in organized groups."
00:26:05.520,00:26:06.440,对不对,,,
00:26:06.480,00:26:09.240,送他们去跟美国谈一个D不,00:26:06.720,00:26:09.180,Get a deal with America and send them out.
00:26:09.240,00:26:10.080,你可以明摆着,,,
00:26:10.080,00:26:10.680,你算一算,,,
00:26:10.720,00:26:13.000,实际上真正的移民国家,00:26:09.180,00:26:12.880,"If you calculate the immigrant populations of major immigration countries,"
00:26:13.200,00:26:14.920,现在美国都很难算了,,,
00:26:14.920,00:26:16.080,因为特朗普上台了,00:26:13.320,00:26:18.260,"the U.S. used to be the largest but now it's not truly
welcoming immigrants under Trump,"
00:26:16.120,00:26:18.600,过去美国算一个最大的移民国家,,,
00:26:18.880,00:26:19.800,还有加拿大,,,
00:26:19.840,00:26:20.680,澳大利亚,,,
00:26:20.920,00:26:22.520,奥赛加那都是人口,00:26:18.900,00:26:25.300,and Canada and Australia which have much smaller populations.
00:26:22.520,00:26:23.160,小国,,,
00:26:23.160,00:26:24.160,一两千万,,,
00:26:24.160,00:26:25.800,就美国是个大国,,,
00:26:26.040,00:26:27.480,三个国家加在一起,,,
00:26:27.480,00:26:28.800,每年能够吸引多少,00:26:26.240,00:26:29.180,"If we count the three countries all together,
how many immigrants do they receive every year?"
00:26:28.800,00:26:30.560,四五十万了不得了,00:26:29.180,00:26:31.580,Half a million?
00:26:31.440,00:26:32.840,哪怕这四五十万中国人,00:26:31.580,00:26:33.760,"And if all the immigrants were all from China,"
00:26:32.880,00:26:34.800,包了移民才多少,00:26:33.860,00:26:35.000,that's still a small number.
00:26:34.800,00:26:35.720,我们一个,,,
00:26:36.560,00:26:37.480,1000万人,00:26:35.000,00:26:37.300,Suzhou City itself has 10 million people.
00:26:39.040,00:26:40.240,就从比例上看,,,
00:26:40.240,00:26:41.120,其实以前我,00:26:39.180,00:26:41.860,"- If we look at the proportions ...
- Our one community has that many people."
00:26:41.160,00:26:42.040,区就有很多,,,
00:26:42.120,00:26:42.440,对,,,
00:26:42.440,00:26:44.760,以前我们还说可能比较感性,00:26:42.600,00:26:44.740,"Yes, we used to think it was subjective."
00:26:44.760,00:26:46.680,但是这两年数据越来越多,,,
00:26:46.680,00:26:48.560,留学生回国的比例,00:26:44.840,00:26:50.500,"But the data in the last 2 years shows over 80%
of the Chinese students abroad chose to come back."
00:26:48.560,00:26:49.560,我记得最新的数据,,,
00:26:49.560,00:26:50.760,是百分之八十几,,,
00:26:50.840,00:26:51.320,最典型的,,,
00:26:51.320,00:26:52.000,我记得前几年,00:26:50.720,00:26:53.260,"An example is the movie ""American Dreams in China"".
[based on a real story]"
00:26:52.160,00:26:53.000,中国合伙人,,,
00:26:53.040,00:26:54.720,三个大学同学,00:26:53.260,00:26:56.040,Three college friends wanted to go to America.
00:26:54.720,00:26:56.120,都想去美国学,,,
00:26:56.120,00:26:56.760,最后发现,,,
00:26:57.200,00:26:58.880,万一最好的没出去,00:26:56.300,00:26:59.200,But the one that spoke the best English couldn't go.
00:26:58.880,00:26:59.360,对不对,,,
00:26:59.400,00:27:01.000,然后这三个人的经历比下来,,,
00:27:01.040,00:27:01.880,你会发现什么,00:26:59.600,00:27:03.540,"And it turned out that the one who
stayed in China had the highest career achievements."
00:27:01.920,00:27:03.040,留在中国的事业,,,
00:27:03.040,00:27:03.800,成就最好,,,
00:27:03.840,00:27:05.400,英文中有一个短语,,,
00:27:05.400,00:27:08.840,叫the test用脚投票,00:27:03.540,00:27:08.340,"There's this English expression, ""vote by feet""."
00:27:09.040,00:27:09.960,西方过去讲,,,
00:27:09.960,00:27:11.880,中国老想用这个案例,00:27:09.040,00:27:13.500,"The west would alway say the Chinese people ""voted by feet"""
00:27:12.240,00:27:13.320, the best,,,
00:27:13.320,00:27:14.440,你们老百姓,,,
00:27:14.480,00:27:15.000,你们很多人,,,
00:27:15.000,00:27:15.920,都要离开国家,00:27:13.500,00:27:17.060,and lest their county.
00:27:15.920,00:27:17.240,这用脚投票,,,
00:27:17.680,00:27:18.680,就说,,,
00:27:18.720,00:27:19.840,后来我就举个例子,,,
00:27:19.880,00:27:22.280,我说你看看我们的台湾同胞,00:27:17.500,00:27:22.980,I told them they could look at our compatriots in Taiwan.
00:27:22.280,00:27:22.720,对不对,,,
00:27:22.760,00:27:23.840,我当时了解数据,,,
00:27:23.840,00:27:24.720,150万,,,
00:27:24.720,00:27:26.560,最保守的估计四年前,00:27:23.060,00:27:28.020,"Four years ago, a conservative estimate of 1.5 million
students from Taiwan chose to stay in Chinese mainland."
00:27:26.560,00:27:28.360,在大陆生活工作学习,,,
00:27:28.440,00:27:30.040,现在有没有最准确的数目,00:27:28.380,00:27:30.020,Do we have an updated number?
00:27:30.720,00:27:32.040,现在超过200,00:27:30.460,00:27:31.640,Over 2 million.
00:27:32.080,00:27:32.880,超过200万,00:27:31.960,00:27:33.220,Over 2 million.
00:27:33.600,00:27:35.120,如果你愿意把政治化着,00:27:33.580,00:27:36.120,"If you politicalize this, it is their ""vote by feet""."
00:27:35.120,00:27:36.440,就把信,,,
00:27:36.480,00:27:37.960,现在已经最新的数据,,,
00:27:38.000,00:27:39.440,是年轻人,00:27:36.340,00:27:42.280,"The latests data shows that over 50% of the
young people want to study or work in mainland."
00:27:39.440,00:27:41.320,希望大学毕业以后,,,
00:27:41.360,00:27:43.000,或者来大陆上大学,,,
00:27:43.000,00:27:44.800,超过50%的比例,00:27:43.180,00:27:45.740,Young people in Taiwan.
00:27:44.840,00:27:46.320,台湾的年轻人,,,
00:27:46.400,00:27:47.240,这一个相当高,00:27:46.260,00:27:47.980,That's a high proportion.
00:27:47.280,00:27:48.200,比例,,,
00:27:48.240,00:27:50.280,我之前在英国拍过一个纪录片,,,
00:27:50.320,00:27:50.920,记录,00:27:48.220,00:27:53.100,"I remember a British documentary about
the lives of illegal immigrants in the UK."
00:27:50.920,00:27:53.720,中国的偷渡客在英国的生活,,,
00:27:53.760,00:27:54.920,当时很多偷渡客,,,
00:27:54.920,00:27:55.760,为了留下来,00:27:53.780,00:27:57.660,A lot of them applied for political asylum in order to stay.
00:27:55.800,00:27:57.800,去申请政治庇护,,,
00:27:57.840,00:27:59.360,边种种的理由,00:27:57.940,00:27:59.480,They fabricated all kinds of reasons.
00:27:59.360,00:28:00.840,后来英国的移民官都知道了,,,
00:28:00.840,00:28:01.600,你编的经历,,,
00:28:01.600,00:28:02.880,我们听过100多遍了,00:27:59.580,00:28:04.440,"Later on, the British immigration officers
got tired hearing the same statements."
00:28:02.880,00:28:04.240,能不能换一个理由,,,
00:28:04.480,00:28:07.440,当时很多的福建沿海的偷渡客,00:28:04.440,00:28:08.035,"A lot of the immigrants were from
Fujian Province to the UK and the US."
00:28:07.440,00:28:08.080,去英国去,,,
00:28:08.080,00:28:09.200,美国现在,,,
00:28:09.360,00:28:11.200,其实我们去平潭去,00:28:08.460,00:28:13.280,"Now if we visit Pingtan, Changle, and Fuqing,
no one would want to emigrate illegale."
00:28:11.240,00:28:11.680,长乐,,,
00:28:11.720,00:28:12.240,清,,,
00:28:12.280,00:28:13.720,没有人愿意偷渡去了,,,
00:28:13.760,00:28:15.120,反而是之前去的,00:28:13.700,00:28:16.200,And many of the previous emigrates have come back.
00:28:15.160,00:28:16.200,纷纷回来了,,,
00:28:16.440,00:28:17.600,整个国家发展,,,
00:28:17.600,00:28:20.760,你从原来可能是比较阴暗细节,00:28:16.200,00:28:21.580,China's growth can be seen from this kind of dark aspect.
00:28:20.760,00:28:22.280,是体现得出来的,,,
00:28:22.320,00:28:23.520,我们想像十几年前,,,
00:28:23.520,00:28:25.240,我们看到的一些手机厂商,00:28:22.300,00:28:27.300,"If we recall the advertisements for
phones or software over 10 years ago,"
00:28:25.240,00:28:26.720,或者是软件提供商,,,
00:28:26.720,00:28:27.840,他们做的广告,,,
00:28:27.880,00:28:28.760,你看到的场面,,,
00:28:28.760,00:28:30.600,是一个超科技的场面,,,
00:28:30.600,00:28:32.560,周围有飞降的汽车,00:28:27.580,00:28:35.560,"we had futuristic scenes where there were cars flying
and a touch-screen device in your hand"
00:28:32.560,00:28:34.120,然后你手里的设备,,,
00:28:34.120,00:28:36.520,是一块完全的空白的一个屏幕,,,
00:28:36.560,00:28:38.400,想象可能就在这种情况下,,,
00:28:38.400,00:28:41.040,你才能做到一部终端全部搞定,00:28:36.180,00:28:41.020,with an integrated platform for everything.
00:28:41.680,00:28:43.280,我们国家在借用了,,,
00:28:43.560,00:28:45.840,先进的手机的发展之后,00:28:41.560,00:28:45.620,"China has taken advantage of the growth of mobile phone,"
00:28:45.840,00:28:47.240,我们利用自己国情的,,,
00:28:47.240,00:28:48.320,特殊的根基,,,
00:28:48.320,00:28:49.360,人口的众多,00:28:45.960,00:28:51.960,and our special reality of a large population and the love for life.
00:28:49.400,00:28:52.080,然后喜爱生活的向往,,,
00:28:52.080,00:28:54.480,直接就把这个东西直接先实现到,00:28:52.260,00:28:53.900,We have already implemented that.
00:28:54.480,00:28:55.400,所以说这是一种,,,
00:28:55.400,00:28:57.440,他们没有想象到的速度维度,00:28:54.500,00:28:57.800,But we didn't expect how fast this could be done.
00:28:57.440,00:28:59.120,会带来的不同的景象,,,
00:28:59.160,00:29:01.640,所以一出国就爱国这个话题,00:28:59.260,00:29:03.340,"What do our audience think about ""go abroad and love China more""?"
00:29:01.640,00:29:02.960,我们现场的朋友怎么看,,,
00:29:03.120,00:29:05.320,也想来期待大家的一个互动,00:29:03.340,00:29:05.300,I look forward to the discussions.
00:29:05.320,00:29:08.520,大家可以抛问题给张老师,00:29:05.460,00:29:07.940,Please throw your questions at Prof. Zhang.
00:29:08.920,00:29:10.040,不同观点可以或许,00:29:08.520,00:29:10.720,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:29:10.080,00:29:11.800,要讨论辩论,,,
00:29:13.440,00:29:15.000,眼都不害怕竞争,00:29:12.785,00:29:14.735,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:29:15.400,00:29:16.960,中国人你要自信,00:29:15.175,00:29:16.765,"China, be confident."
00:29:18.560,00:29:20.280,这就是中国,,,
00:29:20.280,00:29:22.080,听张维为说,00:29:18.260,00:29:22.640,"China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:29:24.600,00:29:25.920,中国人出国之后,,,
00:29:26.120,00:29:28.120,我叫做一出国就爱国,00:29:25.140,00:29:27.700,"I say the Chinese people ""go abroad and love China more""."
00:29:28.160,00:29:29.280,您第1次出国的时候,00:29:27.980,00:29:30.240,What did you take with you the first time you travelled abroad?
00:29:29.280,00:29:29.480,带的,,,
00:29:29.520,00:29:30.040,的是什么,,,
00:29:30.040,00:29:31.480,你干嘛把它上纲上线,,,
00:29:31.480,00:29:32.760,跟政治经济挂钩,00:29:30.240,00:29:32.960,Why would you make it about politics and economy?
00:29:32.960,00:29:34.600,党说要依靠群众,00:29:32.960,00:29:35.400,"The Communist Party said we must
rely on the masses and mobilize the masses."
00:29:34.600,00:29:35.280,发动群众,,,
00:29:35.280,00:29:37.240,能不能发挥我们群中这样的力量,00:29:35.400,00:29:36.980,Can we bring out the power of the people?
00:29:37.280,00:29:39.200,观察中国既要看竞技,00:29:37.260,00:29:40.720,"We need both a close-up and a long shot
when we observe China, don't we?"
00:29:39.200,00:29:39.720,也要看,,,
00:29:39.760,00:29:40.520,远景对吗,,,
00:29:40.520,00:29:42.920,90 95后是中国最自信的,00:29:40.720,00:29:43.340,"The post-90s and post-95s are
the most confident generation in China."

00:29:54.480,00:29:54.960,越难,,,
00:29:54.960,00:29:56.200,回答的问题越好,,,

00:29:58.400,00:29:59.280,张教授你好,00:29:58.320,00:30:00.140,"Hello, Professor Zhang."
00:29:59.520,00:30:01.680,我想提出一个,,,
00:30:01.680,00:30:03.480,我们文化输出的问题,00:30:00.140,00:30:04.200,I would like to ask a question about our cultural output.
00:30:03.480,00:30:04.280,就是说,,,
00:30:05.040,00:30:07.760,虽然说我们中国现在在世界上,00:30:04.620,00:30:10.100,"Although China has a strong economic
or political influence in the world,"
00:30:07.800,00:30:09.760,它的经济或者政治影响力,,,
00:30:09.760,00:30:11.040,还是非常大的,,,
00:30:11.040,00:30:12.240,但是我们的商业,,,
00:30:12.240,00:30:13.200,我们的文化,00:30:10.600,00:30:15.100,"our culture does not seem to have
synchronously grown in influence."
00:30:13.240,00:30:14.520,好像并没有得到,,,
00:30:15.400,00:30:16.160,同步的提高,,,
00:30:16.200,00:30:17.960,我想这是不是我们自己,,,
00:30:18.000,00:30:19.280,在对外输出,00:30:15.400,00:30:22.100,I wonder if we've been giving low priority to cultural exports.
00:30:19.320,00:30:20.760,我们自己的文化的时候,,,
00:30:20.800,00:30:22.360,有一个偏差的问题,,,
00:30:22.360,00:30:23.120,虽然我是工程师,,,
00:30:23.120,00:30:24.200,但是我也是一个,,,
00:30:24.240,00:30:25.840,中国传统文化的爱好者,00:30:22.520,00:30:26.080,I'm an engineer but I love China's traditional culture.
00:30:25.840,00:30:27.520,我觉得我们的输出的东西,,,
00:30:27.560,00:30:29.880,应该是具体更具有操作性,00:30:26.080,00:30:30.560,"I believe our cultural exports should be more specific,
more operable, and more practical."
00:30:29.880,00:30:30.560,实用性,,,
00:30:30.560,00:30:31.200,比如说我们,,,
00:30:32.000,00:30:33.600,传统里面中医的针灸,00:30:30.560,00:30:33.700,"For example, acupuncture in traditional Chinese medicine."
00:30:33.640,00:30:34.160,据我所知,,,
00:30:34.160,00:30:35.120,美国这方面,,,
00:30:35.160,00:30:36.920,他们至少有44个州,00:30:33.700,00:30:38.740,"As far as I know, at least 44 states in
the U.S. have legalized acupuncture."
00:30:36.920,00:30:39.000,它已经是把这种针灸合法化,,,
00:30:39.040,00:30:39.960,我明白您的问题,,,
00:30:40.000,00:30:41.160,不过想问一下,00:30:39.000,00:30:41.380,I understand your question.
00:30:41.600,00:30:43.440,您刚才说您是工程师,,,
00:30:43.440,00:30:44.000,是吧,00:30:41.380,00:30:45.635,I'd like to ask what your specialization is as an engineer.
00:30:44.040,00:30:45.880,您是研究哪一方面的专业,,,
00:30:45.920,00:30:47.480,我主要是做网络这块,00:30:45.880,00:30:47.220,Networking.
00:30:48.560,00:30:49.560,洛这块的工程师,00:30:47.500,00:30:51.455,A networking engineer interested in cultural issues.
00:30:49.560,00:30:51.280,但他关注的是文化问题,,,
00:30:51.280,00:30:53.240,而且特别关注还是中医的针灸,00:30:51.460,00:30:54.600,And he particularly talked about acupuncture.
00:30:54.560,00:30:55.240,非常,,,
00:30:55.320,00:30:55.840,的文化爱好的,,,
00:30:55.840,00:30:57.480,所以我平时这方面也比较关注,00:30:54.840,00:30:57.640,"I am a fan of our traditional culture, so I follow the news."
00:30:57.520,00:30:59.400,我觉得中国,,,
00:30:59.640,00:31:02.880,中国文化走出去是大势所趋,00:30:57.860,00:31:02.300,I think going global is the general trend for Chinese culture.
00:31:02.920,00:31:05.400,你只要看世界历史,,,
00:31:05.440,00:31:07.320,一个大国的崛起,00:31:03.120,00:31:09.700,Any country's rise in history is a rise of their culture.
00:31:07.400,00:31:10.120,背后一定是文化的崛起,,,
00:31:10.280,00:31:12.280,这个是色喷得慢的,00:31:10.320,00:31:12.280,"This is ""supply and demand""."
00:31:12.280,00:31:13.680,有巨大的需求,,,
00:31:13.680,00:31:15.560,让你的供给要跟上,00:31:12.280,00:31:15.635,"When there is a huge demand, the supply should keep up."
00:31:15.840,00:31:16.760,现在需求是,,,
00:31:16.800,00:31:17.600,越来越大,00:31:15.640,00:31:18.140,The demand has been increasing.
00:31:17.960,00:31:19.080,那么,,,
00:31:19.360,00:31:20.960,但是从供给方面,00:31:18.460,00:31:22.980,And we do have room for improvement on the supply side.
00:31:21.000,00:31:21.400,我觉得,,,
00:31:21.440,00:31:23.600,我们确实有改进的余地,,,
00:31:24.120,00:31:28.040,我觉得不能仅仅是一个一些简单,00:31:24.140,00:31:29.800,"Not only the simple things,
although they are necessary,"
00:31:28.080,00:31:28.320,的,,,
00:31:29.120,00:31:30.320,这东西也要做,,,
00:31:30.400,00:31:32.120,比方一些文化符号,,,
00:31:32.280,00:31:32.840,旗袍,,,
00:31:32.880,00:31:37.000,嗷嗷绿茶等等,00:31:30.380,00:31:36.480,"such as the cultural symbols: cheongsam, tea, and so on."
00:31:37.200,00:31:38.240,我觉得关键是,,,
00:31:38.240,00:31:41.680,把背后的一些中国人的理念,00:31:36.940,00:31:42.880,The key is to reveal the ideas behind them.
00:31:41.680,00:31:43.440,把它给揭示出来,,,
00:31:43.640,00:31:44.040,你比方说,,,
00:31:44.040,00:31:46.360,中国人珍惜和平这东西,00:31:43.540,00:31:46.020,"For example, the Chinese people cherish peace."
00:31:46.360,00:31:49.320,你要把做成一个文化的符号,00:31:46.020,00:31:50.860,It will be contagious if we make it a cultural symbol.
00:31:49.320,00:31:51.040,将会非常有感染力,,,
00:31:51.120,00:31:51.720,因为你有东西,,,
00:31:51.720,00:31:53.720,要产生全球方面的影响,00:31:51.160,00:31:55.175,"For something to have a global impact,"
00:31:53.760,00:31:54.640,全世界影响,,,
00:31:54.960,00:31:56.840,他带一点普世的意味,00:31:55.180,00:31:57.180,it must have universal significance.
00:31:56.840,00:31:57.960,就着这个价值,,,
00:31:58.000,00:32:00.360,大家觉得都是好东西,00:31:57.180,00:32:02.760,It will have greater penetration if everyone thinks it's good.
00:32:00.400,00:32:01.640,我觉得这个会有更大,,,
00:32:01.680,00:32:01.800,的,,,
00:32:02.360,00:32:03.080,穿透力,,,
00:32:03.080,00:32:05.560,所以我们倒真是可以从西方借鉴,00:32:03.120,00:32:05.260,We can learn from the West.
00:32:05.560,00:32:06.040,很多人,,,
00:32:06.160,00:32:06.880,崇洋媚外,,,
00:32:06.920,00:32:08.640,实际上是从文化开始,00:32:05.700,00:32:08.560,"A lot of the ""worshippers of the West""
started as the admirers of their cultures."
00:32:09.240,00:32:10.400,假如我是文化高,,,
00:32:10.440,00:32:11.280,你知道吗,00:32:09.320,00:32:12.640,"If they have a ""high-end culture"" or something like that,"
00:32:11.320,00:32:12.880,或者文化怎么样,,,
00:32:13.240,00:32:14.520,他这是很细心,,,
00:32:14.520,00:32:15.920,投入大量的精力,,,
00:32:15.920,00:32:17.240,慢工出细活,,,
00:32:17.240,00:32:18.960,出一些文化的产品,00:32:13.020,00:32:21.500,"they spend lots of time on the cultural exports
from packaging design to the product itself"
00:32:19.080,00:32:21.400,从个简单的包的设计到一个什么,,,
00:32:21.400,00:32:21.920,东西,,,
00:32:21.920,00:32:23.880,使你感到它的文化很优雅,00:32:22.000,00:32:24.320,to make you feel it is an elegant culture.
00:32:24.600,00:32:26.120,这一块是我们要做好的,,,
00:32:26.120,00:32:27.160,因为我们的文化,00:32:24.640,00:32:29.260,"Our culture has a ""commoner"" nature."
00:32:27.200,00:32:28.680,有一种平民的,,,
00:32:29.840,00:32:31.400,特质就是,,,
00:32:31.520,00:32:33.320,不管外国什么高大上的东西,,,
00:32:33.320,00:32:34.560,我们都可以把他吸引进来,00:32:30.000,00:32:36.880,We can draw anything high-end from other countries and localize it.
00:32:34.560,00:32:35.120,然后中国,,,
00:32:35.160,00:32:36.360,话对,,,
00:32:37.080,00:32:37.400,你,,,
00:32:37.440,00:32:37.760,外国的,,,
00:32:39.720,00:32:42.040,宫廷我们变成了广场舞,00:32:36.880,00:32:41.680,The court dance has become our square dance.
00:32:42.160,00:32:42.440,你,,,
00:32:42.640,00:32:43.200,外国的,,,
00:32:43.640,00:32:45.680,五线谱变成了简谱,00:32:42.220,00:32:45.320,The staff has been simplified to numbered musical notation.
00:32:45.840,00:32:48.560,我们的文化是有社会主义平民的,00:32:45.840,00:32:49.220,Our culture is related to the socialist commoner nature.
00:32:48.560,00:32:49.720,性质有关,,,
00:32:50.040,00:32:52.480,所以中国我觉得下一步,,,
00:32:52.960,00:32:55.120,在高雅文化,00:32:49.940,00:32:58.100,"So I think our next focus is high culture,
including high-end cultural products."
00:32:55.160,00:32:56.080,卧产品,,,
00:32:56.120,00:32:58.160,在往尖端高做到高端,,,
00:32:58.200,00:32:58.560,安,,,
00:32:58.560,00:32:59.440,然后让,,,
00:32:59.480,00:33:00.680,老外出大价钱,00:32:58.580,00:33:01.595,Other countries will spend a lot to buy our cultural products.
00:33:00.680,00:33:01.760,买你的文化产品,,,
00:33:01.800,00:33:03.440,我觉得天天也会到,00:33:01.600,00:33:03.835,I believe this day will come.
00:33:03.480,00:33:03.800,的,,,
00:33:03.840,00:33:04.240,对,,,
00:33:04.280,00:33:05.560,其实我想朋友们关心的,,,
00:33:05.600,00:33:06.080,就是,,,
00:33:06.080,00:33:07.360,怎么来让大家,00:33:03.920,00:33:08.780,Our friends care about how to make our culture better understood.
00:33:07.400,00:33:07.920,更好的,,,
00:33:07.920,00:33:09.160,认知我们的文化,,,
00:33:09.160,00:33:10.920,可能带有一些实用性的东西,,,
00:33:10.920,00:33:12.880,他们理解起来会更方便一点,00:33:09.320,00:33:13.340,Things with practical utility will be easier to understand.
00:33:12.920,00:33:13.480,对吧,,,
00:33:13.480,00:33:14.560,我给他拍一段影像,,,
00:33:14.600,00:33:16.000,他可能还理解半天,00:33:13.560,00:33:16.020,"If you just show them a video,
it still might take them a while to understand."
00:33:16.000,00:33:16.920,因为跟你的文化,,,
00:33:16.960,00:33:18.280,并不是直接相通,00:33:16.020,00:33:18.360,They cannot directly relate to our culture.
00:33:18.320,00:33:19.440,但如果说针灸,,,
00:33:19.680,00:33:20.880,或者是您刚才举的例子,00:33:18.360,00:33:21.400,"But the examples you gave, acupuncture or cheongsam,"
00:33:20.920,00:33:21.440,旗袍,,,
00:33:21.600,00:33:23.640,甚至您看大家还记不记得奥运会,,,
00:33:23.640,00:33:23.880,的时候,,,
00:33:23.920,00:33:25.040,有一则新闻说,00:33:21.600,00:33:27.700,"and if you remember the the mosquito nets that
the Chinese athletes brought abroad to the Olympics."
00:33:25.040,00:33:25.800,国外的运动员,,,
00:33:25.800,00:33:26.320,都看上了,,,
00:33:26.360,00:33:27.840,中国运动员戴的蚊帐,,,
00:33:27.840,00:33:29.320,是吧,,,
00:33:29.360,00:33:33.480,还有我们的什么刮痧拔罐,00:33:28.320,00:33:33.500,There's also scraping and cupping.
00:33:33.480,00:33:34.040,都觉得说,,,
00:33:34.240,00:33:35.240,这些传统的东西,,,
00:33:35.240,00:33:36.840,又简单又实用,00:33:33.660,00:33:36.860,They all feel that these traditional things are simple and useful.
00:33:36.840,00:33:38.840,但张老师刚才补充的特别棒,,,
00:33:38.840,00:33:39.720,就是在背后,00:33:36.860,00:33:41.500,"I like how Prof. Zhang said we need to let them
know the Chinese culture behind the things."
00:33:39.760,00:33:42.120,我们要让他知道中国的文化,,,
00:33:42.160,00:33:44.360,咱们一定要把中国文化的故事,00:33:42.040,00:33:45.300,We must make sure the stories are understood.
00:33:44.360,00:33:45.560,给讲透了,,,
00:33:45.800,00:33:46.120,好,,,
00:33:46.160,00:33:47.040,我们接下来再来看,00:33:46.040,00:33:48.080,"All right, does someone else have a question?"
00:33:47.080,00:33:47.920,有哪位朋友提问,,,
00:33:48.320,00:33:49.000,欢迎,00:33:48.080,00:33:49.280,Yes please.
00:33:49.640,00:33:51.120,其实这些年,,,
00:33:51.120,00:33:52.360,我们都能感受到,,,
00:33:52.360,00:33:53.440,我们国家的强大,00:33:49.700,00:33:55.500,"In recent years, we can feel China's growth
and the growth of national confidence."
00:33:53.440,00:33:55.800,以及整个民族自信心的一个增长,,,
00:33:55.800,00:33:58.120,但是伴随着的也是这些年,,,
00:33:58.120,00:34:00.360,GDP增长率的逐渐的下滑,00:33:56.160,00:34:03.260,"However, with the GDP gradually declining in recent
years, and a potential population crisis we will face,"
00:34:00.360,00:34:01.600,以及我们很有可能,,,
00:34:01.600,00:34:03.480,会面临的一个人口危机,,,
00:34:03.520,00:34:05.320,所以张教授您如何看待,00:34:03.560,00:34:05.900,"I'd like to ask Prof. Zhang,"
00:34:05.320,00:34:06.840,这两者之间的一个矛盾,,,
00:34:06.840,00:34:09.400,以及关系和背后藏着的隐忧,00:34:05.920,00:34:09.720,"what do you think about the contradiction between the
two and the relationship and the concerns behind it?"
00:34:10.280,00:34:11.800,非常尖锐的问题,00:34:10.020,00:34:13.360,"A very sharp question!
I'd like to ask what you're specialized in."
00:34:11.840,00:34:12.360,我先问一下,,,
00:34:12.400,00:34:13.520,您是什么专业的,,,
00:34:13.600,00:34:15.360,我本身是学生物工程,00:34:14.000,00:34:16.320,"I studied medical engineering and now
I am working in the medical industry."
00:34:15.360,00:34:15.920,现在做医疗,,,
00:34:15.960,00:34:17.520,行业号我,,,
00:34:17.560,00:34:18.120,我曾经,,,
00:34:18.560,00:34:23.120,一个研究人口的专家探讨过,00:34:17.420,00:34:22.940,I had a discussion with an expert who studies population.
00:34:23.280,00:34:24.800,她还比较乐观,00:34:23.220,00:34:24.800,He was relatively optimistic.
00:34:25.520,00:34:27.360,老龄化本身,,,
00:34:27.400,00:34:29.000,零也是一个叫银发产业,00:34:24.800,00:34:30.460,"Aging will grow the ""silver hair industry"",
which is a huge opportunity."
00:34:29.040,00:34:31.160,一个巨大的机遇,,,
00:34:31.160,00:34:32.200,第二他说,,,
00:34:32.240,00:34:32.800,是,00:34:31.280,00:34:34.420,He also suggested something that our female friends would disagree.
00:34:33.040,00:34:34.440,我们女同胞不一定同意他,,,
00:34:34.480,00:34:36.520,我们妇女退休年龄太低了,00:34:34.420,00:34:38.160,"He suggested the retirement age for
women was low and should be raised."
00:34:36.680,00:34:37.680,应该提高一点,,,
00:34:37.720,00:34:38.600,点,,,
00:34:38.640,00:34:39.840,你的意思是让我们再把,00:34:38.620,00:34:40.860,So I'd  have to retire later?
00:34:41.040,00:34:41.200,对,,,
00:34:41.200,00:34:42.200,不过我觉得,,,
00:34:42.200,00:34:43.760,张教授刚才谈的那个问题,00:34:41.200,00:34:44.320,But I'm not that concerned about this issue.
00:34:43.760,00:34:44.880,我倒不怎么担心,,,
00:34:45.000,00:34:46.560,比如生孩子这个问题,,,
00:34:46.720,00:34:47.320,因为什么,,,
00:34:47.360,00:34:48.800,我发现我们国家生产的,,,
00:34:48.840,00:34:50.480,很多的这种电视剧里面,00:34:44.320,00:34:55.180,"About having children, the ever constant topic in many
Chinese TV series is the relationship between mother and wife."
00:34:50.480,00:34:52.280,基本上这是一个主流的话题,,,
00:34:52.320,00:34:54.240,就是婆婆和媳妇之间的,,,
00:34:54.280,00:34:55.880,经久不衰的话题,,,
00:34:55.880,00:34:56.760,怀上了没有,,,
00:34:56.800,00:34:57.360,什么时候生,,,
00:34:57.360,00:34:58.240,为什么怀,00:34:55.660,00:34:59.940,"""Are you pregnant?""
""Why don't you want a child?""
""Why are you still not pregnant?"""
00:34:58.280,00:34:59.520,为什么还怀不上,,,
00:34:59.520,00:35:00.040,对不对,,,
00:35:00.080,00:35:01.000,然后一开始我们觉得,,,
00:35:01.000,00:35:02.400,这种都市的情感剧,00:35:00.160,00:35:04.040,"I thought urban-based dramas are about a
man's mother, wife, and sister"
00:35:02.400,00:35:03.120,婆婆媳妇,,,
00:35:03.120,00:35:04.040,小姑子去,,,
00:35:04.040,00:35:05.360,可能是不是只有我们中国人,,,
00:35:05.400,00:35:06.440,自己来看皮儿回来,00:35:04.260,00:35:06.680,were probably only popular with the Chinese people.
00:35:06.440,00:35:08.000,后来发现不是,00:35:06.680,00:35:08.200,That didn't turn out to be true.
00:35:08.040,00:35:10.480,所以说像金太狼的幸福生活,00:35:08.200,00:35:11.500,"We Love You, Mr. Jin was translated into Burmese."
00:35:10.560,00:35:11.600,翻译成缅甸语,,,
00:35:11.720,00:35:12.800,然后媳妇的美好时代,00:35:11.820,00:35:13.620,A Beautiful Daughter-in-law Era was translated into more languages.
00:35:12.840,00:35:13.440,更多了,,,
00:35:14.280,00:35:14.880,习近平主席,,,
00:35:14.880,00:35:16.000,在访问非洲的时候,00:35:13.620,00:35:17.560,President Xi Jinping even talked about it when he visited Africa
00:35:16.000,00:35:16.920,专门谈到,,,
00:35:17.200,00:35:18.480,因为在东非的几个国家,,,
00:35:18.480,00:35:21.040,坦桑尼亚尼亚非常的火,00:35:17.560,00:35:20.920,because it was so popular in East Africa.
00:35:21.280,00:35:22.400,但是这个人,,,
00:35:22.520,00:35:23.080,口问题,,,
00:35:23.080,00:35:24.040,我们确实要,00:35:21.300,00:35:25.160,"However, I think we really need to pay
more attention to the population problem."
00:35:24.080,00:35:25.040,要关注,,,
00:35:25.160,00:35:25.560,了,,,
00:35:25.600,00:35:28.120,现在出生率太低了,00:35:25.580,00:35:28.000,The birth rate is very low now.
00:35:28.600,00:35:29.640,所以我是觉得,,,
00:35:29.640,00:35:31.200,真的通过这个场合,00:35:28.680,00:35:33.260,"I'd like to take this opportunity to call on the government
to further open up the restrictions."
00:35:31.200,00:35:33.560,呼吁我们政府更放开一点,,,
00:35:34.280,00:35:35.440,生几个都,00:35:34.100,00:35:36.180,Have however many you want.
00:35:35.480,00:35:36.440,没事是吧,,,
00:35:36.920,00:35:37.120,对,,,
00:35:37.120,00:35:40.080,第二是不要二胎全部放开,00:35:36.180,00:35:39.660,"Yes, not the two-children policy.
As many as you want."
00:35:40.200,00:35:43.600,而且要对采取一些鼓励措施,00:35:40.060,00:35:43.240,And we need to take some incentives.
00:35:43.640,00:35:45.680,我想补充问这个位朋友,00:35:43.680,00:35:46.840,"I'd like to ask this friend, do you have a child?"
00:35:45.880,00:35:46.800,你有孩子吗,,,
00:35:47.600,00:35:48.520,我有孩子,00:35:47.680,00:35:48.420,I do.
00:35:48.520,00:35:49.720,您生二胎吗,00:35:48.520,00:35:50.100,Will you have a second child?
00:35:50.680,00:35:51.760,要考虑一下,00:35:50.100,00:35:52.100,I have to think about it.
00:35:51.800,00:35:52.840,我是鼓励你生,,,
00:35:52.840,00:35:53.240,第2个,,,
00:35:53.240,00:35:53.840,第3个,00:35:52.480,00:35:54.160,I encourage you to have a second child and a third child.
00:35:54.160,00:35:54.600,在我们,,,
00:35:55.200,00:35:55.800,一个孩子,,,
00:35:56.080,00:35:57.120,那都是,,,
00:35:57.520,00:35:59.600,过多的关注溺爱,00:35:54.160,00:36:00.920,"When we only have one child, we pay too much
attention to them and pressure on them."
00:35:59.600,00:36:00.120,然后,,,
00:36:00.160,00:36:01.520,给他压力太大,,,
00:36:01.720,00:36:02.680,我们小时候长大,,,
00:36:02.680,00:36:03.520,都是放羊式,00:36:01.580,00:36:04.520,"Our generation was raised like the ""free range lambs""."
00:36:03.560,00:36:04.920,长大也挺好的,,,
00:36:04.920,00:36:06.560,只有成功概率一样的,00:36:05.220,00:36:07.220,"The probability of success is the same, I'm telling you."
00:36:06.560,00:36:06.920,我跟你是,,,
00:36:07.080,00:36:07.640,您,,,
00:36:07.840,00:36:08.680,上扬我们,00:36:07.220,00:36:09.000,"How many ""lambs"" did you parents have?"
00:36:08.720,00:36:09.560,兄弟6,00:36:09.000,00:36:11.000,"- Six including myself.
- Six!"
00:36:11.000,00:36:11.320,对,,,
00:36:11.720,00:36:13.760,大家庭您排行老几,00:36:11.420,00:36:12.840,A big family. That's nice.
,,,00:36:12.840,00:36:15.120,"- Where do you come in your family?
- The sixth."
00:36:15.720,00:36:16.560,我们再问下去,00:36:15.120,00:36:17.440,We have to stop asking him personal questions.
00:36:16.560,00:36:17.840,什么都问出来了了,,,
00:36:17.880,00:36:18.880,好不过赵老师,,,
00:36:18.880,00:36:20.560,我还是要回到刚才这个提问,00:36:17.840,00:36:20.560,"Professor Zhang, moving back to the question."
00:36:20.560,00:36:22.520,因为刚才这位朋友问了两个问题,00:36:20.560,00:36:22.620,Our friend asked 2 questions actually.
00:36:22.520,00:36:25.200,一个是GDP的增速放缓了,00:36:22.620,00:36:25.440,The other one is the decline in the GDP growth rate.
00:36:25.200,00:36:26.080,您怎么看,,,
00:36:26.280,00:36:29.840,这个放缓是首先它有个大的趋势,00:36:26.160,00:36:29.120,It is a trend for the GDP growth rate to slow down
00:36:29.840,00:36:30.760,因为中国经济规模,,,
00:36:30.760,00:36:32.120,现在已经非常大了,00:36:29.740,00:36:32.500,because the size of China’s economy is now very large.
00:36:34.120,00:36:35.080,我如果,,,
00:36:35.120,00:36:36.800,没有计算错的话,,,
00:36:36.800,00:36:41.800,大致上现在中国仅就现在以6.,00:36:34.100,00:36:44.520,"If I did not calculate wrong, if China’s GDP growth rate
remains at 6.5% — the current level,"
00:36:41.800,00:36:41.960,5,,,
00:36:41.960,00:36:42.920,6.5%的,,,
00:36:42.920,00:36:45.200,GDP的增速为例的话,,,
00:36:45.560,00:36:48.560,大概是三年创造一个ing的,00:36:45.480,00:36:49.080,we create the GDP of the UK every three years.
00:36:48.560,00:36:51.800,GDPI经济规模已经很大,,,
00:36:51.800,00:36:53.280,这么大的规模之后,00:36:50.220,00:36:55.740,"With such a big economy, we can let it slow down naturally"
00:36:53.720,00:36:54.560,我们,,,
00:36:54.600,00:36:56.600,让他速度自然而然的慢一点,,,
00:36:56.600,00:36:57.800,然后在这慢的过程中,,,
00:36:57.800,00:36:59.480,我们进行经济结构的,00:36:56.340,00:37:00.060,and adjust the economic structure.
00:37:00.520,00:37:01.400,还是有解的,,,
00:37:01.400,00:37:02.960,但是我们必须采取措施,00:37:00.320,00:37:02.480,"There is a solution, but we must take measures."
00:37:02.960,00:37:04.000,对有解,,,
00:37:04.040,00:37:05.600,有解要采取措施,00:37:02.960,00:37:05.295,Solvable but action required.
00:37:05.600,00:37:05.760,好,,,
00:37:05.760,00:37:06.800,我们接下来再来看,,,
00:37:06.800,00:37:08.280,有没有朋友要提问,00:37:05.620,00:37:08.400,"Okay, anyone else?"
00:37:09.160,00:37:09.480,欢迎,,,
00:37:09.480,00:37:10.800,我想提一个,00:37:08.820,00:37:10.240,Yes.
00:37:10.800,00:37:11.160,关于,,,
00:37:12.080,00:37:14.000,中国基层治理的问题,00:37:10.400,00:37:14.080, I have a question about China's grassroots governance.
00:37:14.320,00:37:16.880,我本身是出生于农村,00:37:14.080,00:37:16.920,I was born in a rural area
00:37:16.880,00:37:19.440,所以我对中国基层治理,,,
00:37:19.440,00:37:20.960,存在着形式主义,00:37:16.920,00:37:23.340,"so I have experienced a lot of formalism and
bureaucracy in the grassroots governance."
00:37:20.960,00:37:22.600,和官僚主义问题,,,
00:37:22.880,00:37:23.920,感同身受,,,
00:37:24.000,00:37:25.920,我们是不是能够尝试,,,
00:37:25.920,00:37:28.240,用群众投票打分的方式,00:37:24.000,00:37:28.560,Can we adopt a voting and scoring system
00:37:28.240,00:37:29.680,来部分取代,,,
00:37:30.040,00:37:32.560,频繁的上级对下级的,00:37:28.560,00:37:36.200,to partially replace the frequent top-down inspections and assessments?
00:37:32.600,00:37:34.800,这种基层的检查考核,,,
00:37:34.920,00:37:35.480,和,,,
00:37:35.520,00:37:36.320,这样的方式,,,
00:37:36.360,00:37:37.800,我不知道张教授,,,
00:37:37.800,00:37:39.080,怎么看待这个问题,00:37:36.460,00:37:40.900,"Professor Zhang, what's your opinion on this?
What are the difficulties in its implementation?"
00:37:39.080,00:37:40.680,他实行的难点,,,
00:37:40.720,00:37:41.280,在哪,,,
00:37:42.240,00:37:42.920,不同观点,,,

00:38:55.800,00:38:57.040,怎么看待这个问题,00:38:53.660,00:38:58.660,"Professor Zhang, what's your opinion on this?
What are the difficulties in its implementation?"
00:38:57.080,00:38:59.400,他实行的难点在哪,,,
00:38:59.440,00:39:00.440,您平时生活中,00:38:59.080,00:39:01.620,Did you observe this in your daily life?
00:39:00.480,00:39:01.760,是有这方面的观察吗,,,
00:39:01.800,00:39:02.840,您所在的家乡,,,
00:39:02.840,00:39:05.640,是经常有上级要来督导,00:39:01.620,00:39:04.820,"Were there frequent inspections from the
upper governments to your hometown?"
00:39:05.680,00:39:08.080,我记得在网上看到说,,,
00:39:08.120,00:39:09.880,半月谈说中国,00:39:05.320,00:39:11.560,"I saw on banyuetan.org that there is a lot of
anomalies  in China's grassroots governance."
00:39:09.920,00:39:11.840,基层治理的有很大乱象,,,
00:39:11.840,00:39:13.200,其中有一个乱象就是说,,,
00:39:14.280,00:39:18.840,上级对下级监督检查过于频繁,00:39:11.820,00:39:18.660,One of them is the top-down inspections being too frequent.
00:39:18.880,00:39:21.640,有时候一天来了好几拨,00:39:18.660,00:39:21.900,They might even receive a few groups of inspectors a day.
00:39:21.640,00:39:24.320,都频繁去应付这种上级的检查,00:39:22.080,00:39:24.460,They have to deal with one after another.
00:39:24.360,00:39:24.800,而且,,,
00:39:24.840,00:39:25.520,工作没法做,00:39:24.460,00:39:26.260,Their actual work cannot get done.
00:39:25.560,00:39:25.680,对,,,
00:39:25.680,00:39:27.440,而且流于形式,00:39:26.260,00:39:28.180,"Yes, and they make inspections just as a matter of form."
00:39:27.480,00:39:27.880,对,,,
00:39:28.200,00:39:31.480,能不能我们党说要依靠群众,00:39:28.180,00:39:33.140,"The Communist Party said we must
rely on the masses and mobilize the masses."
00:39:31.480,00:39:32.160,发动群众,,,
00:39:32.160,00:39:34.400,能不能发挥我们群中这样的力量,00:39:33.140,00:39:34.580,Can we bring out the power of the people?
00:39:34.520,00:39:35.760,好让群众打分,00:39:34.580,00:39:36.040,Let the people score [the officials].
00:39:35.760,00:39:36.160,对吧,,,
00:39:36.200,00:39:37.840,实际上习主席我的研究,,,
00:39:37.840,00:39:39.680,它一个重要的考虑就是,00:39:36.220,00:39:39.660,"From my research, an important consideration of President Xi is to"
00:39:39.880,00:39:42.880,把基层组织重新原来太涣散了,00:39:39.800,00:39:44.460,"re-organize the grassroots organizations,
which have become too slack."
00:39:42.880,00:39:44.480,想把它重新组织起来,,,
00:39:44.520,00:39:45.800,然后服务基层,00:39:44.460,00:39:46.380,So they can better serve the grassroots communities.
00:39:47.640,00:39:48.520,但你讲这个现象,,,
00:39:48.560,00:39:49.800,现在开始出现了,00:39:46.620,00:39:52.380,"But the phenomenon of formality that
you mentioned has been emerging."
00:39:49.840,00:39:52.000,就是形式主义,,,
00:39:52.080,00:39:52.080,一,,,
00:39:53.400,00:39:54.640,各种各样任务压下来,,,
00:39:54.680,00:39:55.760,要填各种各样,00:39:53.000,00:39:56.360,"Various tasks are pressed down,
and various forms are to be filled."
00:39:55.800,00:39:56.360,格,,,
00:39:56.400,00:39:57.280,然后变成,,,
00:39:58.120,00:40:00.840,给基层上面千根线下边一根针,00:39:56.440,00:40:01.360,"A grassroots government is like
""a needle under a thousand threads""."
00:40:02.360,00:40:03.480,压力非常之大,00:40:01.780,00:40:03.860,They are under a lot of stress.
00:40:03.480,00:40:04.040,所以这个问题,,,
00:40:04.040,00:40:05.320,我觉得需要解决的,00:40:03.860,00:40:05.380,This problem needs to be solved.
00:40:05.400,00:40:06.560,实际上中国,,,
00:40:06.560,00:40:07.160,我觉得,,,
00:40:07.160,00:40:08.960,可以充分的利用自己,00:40:05.500,00:40:10.680,"In fact, I think we can make full use of our traditional resources."
00:40:09.000,00:40:09.520,的,,,
00:40:09.560,00:40:11.240,一个是传统资源,,,
00:40:11.360,00:40:13.680,我调查过一些山东的农村,00:40:11.440,00:40:13.600,I surveyed some rural areas in Shandong Province.
00:40:13.680,00:40:16.000,他们实际上还是具体的名字,00:40:13.600,00:40:16.220,They actually still... I forgot their names.
00:40:16.000,00:40:16.520,我忘了,,,
00:40:17.400,00:40:20.080,类似像老人协会这种形式,00:40:16.220,00:40:19.760,"They still have ""associations of seniors"" or something similar"
00:40:20.120,00:40:21.520,就是年,,,
00:40:21.520,00:40:23.840,就像跟我们过去传统乡绅,00:40:20.380,00:40:24.540,which are like our historical village governors.
00:40:23.880,00:40:25.160,有点像,,,
00:40:26.040,00:40:27.840,村庄里边比较受人尊重,,,
00:40:27.880,00:40:27.920,的,,,
00:40:29.000,00:40:30.880,德高望重的老年人,00:40:25.080,00:40:32.520,"The well-respected seniors in the village
form an organization to resolve conflicts."
00:40:30.960,00:40:32.040,把他们组织起来,,,
00:40:32.040,00:40:33.240,解决一些矛盾,,,
00:40:33.240,00:40:34.120,德高望重,,,
00:40:34.160,00:40:35.880,老人很多问题处理的时候,00:40:33.420,00:40:36.700,They are no worse than the courts in handling many problems.
00:40:35.920,00:40:37.040,不比法院差,,,
00:40:37.040,00:40:38.000,这是一个例子,00:40:37.040,00:40:38.840,That's an example I can think of.
00:40:38.040,00:40:39.680,实际上我们基层很多发明,00:40:38.840,00:40:40.360,We have many inventions at the grass-roots level.
00:40:39.680,00:40:40.400,我了解,,,
00:40:40.400,00:40:41.040,比方说合掌,00:40:40.360,00:40:41.960,"For example, the River Chief System."
00:40:41.920,00:40:42.720,就每一条,,,
00:40:42.760,00:40:43.680,和到任何,,,
00:40:43.720,00:40:45.680,地方都是定位到人,00:40:41.960,00:40:45.800,A person is responsible for the a section of a river.
00:40:45.720,00:40:48.200,你要管好现在这个环境治理,00:40:45.800,00:40:49.440,This is an important regulation in environmental management
00:40:48.200,00:40:49.360,这是很重要的一条,,,
00:40:49.360,00:40:49.480,吴,,,
00:40:49.640,00:40:51.680,基层首创的一个经验,00:40:49.440,00:40:52.200,that was pioneered at the grassroots level.
00:40:51.680,00:40:52.880,现在推广,,,
00:40:53.040,00:40:55.000,所以有你讲的这种例子,,,
00:40:55.040,00:40:57.200,就是继承形式主义,00:40:53.060,00:40:57.020,There is the grassroots formalism that you mentioned.
00:40:57.240,00:40:59.280,同时也有一些好的例子,00:40:57.020,00:40:59.060,And there are also good examples at the grassroots level.
00:40:59.280,00:41:00.640,其实中国精彩的地方,00:40:59.080,00:41:00.780,That's what's interesting about China.
00:41:00.640,00:41:01.320,就是他一方面,,,
00:41:01.320,00:41:02.200,很多问题方面,00:41:00.780,00:41:02.800,We have so many problems on the one hand.
00:41:02.200,00:41:02.720,解决问题,,,
00:41:02.760,00:41:04.360,办法也在不停的出来,00:41:02.800,00:41:04.800,"And on the other hand, we are coming up with different solutions."
00:41:04.360,00:41:05.920,不过你讲的我觉得非常好,00:41:04.920,00:41:06.880,And I like the solution you suggested a lot.
00:41:05.920,00:41:06.360,就通过,,,
00:41:06.400,00:41:06.840,过,,,
00:41:06.880,00:41:08.520,反向不是上边来,00:41:06.880,00:41:10.100,"Instead of top-down inspections,"
00:41:09.400,00:41:10.080,检查,,,
00:41:10.120,00:41:10.400,而,,,
00:41:10.440,00:41:11.920,亚边的通过民调,00:41:10.100,00:41:13.880,we can take a bottom-up approach such as opinion polls.
00:41:12.200,00:41:14.040,这些方法来了解,,,
00:41:14.040,00:41:14.480,这,,,
00:41:14.480,00:41:15.320,你可以买一个服务,,,
00:41:15.480,00:41:16.880,请一个比较好的公司,00:41:14.400,00:41:19.280,We can purchase a third-party service to do that.
00:41:16.880,00:41:19.400,去做第三方来去做民调,,,
00:41:19.400,00:41:20.680,干部做得怎么样,,,
00:41:20.800,00:41:22.080,一下效果就出来了,00:41:19.440,00:41:22.260,We can immediately see how the officials perform.
00:41:22.080,00:41:22.440,对,,,
00:41:22.880,00:41:24.360,也希望这样的一个提问,,,
00:41:24.400,00:41:26.040,能够被更多的人了解到,00:41:22.940,00:41:28.000,I hope more people will hear about your suggestion and adopt it.
00:41:26.080,00:41:27.480,也许就这个建议,,,
00:41:27.520,00:41:28.880,就会被人采纳,,,
00:41:28.920,00:41:29.040,好,,,
00:41:29.080,00:41:30.120,我们谢谢这位朋友,00:41:28.820,00:41:31.140,Thanks for the question. Anything you want to add?
00:41:30.120,00:41:30.720,还有补充吗,,,
00:41:31.880,00:41:34.080,我记得张教授经常说,00:41:31.420,00:41:34.280,I remember Professor Zhang often said that
00:41:34.360,00:41:35.520,我们国家的,,,
00:41:36.240,00:41:37.640,选拔加选举的制度,00:41:34.280,00:41:40.360,"China's selection-election system is better
than the western election-only system."
00:41:37.720,00:41:39.440,要比西方的这种,,,
00:41:39.480,00:41:40.880,单单选举的制度和好,,,
00:41:40.880,00:41:41.920,我想,,,
00:41:41.960,00:41:43.600,但是我现在就发现,,,
00:41:43.960,00:41:45.840,实际上我们的选拔加选举,00:41:40.780,00:41:49.000,"But I find that in our selection-election system,
the masses have not been fully mobilized."
00:41:45.840,00:41:46.800,就群众的力量,,,
00:41:46.800,00:41:49.000,没有完全充分的调动出来,,,
00:41:49.760,00:41:51.960,我想如果能把群众的力量,00:41:49.780,00:41:54.120,"Mobilizing the masses will ""add wings to a tiger""."
00:41:51.960,00:41:52.920,能调动出来,,,
00:41:52.920,00:41:54.520,可以说是如虎添翼,,,
00:41:54.560,00:41:56.800,让我们的这种官员的任免,00:41:54.200,00:41:59.320,"It will improve the systems such as
official appointments and dismissals."
00:41:56.840,00:41:57.320,等等,,,
00:41:57.320,00:41:58.400,这种体制,,,
00:41:58.560,00:41:59.560,更加完善,,,
00:41:59.840,00:42:01.800,这个就是难点在什么地方,,,
00:42:01.960,00:42:06.960,就怎么动员群众来参加选拔加,00:42:00.000,00:42:07.540,"The difficulty lies in how to mobilize
the masses to participate in selection and election."
00:42:06.960,00:42:07.720,选举,,,
00:42:08.720,00:42:09.280,是我,,,
00:42:09.320,00:42:09.920,的,,,
00:42:09.960,00:42:11.000,也有试点,00:42:08.480,00:42:13.460,There are also pilots and many successful cases.
00:42:11.000,00:42:13.120,也有非常很多成功的案例,,,
00:42:13.960,00:42:15.400,一般选拔的过程中,,,
00:42:15.400,00:42:18.400,你进行某种形式的民调,00:42:13.840,00:42:17.760,"For example, some forms of opinion polls were
conducted during the selection process."
00:42:18.600,00:42:19.840,而且一般的做法怎么样,,,
00:42:20.000,00:42:21.520,就是得分最高的,00:42:18.500,00:42:22.240,The general practice is not always to select the top scorer.
00:42:21.520,00:42:22.560,不一定能选上,,,
00:42:22.560,00:42:23.760,因为你可能是老好人,00:42:22.240,00:42:25.100,"They might just be trying to please
everyone but not doing a lot of work."
00:42:23.760,00:42:24.880,实际上不能做事儿,,,
00:42:25.600,00:42:27.000,最差的肯定是out,00:42:25.540,00:42:28.280,The low scorers will definitely be out.
00:42:27.360,00:42:28.080,你就要出去了,,,
00:42:28.400,00:42:29.560,可能是,00:42:28.320,00:42:31.100,We might be selecting from a layer.
00:42:30.720,00:42:31.240,某一个层,,,
00:42:31.440,00:42:33.520,我觉得作为至少是一个,,,
00:42:33.560,00:42:35.760,选拔重要的参考系数,00:42:31.100,00:42:36.880,"It's important that we have this as a
factor for reference in the selection."
00:42:35.760,00:42:37.040,我觉得这个非常重要,,,
00:42:37.480,00:42:40.160,所以就把你建议给容纳进来,00:42:37.700,00:42:40.020,That will incorporate your suggestion into the system.
00:42:41.560,00:42:41.760,好,,,
00:42:41.760,00:42:42.920,谢谢这位提问者,00:42:41.200,00:42:43.240,"- Thank you, Professor.
- Thank you for the question."
00:42:43.120,00:42:45.600,也想跟张老师交流一下,00:42:43.240,00:42:46.820,I'd also like to ask Prof. Zhang.
00:42:45.600,00:42:47.280,您看您这一集的主题是,,,
00:42:47.280,00:42:48.720,一出国就爱国,00:42:46.820,00:42:48.680,"The topic of this episode is ""go abroad and love China more."""
00:42:48.760,00:42:50.920,我们虽然我们有一些朋友的提问,,,
00:42:51.080,00:42:53.880,确实是从远处来回看中国,00:42:48.680,00:42:53.440,"Some of our friends asked their questions
looking at China from a distance."
00:42:53.880,00:42:56.080,但是你看刚才提基层治理的这位,,,
00:42:56.080,00:42:56.400,朋友,00:42:53.940,00:42:58.740,But the last question was about grassroots China.
00:42:56.400,00:42:57.520,他也是扎根中国,,,
00:42:57.520,00:42:58.960,来关注中国的问题,,,
00:42:59.480,00:43:00.600,您觉得观察中国,,,
00:43:00.640,00:43:01.920,既要看静静,00:42:59.540,00:43:02.860,"We need both a close-up and a long shot
when we observe China, don't we?"
00:43:01.920,00:43:02.840,也要看远景,,,
00:43:02.840,00:43:03.120,对吧,,,
00:43:03.680,00:43:04.160,对,00:43:02.860,00:43:04.160,We do.
00:43:04.720,00:43:07.520,我特别相信邓小平,00:43:04.360,00:43:08.420,"I really believe what Deng Xiaoping siad,"
00:43:07.520,00:43:08.560,讲过这么一句话,,,
00:43:08.560,00:43:09.800,我是亲耳听他,00:43:08.480,00:43:10.480,"I heard him saying this personally,"
00:43:10.000,00:43:10.440,说的,,,
00:43:10.440,00:43:13.120,就是一个听过枪声的士兵,00:43:10.480,00:43:15.700,"""A soldier who has heard gunfire is completely
different from a soldier who has not."""
00:43:13.160,00:43:14.920,和没有听过枪声的士兵,,,
00:43:14.920,00:43:16.280,是完全不一样,,,
00:43:17.440,00:43:18.760,读完女书行万里路,00:43:17.200,00:43:20.300,"""Read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles.""
[from an essay by Dong Qichang, Ming Dynasty]"
00:43:18.760,00:43:20.320,一定要实地的调研,,,
00:43:21.120,00:43:22.280,这样你才能够叫做,,,
00:43:22.280,00:43:24.320,用脚底板走出来的学问,00:43:21.080,00:43:24.060,"That's how we ""acquire knowledge with our feet""."
00:43:24.600,00:43:26.720,归根到底是实事求是,00:43:24.320,00:43:26.720,"Ultimately, this is ""seeking truth from facts""."
00:43:26.920,00:43:28.360,我觉得这个是非常好,,,
00:43:28.360,00:43:29.680,中国人这一套做法,,,
00:43:29.680,00:43:31.160,无论是做学问,00:43:26.940,00:43:35.300,"This is good practice for gaining knowledge, for
political research, and for decision making."
00:43:31.240,00:43:32.960,还是做政策研究,,,
00:43:32.960,00:43:34.400,还是做决策,,,
00:43:34.840,00:43:35.720,都非常好,,,
00:43:35.920,00:43:37.360,宏观的和微观的,00:43:35.800,00:43:38.380,Combine the macro and the micro.
00:43:37.360,00:43:38.520,两个结合起来,,,
00:43:39.000,00:43:40.760,过去毛主席上解剖一个麻雀,00:43:38.960,00:43:41.180,"Chairman Mao said ""a typical survey is like dissecting a sparrow""."
00:43:41.680,00:43:42.680,陈云讲,,,
00:43:42.680,00:43:44.680,我回到我老家开个座谈会,00:43:41.400,00:43:44.415,I attended a forum in my hometown.
00:43:44.680,00:43:45.760,是我的老朋友,,,
00:43:45.760,00:43:46.440,相亲,00:43:44.780,00:43:47.840,My old friends and the village folks would not lie to me.
00:43:46.480,00:43:47.880,不会跟我说谎话的,,,
00:43:48.400,00:43:50.400,这些实际上都是很有道理,00:43:48.340,00:43:50.755,All these maxims make sense.
00:43:50.520,00:43:51.000,是,,,
00:43:51.120,00:43:53.520,就像我们睁开眼睛出国去看世界,00:43:51.180,00:43:53.560,"Whether we open our eyes and go abroad to see the world,"
00:43:53.520,00:43:55.400,就像我们这位关注基层治理的,00:43:53.560,00:43:55.920,"or look at grassroots governance at home,"
00:43:55.400,00:43:55.760,朋友,,,
00:43:55.760,00:43:58.200,其实都是在通过观察,,,
00:43:58.240,00:43:59.800,认真的想要读懂中国,00:43:56.200,00:44:00.620,"we are trying to learn about China
and understand China through our observations."
00:43:59.800,00:44:00.840,了解中国,,,
00:44:01.120,00:44:02.760,我们这一期节目到这就结束了,,,
00:44:02.760,00:44:04.960,我们掌声再一次的送给张老师,00:44:00.900,00:44:04.760,"This is the end of this episode.
Let's give another round of applause for Prof. Zhang."
