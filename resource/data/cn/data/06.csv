00:00:06.031,00:00:09.180,他不会跟着其他国家亦步亦趋,00:00:06.680,00:00:09.120,so it will not follow every step of other countries.
00:00:09.181,00:00:10.920,没有时候一项国际接轨,00:00:09.120,00:00:12.300,"In some cases, people will lose their own features in internationalization."
00:00:10.921,00:00:12.360,国际化就把自己给忘了,,,
00:00:12.361,00:00:14.940,在这个改革的道路上就哪些能干,00:00:12.340,00:00:15.460,"On the road to reform, what can we change and what should we hold up to?"
00:00:14.941,00:00:16.110,哪些就不能改,,,
00:00:16.111,00:00:19.890,中国特色社会主义制度吸取了哪些有益的一些养分,00:00:15.760,00:00:19.780,What positive experience did our present Socialist System with Chinese Characteristics absorb?
00:00:19.891,00:00:21.870,要建立制度认同,00:00:19.780,00:00:23.320,Institutional acceptance must no longer be a vague concept. It must be established.
00:00:21.871,00:00:23.670,不能再真的云里雾里的,,,
00:00:23.671,00:00:26.730,这就是中国青张尾数,00:00:23.500,00:00:26.800,China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:00:31.800,00:00:37.440,弹幕真的是一个特别好的设计等下阶段红色的那个名字,00:00:34.580,00:00:36.120,Look at this comment.
,,,00:00:36.360,00:00:39.100,"- The one in red?
- Yes."
00:00:37.441,00:00:41.130,那个这个每个国家形成的历史环境人群都不同,00:00:39.100,00:00:42.195,"""Every country is built upon a different history, environment, and people,"
00:00:41.131,00:00:44.880,自然会有每个国家自己的道路,00:00:42.195,00:00:44.275,"""so naturally, every country has its unique path of development."
00:00:44.881,00:00:48.150,美国和英国的命中速度还拍不一样的发展道路也不同,00:00:44.665,00:00:47.825,"""Even the democracies in the US and the UK are different from each other,"
,,,00:00:47.825,00:00:49.605,"""and they take different paths as well,"
00:00:48.151,00:00:51.840,凭什么他们要质疑中国独有的模式和制度的这个,00:00:49.605,00:00:51.400,"""so why can't they tolerate a different Chinese path?"""
00:00:51.841,00:00:55.710,其实我们这几个媒体人经常碰到西方媒体,00:00:51.400,00:00:55.545,"Working in media, we always meet people working in Western media."
00:00:55.711,00:00:57.270,三个都在国外呆过,00:00:55.545,00:00:57.000,We have all been abroad.
00:00:57.271,00:00:58.410,我觉得就是那种,00:00:57.000,00:00:59.800,"In my opinion, they just think you are different from them."
00:00:58.411,00:01:00.090,他就认为你跟他不一样,,,
00:01:00.091,00:01:02.370,因为你不是西式民主国家,00:00:59.800,00:01:04.300,You don't adopt western democracy in the form of its political and social systems.
00:01:02.371,00:01:04.620,从政治制度上你的社会制度上,,,
00:01:04.621,00:01:06.960,所以你做的一切都是坏,00:01:04.300,00:01:06.000,"So, you are wrong in everything."
00:01:06.961,00:01:09.030,一切都是不好的,00:01:06.765,00:01:08.045,Everything is bad.
00:01:09.031,00:01:11.070,2004年,,,
00:01:11.071,00:01:15.270,当时英国独立电视台ITV一的一个制片人是个主播,00:01:08.675,00:01:17.000,"In 2004, a producer and a host of ITV flew to Beijing on October 1st."
00:01:15.271,00:01:16.350,10月1号,,,
00:01:16.351,00:01:17.220,然后他被他逮住了,,,
00:01:17.221,00:01:18.360,我声音正好,00:01:17.000,00:01:19.400,"I invited her: ""Let's go to visit the Forbidden City."""
00:01:18.361,00:01:20.160,我带你去看故宫,,,
00:01:20.161,00:01:23.190,然后大家知道十一的不同的是什么样的,00:01:20.055,00:01:23.400,You all know the Forbidden City on October 1st each year. [the National Day holiday]
00:01:23.191,00:01:26.760,因为天安门东天安门西地铁站是不开的,00:01:23.400,00:01:26.400,"The two subway stations ""Tiananmen East"" and ""Tiananmen West"" are closed."
00:01:26.761,00:01:28.590,你只能在西单下车,00:01:26.400,00:01:28.345,You have to get off at the Xidan station.
00:01:28.591,00:01:29.520,西单下来呢,,,
00:01:29.521,00:01:32.670,想跟着人潮就是你根本不是他自己走的,00:01:28.345,00:01:31.585,"Then, you follow the crowd."
00:01:32.671,00:01:34.860,你是被人流推着他的,00:01:31.585,00:01:34.600,The huge crowd will push you to go forward.
00:01:34.861,00:01:39.930,然后这个女制片人这个依恋就从头到尾说,00:01:34.600,00:01:41.500,"So, all along the way, she kept saying: ""Oh, my gosh!"" ""Oh, my goodness!"""
00:01:39.931,00:01:43.560,然后买东西哦哦,,,
00:01:43.561,00:01:45.090,爱丽丝已经是X呆着,00:01:42.005,00:01:45.485,"""Oh, my goodness! So, everything is understandable!"""
00:01:45.091,00:01:47.160,不就从人口的这个角度,,,
00:01:47.161,00:01:49.920,他们可能面对的体谅就是几千万的,00:01:45.575,00:01:49.400,"In terms of population, the West faces only tens of millions of people in one country."
00:01:49.921,00:01:54.990,所以他很难理解你这十几个亿的人口会带来什么阶段性的问题,00:01:49.400,00:01:54.400,"So, they may struggle to imagine periodical problems
brought by a population of more than one billion."
00:01:54.991,00:01:59.190,所以这个缺乏体验缺乏实践的认知是特别重要的,00:01:54.765,00:01:59.800,"It's an important reason for their misunderstanding that
they lack the practical experience."
00:01:59.191,00:02:02.400,一个原因就是这背后就是那个所谓的刻板印象,00:01:59.800,00:02:02.200,Behind this is the so-called stereotypes.
00:02:02.401,00:02:04.110,我在桂林漓江去玩的时候了,,,
00:02:04.111,00:02:06.420,然后碰到一对法国夫妇,00:02:02.200,00:02:06.200,I met a French couple when I travelled in Guilin.
00:02:06.421,00:02:07.920,他们在找厕所找不见,00:02:06.240,00:02:07.920,They needed help to find the restroom.
00:02:07.921,00:02:08.400,然后呢,,,
00:02:08.401,00:02:09.270,我会点鲨鱼,00:02:07.920,00:02:10.000,"I can speak a little french. So, I went to help."
00:02:09.271,00:02:10.140,那么就帮帮他,,,
00:02:10.141,00:02:10.740,他看到我说,,,
00:02:10.741,00:02:10.980,哎呀,,,
00:02:10.981,00:02:13.170,你们这个地方风景太好了,00:02:10.000,00:02:13.000,"They told me, Guilin is a beautiful place."
00:02:13.171,00:02:15.180,然后我说爱这个字甲天下吧,00:02:13.000,00:02:15.800,"I replied, yes, indeed."
00:02:15.181,00:02:16.020,好风景,,,
00:02:16.021,00:02:16.500,他说,,,
00:02:16.501,00:02:18.570,可是我发现一个奇怪的地方,00:02:15.800,00:02:18.500,"Then, they asked me: ""But there's something unusual."
00:02:18.571,00:02:23.190,你们怎么现在没人再去看这种标语性的东西也没有,00:02:18.500,00:02:22.780,"Why are there no [political] slogans anymore and no one holds them now?"""
00:02:23.191,00:02:24.930,哪里是没啥丢人,00:02:22.780,00:02:26.120,"- No more slogans!
- They still think there would be slogans!"
00:02:24.931,00:02:26.520,以为还是一个标语的事,,,
00:02:26.521,00:02:29.970,那我怎么觉得你们现在好像都跟我们说的完全不一样,00:02:26.560,00:02:29.620,"""It's strange that China is totally different from what we have known."""
00:02:29.971,00:02:33.990,我说你是你是开传送门过来的吗,00:02:29.625,00:02:32.975,"I replied: ""Are you time travelling? 40 years have passed..."""
00:02:33.991,00:02:37.380,你这算上这个40年是怎么过的,00:02:33.095,00:02:37.700,"- They are time travellers.
- How have you spent the past 40 years?"
00:02:37.381,00:02:40.740,所以他这种刻板印象是特别要不得,00:02:37.700,00:02:40.300,These kinds of stereotypes have to be discarded.
00:02:40.741,00:02:41.970,还是了解太少,00:02:40.605,00:02:41.605,They know so little about us.
00:02:41.971,00:02:47.730,杰刚你说这个西方他这个百十年来百多年来这样的一种现代化的发展,00:02:41.715,00:02:47.500,"After the development of the past one hundred
years in the West,"
00:02:47.731,00:02:50.610,他们不仅是不了解他之外的一些地区,00:02:47.895,00:02:50.845,"they know little about other countries apart from their own,"
00:02:50.611,00:02:51.360,不光是中国,,,
00:02:51.361,00:02:53.070,其实你说他对印度的了解,,,
00:02:53.071,00:02:54.450,对其他国家的了解,00:02:50.845,00:02:57.105,"not only about China, but also others,
like India, or about the African countries"
00:02:54.451,00:02:55.590,他有那么充分了,,,
00:02:55.591,00:02:57.720,对非洲国家而且很有意思的是,,,
00:02:57.721,00:02:59.310,我们刚才说西方对我们有好处,00:02:57.105,00:03:00.300,"It's interesting that because of the Western
misinterpretations, misunderstandings and prejudices,"
00:03:00.420,00:03:03.300,偏见现在因为长期从1840年了,00:03:00.305,00:03:06.000,"we Chinese have reflected deeply on ourselves since 1840, for a long time."
00:03:03.301,00:03:04.260,我们自己反思,,,
00:03:04.261,00:03:04.710,反思,,,
00:03:04.711,00:03:05.040,反思,,,
00:03:05.041,00:03:06.780,反思到骨子里头去了,,,
00:03:06.781,00:03:08.520,最积极的人私奔到古代有趣,00:03:06.000,00:03:08.800,We have done the reflection most actively!
00:03:08.521,00:03:10.770,我们的人原来是我们这个制度不行,00:03:08.800,00:03:11.900,"They said the system was problematic.
Okay, we modified it."
00:03:10.771,00:03:11.100,对吧,,,
00:03:11.101,00:03:12.690,我们改我们文化,,,
00:03:12.691,00:03:13.380,文化不好,00:03:11.900,00:03:14.385,"Then, our culture was said to be naturally defective."
00:03:13.381,00:03:14.730,有劣根性,,,
00:03:14.731,00:03:18.630,最后连我的人种都被谁让我们有什么优势,00:03:14.485,00:03:17.305,"Finally, our race was defined as flawed."
00:03:18.631,00:03:20.220,将来会有什么样的发展,00:03:17.305,00:03:22.600,We have to construct a theory on our advantages and our future development.
00:03:20.221,00:03:22.680,这一套理论你需要自己建立起来,,,
00:03:22.681,00:03:26.700,至少你要对得起这些这么关心国家的这些年轻的,00:03:22.600,00:03:27.040,"This will be responsible for the young generations
who care about our country so much."

00:03:38.161,00:03:43.980,让我们一起在这里定位中国也读懂中国站在我身边的是我们节目的主嘉宾,00:03:38.500,00:03:41.555,We come here to position China and to understand China.

00:03:43.981,00:03:47.040,复旦大学中国研究院的院长张维为教授,00:03:44.395,00:03:46.905,He is the Director of China Institute of Fudan University.
00:03:47.041,00:03:50.670,那么今天在现场的张教授会先给出一段主旨演讲,00:03:46.905,00:03:50.700,Professor Zhang will first give today's keynote speech.
00:03:50.671,00:03:52.230,然后我们会开放提问,00:03:50.700,00:03:52.295,"Then, it will be Q&A time."
00:03:52.231,00:03:57.060,我们也期待现场的朋友们跟张维为教授思想的碰撞,00:03:52.295,00:03:56.800,We look forward to discussions between you and Professor Zhang.
00:03:57.061,00:03:57.660,那接下来呢,,,
00:03:57.661,00:03:59.550,我们先把时间留给张教授,00:03:56.800,00:04:00.000,"- Now, it's time for the Prof. Zhang.
- Thank you."
00:03:59.551,00:03:59.910,谢谢,,,
00:04:03.540,00:04:05.640,这个我那一直在想啊,,,
00:04:05.641,00:04:08.790,就是为什么西方老师都不懂中国,00:04:04.200,00:04:08.100,I am always wondering why the West cannot understand China.
00:04:08.791,00:04:12.690,我觉得一个重要的原因是他们的意识形态的偏见,00:04:08.540,00:04:12.200,"In my opinion, one important reason is their ideological prejudice."
00:04:12.691,00:04:16.320,另外还有个就是欧洲中心论的这种视角,00:04:12.280,00:04:18.000,A second reason is the perspective of eurocentrism.
00:04:16.321,00:04:18.450,所以很难读懂中国,,,
00:04:18.451,00:04:19.740,那他无法理解,00:04:18.235,00:04:22.900,They cannot imagine and understand a country
00:04:19.741,00:04:26.820,就是一个在数千年没有中断的伟大文明基础上形成的有限的国家,00:04:23.045,00:04:27.200,formed from a culture lasting for thousands of years.
00:04:27.870,00:04:29.130,那大家可能记得啊,00:04:27.645,00:04:30.435,"You may remember that in 2016,"
00:04:29.131,00:04:37.620,就是16年德国时任总统高克到上海到同济大学做了一个演讲,00:04:31.095,00:04:36.900,German president Gauck gave a speech at Tongji University in Shanghai.
00:04:37.621,00:04:40.740,那么他原来是东德的一个持不同政见者,00:04:37.385,00:04:40.575,He used to be a dissident in the German Democratic Republic.
00:04:40.741,00:04:42.000,是他在这个演讲中的,,,
00:04:42.001,00:04:43.620,就影射就是中国,00:04:40.575,00:04:44.700,He suggested in his speech that China is somewhat like East Germany.
00:04:43.621,00:04:49.770,有点像东德是让这种心态在很多西方人的心里都有,00:04:45.295,00:04:50.800,"This idea is common for many Westerners
— I have known so many."
00:04:49.771,00:04:51.600,我接触过太多了,,,
00:04:51.601,00:04:59.460,那么他们把中国看作是我真的要放大的东德B栋的打法怎么但这场颜色革命么,00:04:51.300,00:04:55.900,"They view China as an “East Germany in a larger size”,"
00:04:59.461,00:05:00.450,我经常跟他们讲,00:04:55.960,00:04:58.600,and expect a color revolution to take place in China.
00:05:00.451,00:05:03.210,我说中国和东德是很不一样的,00:04:58.945,00:05:03.000,"And I always tell them that China is quite different from East Germany,"
00:05:03.211,00:05:04.650,至少有几个差别,00:05:03.000,00:05:04.385,at least in the following aspects:
00:05:04.651,00:05:05.010,第一,,,
00:05:05.011,00:05:07.320,我说中国是高度开放的国家,00:05:04.385,00:05:07.445,"Firstly, China is a highly open country."
00:05:07.321,00:05:10.350,我们现在每年出境人只值一亿多,00:05:07.445,00:05:09.745,"Trips going abroad amount to 100 million annually,"
00:05:10.351,00:05:14.550,那么东德子非常封闭哦,00:05:10.120,00:05:13.200,while East Germany closed its borders.
00:05:14.551,00:05:16.830,而且从目前世界最大的货物贸易国,00:05:14.260,00:05:17.520,"Also, China is the world’s largest country in terms of goods trade."
00:05:18.360,00:05:18.780,第二呢,,,
00:05:18.781,00:05:26.160,就是很多西方人把这个中国大陆和台湾的关系比喻成东德和西德的关系,00:05:18.100,00:05:22.600,"Secondly, many Westerners compare the relationship
between the mainland and Taiwan"
,,,00:05:23.255,00:05:25.495,to the relationship between East Germany and West Germany.
00:05:26.161,00:05:29.850,认为台湾代表了历史发展的正确方向,00:05:25.895,00:05:29.315,"They think that Taiwan represents the future direction of development,"
00:05:29.851,00:05:32.190,他们以为大陆人羡慕台湾,00:05:29.615,00:05:31.895,and that people in the mainland envy the life in Taiwan so much
00:05:32.191,00:05:33.930,甚至会像当年那样啊,00:05:31.975,00:05:35.445,"that they may even flood into Taiwan like people in East
Germany flooding into West Germany."
00:05:33.931,00:05:37.170,东德人涌向希特勒和我就告诉他,,,
00:05:37.171,00:05:41.010,我说你一定要了解大陆与台湾关系正好相反,00:05:35.925,00:05:40.400,"So, I told him that the relationship between the mainland
and Taiwan is just the opposite."
00:05:41.011,00:05:43.140,如果一定要像一些西方人那样,00:05:40.745,00:05:44.900,"If we have to politicize everything like some Westerners do,"
00:05:43.141,00:05:45.450,把一切问题都政治化的话,,,
00:05:45.451,00:05:48.660,那么今天用脚投票的事项是台湾人,00:05:45.400,00:05:48.100,"today, it is the Taiwanese who vote with their feet."
00:05:48.661,00:05:51.570,我估计在我们这个上海或者大上海地区,00:05:48.440,00:05:54.240,"I estimate that there are about 500,000 people
from Taiwan in the greater Shanghai area."
00:05:51.571,00:05:54.390,上海周边的钱算进去大概有五十万台玩童,,,
00:05:55.710,00:05:59.130,在整个中国大陆生活工作学习的台湾同胞,00:05:55.320,00:06:00.900,And no less than 2 million Taiwanese now work or study in the mainland.
00:05:59.131,00:06:01.950,现在怎么估计都超过两百万,,,
00:06:01.951,00:06:05.580,而台湾整个人口才两千三百万第一上,00:06:01.860,00:06:05.060,"The total population of Taiwan is only 23 million, which is smaller than Shanghai’s."
00:06:05.581,00:06:06.120,所以啊,,,
00:06:06.121,00:06:07.290,这个坦率讲,,,
00:06:07.291,00:06:11.670,我们是不想把各种问题都阵子画没有多少意义,00:06:05.340,00:06:11.100,"Speaking frankly, we don’t want to politicize everything,
as some of them are meaningless."
,,,00:06:11.385,00:06:13.645,But Westerners like to do so.
00:06:11.671,00:06:16.440,但希望特别喜欢把问题这句话日久生只好奉陪,00:06:14.120,00:06:15.880,"So, we might have no other choice than to join their discussion."
00:06:16.441,00:06:21.390,那我自己这个对台湾前景做过很多预测,00:06:16.160,00:06:20.200,I have made many predictions about Taiwan’s future.
00:06:21.391,00:06:25.410,其中有一个预测就是台湾采用西方政治模式,00:06:20.815,00:06:26.600,"One of them is that Taiwanese are going from ""hope to disappointment"""
00:06:25.411,00:06:27.030,民主化之后,,,
00:06:27.031,00:06:27.900,我说,,,
00:06:27.901,00:06:30.240,从希望到失望,00:06:26.805,00:06:32.200,after they democratized under the Western political model
00:06:30.241,00:06:32.520,然后到更大的失望,,,
00:06:32.521,00:06:32.670,唉,,,
00:06:32.671,00:06:34.620,如果没有中国大陆帮助的话,00:06:32.295,00:06:35.800,and they will fall into desperation without the mainland’s help.
00:06:34.621,00:06:35.430,将到绝望,,,
00:06:36.810,00:06:38.760,我觉得过去二十多年,,,
00:06:38.761,00:06:42.000,台湾基本上是这么一个发展的大的态势,00:06:36.545,00:06:42.100,"In my eyes, this is the general trend of development
in Taiwan over the past two decades."
00:06:42.930,00:06:50.280,第三个就西方这个理解的偏差就是对中国国家我叫特制的理解,00:06:42.695,00:06:49.800,"Thirdly, the West tends to misunderstand Chinese national characteristics."
00:06:50.281,00:06:52.860,至于今天我想跟大家探讨的话题,00:06:49.985,00:06:52.345,That’s what I want to discuss with you:
00:06:52.861,00:06:54.870,就中国不是一个放大的东德,00:06:52.615,00:06:55.200,"China is not “another East Germany in a larger size”,"
00:06:55.860,00:06:58.020,不是一个普通的国家,00:06:55.585,00:06:57.145,"not a common country,"
00:06:58.021,00:07:00.450,中国是一个文明型国家,00:06:57.755,00:06:59.735,but a “civilizational state”.
00:07:00.451,00:07:03.630,所以中国的崛起也不是一个普通国家的崛起,00:07:00.155,00:07:05.400,"So, China’s rise is not the rise of a common country,
but the rise of a “civilizational state”."
00:07:03.631,00:07:05.490,而是一个文明型国家的崛起,,,
00:07:06.570,00:07:12.600,那个这个观点我正式提出来是在八年前也就是2011年的时候,00:07:06.305,00:07:12.200,"I formally proposed this idea eight years ago, in 2011,"
00:07:12.601,00:07:15.000,当时我这个出了一本书,00:07:12.365,00:07:17.500,"in my book ""China Wave - The Rise of A Civilizational State""."
00:07:15.001,00:07:15.990,叫中国震撼,,,
00:07:15.991,00:07:18.300,一个文明型国家的崛起,,,
00:07:18.301,00:07:23.190,现在大概一层的外文文本也将近有十种,00:07:18.005,00:07:22.300,"It has been translated into around 10 languages,"
00:07:23.191,00:07:25.440,海内外总体反映不错,00:07:22.700,00:07:25.200,and overall has been well received at home and abroad.
00:07:25.441,00:07:32.760,那么我想这至少说明就是很多人对文明行这个国家我们一会要这个概念,00:07:25.300,00:07:35.100,"This, I think, at least shows that many people agree with
or are interested in the concept of “civilizational state”."
00:07:32.761,00:07:33.840,要么是认同,,,
00:07:33.841,00:07:35.730,要么是绕有兴趣,,,
00:07:35.731,00:07:39.330,所以我想在这里跟大家进一步展开谈一谈,00:07:35.465,00:07:41.400,"So, today, I‘d like to discuss some analysis I have on this idea with you."
00:07:39.331,00:07:42.180,我的这些观点的一个分析,00:07:41.905,00:07:43.815,What is the “civilizational state”?
00:07:42.181,00:07:47.520,那么什么是文明型国家的国民国家指的是就是延绵不断,,,
00:07:47.521,00:07:50.760,长达数千年的这个中华古老文明啊,00:07:44.000,00:07:51.520,"It refers to a country like ours which has an ancient
culture that has continued for thousands of years"
00:07:50.761,00:07:52.050,这样一个古老文明,,,
00:07:52.051,00:07:57.240,有个超大型的现代国家球完全重叠这样的一个国家,00:07:51.520,00:07:56.600,and almost entirely overlaps with an enormous modern country.
00:07:57.241,00:07:58.110,所以他呢,,,
00:07:58.111,00:08:01.560,这个特质决定他和其他国家和一般国家是不一样的,00:07:57.060,00:08:01.600,This is her uniqueness.
00:08:02.640,00:08:05.220,额我是不是可以这样讲这种特质啊,00:08:02.545,00:08:06.600,I may even say that this feature is somehow like a gene.
00:08:05.221,00:08:07.320,有点像基因一样的,,,
00:08:07.321,00:08:11.550,基本上决定了今天中国的制度安排,00:08:07.045,00:08:13.500,"It fundamentally decided the blueprint of China’s [political] system, its way of development and its behavioral pattern."
00:08:11.551,00:08:13.500,道路选择和行为方式,,,
00:08:14.670,00:08:15.750,我们都知道,,,
00:08:15.751,00:08:18.330,这个我们经常讲的四大文明古国,00:08:14.355,00:08:17.785,We all know the “four ancient civilizations”.
00:08:18.331,00:08:21.810,但确实除了中国另外三个的历史,00:08:18.085,00:08:23.500,"But, except China, the history of the other three civilizations was interrupted due to many reasons."
00:08:21.811,00:08:23.370,由于种种原因都中断,,,
00:08:24.360,00:08:30.360,今天的埃及人跟法老跟金字塔其实没有任何关系,00:08:24.135,00:08:29.700,The Egyptians today have no relations with Pharaohs or Pyramids at all.
00:08:30.361,00:08:31.650,不是同一个民族,,,
00:08:31.651,00:08:32.700,不是同一个学院,00:08:30.120,00:08:34.400,"They don’t share the same nation, the blood, and the scripts with the ancient Egyptians."
00:08:32.701,00:08:33.840,不是同一个文字,,,
00:08:34.890,00:08:41.460,今天的埃及人是古埃及文明消失后从其他地方移民过来,00:08:34.980,00:08:40.700,They migrated [to the Nile] after the ancient Egyptian civilization disappeared.
00:08:41.461,00:08:44.640,而中国人死在自己的土地上的原住民,00:08:41.155,00:08:44.900,"While we Chinese are the original residents in our land,"
00:08:45.930,00:08:48.810,而且我们的文化一以贯之没有中断,00:08:45.675,00:08:49.100,and our culture lasts through thousands of years.
00:08:50.040,00:08:53.730,为了帮助大家理解文明型国家这个概念啊,00:08:49.885,00:08:53.195,"To help you understand “civilizational state”,"
00:08:53.731,00:08:57.510,我想帮助大家先了解另外概念就叫民族,00:08:53.495,00:08:58.000,I should first introduce the concept of “nation state” to you.
00:08:57.511,00:08:57.930,国家,,,
00:08:59.250,00:09:04.920,民族国家的概念在西方政治话语中几乎就等同于现代国家,00:08:58.825,00:09:04.600,"The “nation state"" in modern Western political
discourse is almost equal to “modern state”."
00:09:04.921,00:09:09.150,它包含了我们现在熟知的表述是国家主权,00:09:04.615,00:09:07.555,The “nation state” entails the well-known concepts of
00:09:09.151,00:09:10.560,领土完整,00:09:07.555,00:09:10.205,"like national sovereignty, territorial integrity,"
00:09:10.561,00:09:12.240,主权平等,00:09:10.255,00:09:11.525,"sovereign equality,"
00:09:12.241,00:09:14.520,民族认同服兵役,00:09:11.945,00:09:13.195,"national identity,"
,,,00:09:13.655,00:09:15.385,"obligation to the military service,"
00:09:14.521,00:09:18.390,兵役制清晰划分的边界,00:09:16.015,00:09:18.275,"clearly divided borders,"
00:09:18.391,00:09:18.870,国歌,,,
00:09:18.871,00:09:19.320,国旗,,,
00:09:19.321,00:09:20.460,国徽等等,,,
00:09:20.461,00:09:22.770,现代国家这些标志性的东西,00:09:18.275,00:09:23.900,"national anthem, national flag, and national emblem
which we are the symbols of a nation."
00:09:22.771,00:09:23.100,民族,,,
00:09:23.101,00:09:24.750,国家都有,,,
00:09:24.751,00:09:29.970,但是这个民族和民族国家这个意思往往不是天生的,00:09:24.465,00:09:31.200,"But the consciousness of nationality and “nation state”
needs to be constructed rather than being born with."
00:09:29.971,00:09:31.800,望着需要建构,,,
00:09:31.801,00:09:34.500,不要说这个新加坡他是1965年,00:09:31.745,00:09:35.600,Singapore became independent in 1965.
00:09:36.420,00:09:38.550,你们看李光耀先生的回忆录,,,
00:09:38.551,00:09:39.180,他就说的,,,
00:09:39.181,00:09:40.440,当时的时候,00:09:35.805,00:09:43.800,"In Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's memoir, the majority of the
Singaporean population were Chinese and Malays,"
00:09:40.441,00:09:41.880,新加坡的主要的人群,,,
00:09:41.881,00:09:42.930,一个是华人,,,
00:09:42.931,00:09:44.340,18来源,,,
00:09:44.341,00:09:45.960,还有少部分印度人,00:09:43.800,00:09:45.900,and also a small group of Indians.
00:09:45.961,00:09:46.230,他说,,,
00:09:46.231,00:09:48.900,这个华人当时大部分都认为自己是中国人,00:09:46.000,00:09:49.000,"Most of the Chinese still thought they were citizens of China,"
00:09:50.070,00:09:52.590,马来人认为自己是马来西亚人或者马来亚人,00:09:49.000,00:09:52.700,and Malay thought they were members of Malaysia.
00:09:53.850,00:09:55.500,所以他当时非常有意识,,,
00:09:55.501,00:09:57.090,推动建构,,,
00:09:57.091,00:09:59.580,就是叫做新加坡民主,00:09:53.545,00:10:01.100,"So, Mr. Li intentionally pushed forward the construction of the Singaporean nationality."
00:09:59.581,00:10:01.500,新加坡民族意识,,,
00:10:01.501,00:10:04.200,所以自己一个经典的案例,00:10:01.300,00:10:03.545,This is a classic example.
00:10:04.201,00:10:07.680,那么历史上的欧洲国家大部分都是宗教,00:10:03.875,00:10:11.400,"In history, most of European countries are religious
countries, or family countries, like the Habsburgs."
00:10:07.681,00:10:09.780,国家或者家族国家,,,
00:10:09.781,00:10:11.760,他不是家族的家族的国家,,,
00:10:11.761,00:10:13.410,是互相之间是无休止的,00:10:11.400,00:10:15.100,"They fought with each other endlessly, and the blood of
the dead streamed through history."
00:10:13.411,00:10:15.690,打造血流成河,,,
00:10:15.691,00:10:18.630,最终是到了17世纪初的这个30年,00:10:15.345,00:10:19.500,"Finally, the 30 Years' War in the early 17th century"
00:10:18.631,00:10:19.380,宗教战争,,,
00:10:20.550,00:10:21.180,十日,,,
00:10:21.181,00:10:24.930,尔曼人口几乎消失了四分之一,00:10:20.275,00:10:24.100,caused almost a quarter of the Germanic population to disappear.
,,,00:10:24.585,00:10:26.865,"Then in 1648,"
00:10:24.931,00:10:29.880,然后男在1648年签署了这个很有名要为斯巴利亚条约,00:10:26.865,00:10:29.605,the famous Westphalian Treaty was signed.
00:10:29.881,00:10:36.480,那么这个条约呢就是开始了某种意义上是一种民族国家的建构的进程,00:10:29.605,00:10:35.700,"To some extent, this treaty somehow
started the construction of ""nation-states"","
00:10:36.481,00:10:36.810,但是,,,
00:10:36.811,00:10:42.090,真的这个进程比较快的发展是在18到19世纪,00:10:36.155,00:10:41.700,"but its rapid development actually happened
during the 18th to 19th centuries."
00:10:42.091,00:10:45.840,民族主义作为一种政治运动在欧洲兴起,00:10:41.765,00:10:45.205,"So, nationalism rose in Europe as a political movement,"
00:10:45.841,00:10:48.090,然后民族国家也随之而心情,00:10:45.525,00:10:48.065,and “nation states” emerged as a result.
00:10:49.440,00:10:49.830,那么,,,
00:10:49.831,00:10:54.000,欧洲最早形成民族国家的可以说是法国,00:10:49.115,00:10:53.300,France is the first European country to form as a “nation state”.
,,,00:10:53.695,00:10:59.800,"Using its imperial power, it unified taxation and the army,"
00:10:54.001,00:11:06.900,法国通过这个皇权统一了税收有统一的军队来推动形成法兰西民族国家的意识形态非常强大的战争动员能力,00:10:59.860,00:11:03.480,"which pushed forward the French consciousness
for the nation-state to form."
,,,00:11:03.740,00:11:06.760,"With this consciousness, France greatly increased its
ability in war mobilization,"
00:11:06.901,00:11:09.180,所以很快就击败了铺路石,00:11:06.760,00:11:09.380,"and easily defeated Prussia,"
00:11:10.560,00:11:15.540,也就是德国统一之前的一盘散沙的三百多个日耳曼,00:11:10.240,00:11:13.960,which consisted of about 300 loosely-connected Germanic states
00:11:15.541,00:11:16.230,小的帮贡,00:11:13.960,00:11:16.380,before the German unification.
00:11:17.880,00:11:18.600,那接下来呢,,,
00:11:18.601,00:11:18.990,这个,00:11:17.540,00:11:21.300,"Then, Bismarck, the German Chancellor
known for his speech ""Blood and Iron"","
00:11:20.160,00:11:24.060,铁血宰相俾斯麦有远交近攻,00:11:21.300,00:11:23.880,"by ""befriending distant enemies and attacking the near ones"","
00:11:24.061,00:11:25.740,推动德意志的统一,,,
00:11:25.741,00:11:28.110,德意志民族国家的建立,00:11:23.880,00:11:27.700,pushed forward the unification of Germany and the establishment of the German “nation state”.
00:11:28.111,00:11:30.450,随着德国也迅速的发展,00:11:27.815,00:11:29.745,Germany then developed rapidly.
00:11:30.451,00:11:32.100,在亚洲就日本,,,
00:11:32.101,00:11:37.290,日本通过明治维新也形成了民族国家来加入欧洲列强,00:11:30.145,00:11:35.200,"In Asia, Japan also transformed itself into a “nation
state” through the Meiji Restoration,"
,,,00:11:35.475,00:11:37.855,and joined with the European powers.
00:11:37.291,00:11:45.000,而且在1894年95年这个甲午战争中击败了当时还一盘散沙的传统国家中,00:11:37.855,00:11:43.900,"It defeated China, which was a traditional and sluggish country,"
,,,00:11:43.900,00:11:45.920,in the First Sino-Japanese War [1894-1895].
00:11:46.770,00:11:46.980,那么,,,
00:11:46.981,00:11:49.770,中国现代民族国家自己的这个建构历程,00:11:46.460,00:11:52.220,"The journey we Chinese have taken to build  a
modern nation state is tough and arduous."
00:11:49.771,00:11:52.080,也是可以说是艰苦卓绝,,,
00:11:53.610,00:11:58.590,因为传统的中国绝大多数人口都生活在农村,00:11:53.380,00:11:57.900,"Traditionally, most of the Chinese population lived in rural areas."
00:11:58.591,00:12:01.230,那么农村的基本上都是自给自足的一种,00:11:58.305,00:12:03.400,"They live in self-sufficient, closed and patriarchal-feudal societies"
00:12:01.231,00:12:02.400,封闭社会,,,
00:12:02.401,00:12:03.810,宗法社会,,,
00:12:03.811,00:12:04.710,一个村子,00:12:03.520,00:12:05.860,"in which people in one village are from one family, and share one family name."
00:12:04.711,00:12:05.220,一个心,,,
00:12:06.300,00:12:10.740,然后知书达理的乡绅打理村里的事务,00:12:06.100,00:12:09.320,The men who were more educated than other villagers
00:12:10.741,00:12:11.880,家族间的矛盾,00:12:09.320,00:12:13.220,played the role of judge and mediator of conflicts in the village.
00:12:11.881,00:12:13.020,他们来协调解决,,,
00:12:14.280,00:12:14.610,那么,,,
00:12:14.611,00:12:17.640,中国古代的皇帝表面上权利特别大,00:12:14.000,00:12:17.415,"Although in the ancient political system,
an emperor appeared to have infinite power,"
00:12:17.641,00:12:19.200,但实际上是天高皇帝远,00:12:17.420,00:12:19.500,"in fact, his is ""skies away from the grassroots""."
00:12:20.310,00:12:25.290,中央政府往往也没有多少现在国家管理的手段,00:12:19.960,00:12:24.700,The central government lacked efficient means for modern state management.
00:12:25.291,00:12:29.460,所以比较多的依赖道德说教等等来进行统治,00:12:24.985,00:12:29.500,The Emperor’s rein mostly relied on the preaching of morality.
00:12:30.720,00:12:34.560,那么多1840年鸦片战争的时候,00:12:30.425,00:12:33.845,"Starting from 1840, the Opium War,"
00:12:34.561,00:12:37.170,当时实际上中国是被打败了,00:12:34.325,00:12:37.125,"China was defeated,"
00:12:37.171,00:12:40.830,但是中国人还没有意识到还没有真正意识到这个危机,00:12:37.125,00:12:41.100,but the Chinese hadn’t realized the indicated crisis.
00:12:41.820,00:12:45.600,因为大清输给对西方强国,00:12:41.505,00:12:44.715,"The Great Qing lost to powerful Western
countries"
00:12:45.601,00:12:47.190,那么也割让的土地,,,
00:12:47.191,00:12:50.880,但在割让土地是中国叫边缘的不毛之地,00:12:45.285,00:12:50.900,but the ceded lands were considered relatively marginal to China.
00:12:52.350,00:12:55.260,但是真的给中国带来更大震撼的是,00:12:52.045,00:12:57.000,What really shocked the Chinese was the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894.
00:12:55.261,00:12:56.940,1894年的甲午战争,,,
00:12:57.990,00:13:02.730,就是泱泱大国居然败于一个被中国人过去看不大起的小日本,00:12:57.695,00:13:03.300,"China, as a great power, was defeated by Japan, whom
China had never treated seriously."
00:13:04.290,00:13:06.570,马关条约的签订后,00:13:03.995,00:13:07.195,"After the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki,"
00:13:06.571,00:13:09.300,这个1895年五月,00:13:07.195,00:13:09.845,"for the first time, in May 1985, a Chinese official,"
00:13:09.301,00:13:12.930,严父是第一次专门写了文章,00:13:09.845,00:13:14.000,"Yan Fu wrote about “saving the dying nation”,"
00:13:12.931,00:13:14.100,喊出要救亡,,,
00:13:15.360,00:13:19.710,然后全国朝野上上下下开始喊出叫保国保种,00:13:15.080,00:13:17.600,"and then through the central and local governments,"
00:13:21.630,00:13:22.470,然后呢,00:13:17.680,00:13:20.080,"people urged to “save our country”, and “save our nation [bloodline]”."
00:13:22.471,00:13:24.480,严复语翻译的天演论,00:13:21.340,00:13:24.260,"Yan Fu also translated ""Evolution and Ethics"" into Chinese"
00:13:24.481,00:13:26.730,提出了这个大家都知道的观点,00:13:24.260,00:13:28.600,"and proposed the well-known
“Heaven's selection is the survival of the fittest”,"
00:13:26.731,00:13:27.630,物竞天择,,,
00:13:27.631,00:13:28.680,适者生存,,,
00:13:28.681,00:13:31.290,就国家间竞争非常残酷,00:13:28.600,00:13:31.240,which explains the cruelty of competition between countries.
,,,00:13:31.240,00:13:36.900,"In 1902, Liang Qichao proposed the concept of the “Chinese Nation” for the first time:"
00:13:31.291,00:13:46.560,梁启超先生在1902年应该说是第一个提出了中华民族这个概念中华民族他讲的是我们境内所有民族从过去千百年历史中演变形成的是一种大融合的结果,00:13:37.220,00:13:44.020,the Chinese nation evolved from all ethnic groups within  China's borders through thousands of years.
,,,00:13:44.500,00:13:47.760,"It is a fusion of all ethnicities,"
00:13:46.561,00:13:49.590,是荣威加的是多元混合的,00:13:48.100,00:13:50.380,and a unified family of diversity.
00:13:50.550,00:13:50.820,然后,,,
00:13:50.821,00:13:54.750,他对这个孙中山当时提出的这个口号驱除鞑虏,00:13:50.380,00:13:56.600,"He also criticized Sun Yat-sen’s slogan
 “Expel the Manchus and restore China “"
00:13:54.751,00:13:56.820,恢复中华进行了批评,,,
00:13:56.821,00:14:00.630,他觉得这个有种大汉族的这个含义,00:13:56.600,00:14:00.400,because he thought this implied Han was superior to other ethnicities.
00:14:00.631,00:14:05.970,后来孙中山他们也接受了这个梁启超的观点就是中华民族的无关,00:14:00.400,00:14:06.400,"Later, Sun Yet-sen accepted this criticism and the
concept of a whole “Chinese nation”."
00:14:07.170,00:14:07.530,那么凉,00:14:06.835,00:14:09.875,Liang Qichao repeatedly said
00:14:07.531,00:14:14.280,你要当时说了很多次说这个传统中国人的他是知有朝廷而不知有国家,00:14:09.915,00:14:16.800,that traditional Chinese people were only aware of the imperial court and had no idea of the nation.
00:14:14.281,00:14:17.790,就只知道朝廷不知道有国家,,,
00:14:17.791,00:14:20.790,那么中央政府手中也没有什么现代军队,00:14:17.485,00:14:20.495,"The central government had no modern armies,"
00:14:20.791,00:14:22.680,只有没有现代的材质,00:14:20.500,00:14:22.320,"no modern public finance,"
00:14:22.681,00:14:24.330,老百姓也没有国家的概念,00:14:22.440,00:14:24.940,so the commoners had no concept of “nation”.
00:14:25.800,00:14:30.690,所以当时你看到日本人这个对中国的描述,00:14:25.500,00:14:29.800,"If you refer to the Japanese description of China at that time,"
00:14:30.691,00:14:32.520,他们眼中中国是什么样的人物,,,
00:14:32.521,00:14:35.730,就是四分五裂内乱不息的,00:14:30.415,00:14:39.400,"they viewed China as a collection of autonomous tribes
that were divided and warring against with each other."
00:14:37.230,00:14:39.750,一大批的这个自制的部落,,,
00:14:39.751,00:14:40.800,那上边有一个,,,
00:14:41.850,00:14:44.910,空的叫国家中国像个帽子一样,00:14:39.495,00:14:43.400,"These people wore a hollow cap called “China” the country,"
00:14:44.911,00:14:46.950,戴起实价是一盘散沙,00:14:43.845,00:14:47.085,"but under this cap was ""a sheet of loose sand""."
00:14:48.510,00:14:48.810,那么,,,
00:14:48.811,00:14:50.280,中国这个概念啊,,,
00:14:50.281,00:14:53.550,实际上历史上早就出现了,00:14:48.205,00:14:53.200,"The concept of China as a country
had appeared very early in history,"
00:14:53.551,00:14:55.980,但他不是现代意义上的国家概念,00:14:53.300,00:14:56.100,"but it was not a modern state,"
00:14:57.240,00:14:59.130,二是一个朝代的概念,00:14:56.925,00:14:59.300,"rather, a series of dynasties,"
00:14:59.131,00:15:03.810,一个邦国家室的这样一种总称,00:14:59.300,00:15:03.185,"a general reference to the combination of
states and ruling families."
00:15:03.811,00:15:06.090,所以当时有个说法叫一姓之天下,,,
00:15:06.091,00:15:07.800,一个幸运异信之天下,00:15:03.520,00:15:09.520,"At that time, people said that the country was “a country under one family, rather than a country of all families”."
00:15:07.801,00:15:09.330,而不是万姓之天下,,,
00:15:10.860,00:15:11.160,那么,,,
00:15:11.161,00:15:12.780,费孝通先生也讲过,00:15:10.580,00:15:13.365,"Fei Xiaotong also said that,"
00:15:12.781,00:15:15.330,作为一个自在的民族时期,00:15:13.365,00:15:15.300,"as a national entity that exists,"
00:15:15.331,00:15:19.260,中华民族是在几千年历史过程中形成,00:15:15.300,00:15:19.040,"the Chinese nation was formed during the course of thousands of years of history,"
00:15:19.261,00:15:21.210,但作为一个自觉的民族实体,00:15:19.040,00:15:21.000,"but as a national entity conscious of itself,"
,,,00:15:21.000,00:15:23.340,it was not until the last century
00:15:21.211,00:15:30.030,中华民族是在近百年来中国对西方中国和西方列强对抗中出现就是自在的概念,00:15:23.340,00:15:28.040,when China came into confrontations with the Western powers.
00:15:30.031,00:15:32.130,它一直存在中国,00:15:28.375,00:15:31.485,The national entity has always existed.
00:15:32.131,00:15:35.400,但是到有意识的形成中国,00:15:31.940,00:15:37.000,"But the awareness of ""I am Chinese"""
00:15:35.401,00:15:36.300,我是中国人,,,
00:15:36.301,00:15:39.510,这个概念是在我们的百年近代史所形成的,00:15:37.260,00:15:39.660,didn't form until our one hundred years of modern history.
,,,00:15:40.220,00:15:42.600,"Only in modern times,"
00:15:40.560,00:15:48.990,那么也是只有到了近代中华民族真正鱼叫做非我族类的外国人发生冲突之后,00:15:42.600,00:15:48.200,"when the Chinese nation really clashed with the nations that are alien from ours,"
00:15:48.991,00:15:51.090,才意识到自己的这个,00:15:48.685,00:15:53.400,did the Chinese begin to realize we have a national identity
00:15:52.140,00:15:55.590,这种民族意识所走向民族自决,00:15:53.400,00:15:55.400,and to develop national consciousness.
00:15:55.591,00:15:59.370,大家感到中华民族是一个具有共同生存空间,00:15:55.400,00:15:58.400,The Chinese felt that the “Chinese nation” is a community
00:15:59.371,00:16:00.900,共同文化,,,
00:16:00.901,00:16:05.310,共同生活方式休戚与共的一个共同体,00:15:58.400,00:16:04.340,"in which people share the same space, the same culture, the same way of life, and are inter-dependent."
00:16:05.311,00:16:08.490,所以当时大家回想一下甲午战争的时候,00:16:05.000,00:16:08.245,"When the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894 started,"
00:16:08.491,00:16:11.040,普通老百姓感觉是个朝廷的战舰,00:16:08.245,00:16:10.585,"commoners felt it’s a “war of the court”,"
00:16:11.041,00:16:12.810,升级人被称之为陈达维,00:16:10.760,00:16:14.500,even “the war of General Li Hongzhang”.
00:16:12.811,00:16:14.340,只有李鸿章一个人的战争,,,
00:16:15.720,00:16:18.180,那么到抗战时候就不一样了,00:16:15.460,00:16:17.980,But this attitude was changed during the Second Sino-Japanese War [1937-1945].
00:16:18.181,00:16:24.210,日本军国主义的野蛮入侵带给中国老百姓的不止是沉重的灾难,00:16:17.980,00:16:20.400,The brutal invasion of Japanese militarists
00:16:24.211,00:16:26.010,而且是精神上的祖国,00:16:20.420,00:16:27.900,"brought not only [physical] disasters but also
a blow on the mentality of Chinese commoners."
00:16:26.011,00:16:26.880,着墙机,,,
00:16:28.560,00:16:28.890,那么,,,
00:16:28.891,00:16:31.830,成为中华民族崛起的催化剂,00:16:28.275,00:16:31.295,It was a catalyst for awakening the “Chinese nation”.
00:16:31.831,00:16:37.590,所以我们现在都唱国歌义勇军进行曲喊出的中华民族到了最危险的时候,00:16:31.525,00:16:35.000,"Therefore, as we sing in the national anthem
“March of the Volunteers”,"
,,,00:16:35.000,00:16:37.335,"“As Chinese nation faces its greatest peril,"
00:16:37.591,00:16:40.320,我们被迫发出最后的吼声,00:16:37.340,00:16:39.880,"""From each one the urgent call to action comes forth.”"
00:16:40.321,00:16:40.500,所以,,,
00:16:40.501,00:16:42.810,这个时候一个有血有肉的概念,00:16:40.160,00:16:44.560,That was when the “China nation” finally came into being.
00:16:42.811,00:16:44.460,中华民族形成了,,,
00:16:46.140,00:16:46.890,朱自清啊,,,
00:16:46.891,00:16:50.580,当时也曾经描述过自己的一个心情,00:16:45.540,00:16:50.200,Zhu Ziqing described his feeling he had.
00:16:50.581,00:16:50.910,他说,,,
00:16:50.911,00:16:52.950,东亚病夫居然奋起吧,00:16:50.300,00:16:53.220,"“Finally, the so-called ‘sick man of East Asia' begins to revive."""
00:16:54.060,00:16:54.900,这个税是啊,,,
00:16:54.901,00:16:56.730,果然醒过来,00:16:53.800,00:16:56.200,"""The ‘sleeping lion’ is awakened as expected."""
00:16:56.731,00:16:58.650,从前只是一块沃土,,,
00:16:58.651,00:17:02.790,一大盘散沙的死中国现在是有血有肉的活,00:16:56.380,00:17:03.400,"""The dead China, the sheet of loose sand in the past,
is now a lively land in its flesh!“"
00:17:02.791,00:17:03.210,中国,,,
00:17:04.770,00:17:04.950,那么,,,
00:17:04.951,00:17:09.210,在经过14年艰苦卓绝的抗战之后,00:17:04.445,00:17:08.700,"After 14 years of the Second Sino-Japanese War,"
00:17:09.211,00:17:13.320,中国军民最终把日本侵略者逐出国土,00:17:08.935,00:17:13.000,"Chinese people finally drove the invaders out of our land,"
00:17:13.321,00:17:15.570,一扫中华民族的百年屈辱,00:17:13.000,00:17:15.935,sweeping away the humiliation that had lasted for 100 years.
00:17:16.800,00:17:17.250,所以,,,
00:17:17.251,00:17:18.360,在这个意义上,,,
00:17:18.361,00:17:21.240,我们可以更好的理解就是毛泽东主席,00:17:16.440,00:17:21.360,"In this sense, we can better understand Chairman Mao’s
announcement to the world"
00:17:21.241,00:17:24.450,1949年10月1号向全世界宣告,00:17:21.360,00:17:25.940,"on October 1st, 1949, that the Chinese people have since then stood up,"
00:17:24.451,00:17:26.040,中国人民从此站起来,,,
00:17:27.030,00:17:30.840,我们也更能够理解在朝鲜战争,,,
00:17:30.841,00:17:32.700,抗美援朝胜利后,00:17:26.760,00:17:36.000,We can understand Marshal Peng Dehuai’ s famous comment after China’s victory of the Korean War
00:17:32.701,00:17:33.900,我们彭德怀元帅,,,
00:17:34.890,00:17:36.420,说的一句名言,,,
00:17:36.421,00:17:39.900,帝国主义在东方架起几门大炮,,,
00:17:39.901,00:17:41.610,就可以征服一个国家,00:17:36.400,00:17:43.500,that the history when imperialist countries could conquer an Eastern country or nation with canons will never repeat itself.
00:17:41.611,00:17:43.830,一个民族的历史一去不复返,,,
00:17:45.030,00:17:46.200,换言之,,,
00:17:46.201,00:17:48.360,一个觉醒的高度,00:17:44.735,00:17:51.400,"In other words, an awakened, highly-unified modern nation state was born."
00:17:48.361,00:17:50.700,团结的现代民族国家,,,
00:17:50.701,00:17:51.090,但是,,,
00:17:52.980,00:17:54.480,那么我上次呢,,,
00:17:54.481,00:18:00.390,跟大家谈过一个话题就是为什么1840年鸦片战争的时候,00:17:52.715,00:17:59.700,"Last time, I talked about why in the First Opium War in 1840,"
00:18:00.391,00:18:03.780,虽然中国的GDP总量比英国大,00:18:00.100,00:18:02.380,"China was defeated,"
00:18:03.781,00:18:07.320,但是这个被英国打败了,00:18:02.380,00:18:06.520,although the total GDP of China was larger than that of Britain.
00:18:07.321,00:18:11.010,这样就是因为英国当时已经是一个现代民族国家,00:18:06.995,00:18:10.800,It’s because Britain was already a modern “nation state”.
00:18:11.011,00:18:15.930,具有高度的战争动员能力和其他及现代国家具备能力,00:18:10.800,00:18:15.400,It had very strong ability in war mobilization and other abilities of modern countries.
00:18:15.931,00:18:17.760,而中国还是一盘散沙,00:18:15.580,00:18:18.520,"Meanwhile, China was a traditional country like a sheet of loose sand."
00:18:17.761,00:18:18.900,是一个传统国家,,,
00:18:18.901,00:18:21.030,国家意识非常弱,00:18:18.600,00:18:20.440,The people had very weak national consciousness.
00:18:21.031,00:18:24.480,但到了新中国成立之后的抗美援朝战争,00:18:20.660,00:18:24.200,"But in the Korean War, after the founding of the People’s Republic of China,"
00:18:24.481,00:18:28.140,中国军队就可以成建制的消灭英国军队,00:18:24.200,00:18:27.600,Chinese armies could systematically destroy the British army.
00:18:28.141,00:18:29.100,所以就是不一样,,,
00:18:29.101,00:18:31.320,背着大的背景的变化,00:18:27.720,00:18:30.620,This difference comes from the great changes in the historical  background.
00:18:31.321,00:18:31.560,那么,,,
00:18:31.561,00:18:33.240,谈到现代国家建构呢,00:18:30.940,00:18:33.500,"In terms of the construction of a modern country,"
00:18:33.241,00:18:36.450,我还想就是和大家简单的分享一下,00:18:33.500,00:18:39.200,"I’d like to share with you the opinion of a historian, Huang Renyu."
00:18:36.451,00:18:40.260,一位历史学家黄仁宇这个观点,,,
00:18:40.261,00:18:44.370,那么他从这个大历史观的总结了中国近代史,00:18:39.915,00:18:43.900,"Taking a historical overview of  modern Chinese history,"
00:18:44.371,00:18:50.610,所以他把中国现代国家的建构过程的分成几个几个时间段,00:18:44.035,00:18:50.300,he divides the construction of modern China into several periods.
00:18:50.611,00:18:51.180,他认为,,,
00:18:51.181,00:18:54.090,从孙中山的中华民国时期,00:18:50.540,00:18:57.040,"He sees the period from Sun Yat-sen's Republic of China [ROC] to 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China [PRC]"
00:18:54.091,00:18:57.870,一到49年之后的人民共和国时期,,,
00:18:57.871,00:19:01.050,它看作一个整体国家建构的整体,00:18:57.640,00:19:00.500,as a phase in China's national construction.
00:19:01.051,00:19:06.480,他人的民国时期的初步建构了一个现代国家的上层结构,00:19:01.020,00:19:05.960,"According to him, the ROC period built the initial “upper structures” of a modern country,"
00:19:06.481,00:19:09.540,包括各种现代政府的机构设计,00:19:06.140,00:19:09.060,"including all the institutions in a modern government,"
00:19:09.541,00:19:10.050,但他说,,,
00:19:10.051,00:19:11.040,这个结构啊,,,
00:19:11.041,00:19:14.490,无法与中国的下层结构沟通,00:19:09.235,00:19:13.700,"but this organization could not communicate with the
“lower structures” of China."
00:19:14.491,00:19:20.400,他叫国民党时期的中国是一个头重脚轻的一种政治结构,00:19:14.165,00:19:19.500,He said China under the Kuomintang had a top-heavy political structure.
00:19:20.401,00:19:20.970,他认为,00:19:19.895,00:19:23.400,"He believed that the land revolution led by the
Chinese Communist Party [CCP]"
00:19:20.971,00:19:26.130,中国共产党领导的土地革命实际上是重塑了中国的底层结构,00:19:23.400,00:19:26.200,reshaped the “lower structures”
00:19:27.240,00:19:31.890,共产党通过这个组织农民运动支援前线,00:19:26.700,00:19:29.820,"by organizing peasant movements,"
00:19:31.891,00:19:33.960,通过土改通过扫盲,00:19:29.900,00:19:31.540,"mobilizing armies to the frontline,"
00:19:33.961,00:19:36.750,把中国的底层结构层数,00:19:31.620,00:19:36.000,and through land reform and literacy education.
00:19:36.751,00:19:39.750,所以哪怕今天你到中国相对比较落后的地方,00:19:36.420,00:19:39.485,"Even today, in relatively backward areas in China,"
00:19:39.751,00:19:42.090,你到贵州的山区扶贫,00:19:39.485,00:19:41.960,"for example, in the “helping the poor” projects
in the mountains of Guizhou Province,"
00:19:42.091,00:19:43.680,他叫数目字管理,00:19:41.960,00:19:47.420,"we have ""digital management"" — the government can directly remit money to bank accounts of the poor families"
00:19:43.681,00:19:51.840,就你给这个农户贫困户与银行卡上面有卡号和手机还绑定,00:19:47.420,00:19:51.200,They have a bank card with an account number
00:19:51.841,00:19:54.840,所以政府可以把钱直接打到这个卡号上,00:19:51.505,00:19:54.355,and their account is linked with their mobile phones.
00:19:54.841,00:19:56.280,这个能力是不容易,00:19:54.520,00:19:56.080,This is not easy.
00:19:56.281,00:19:57.750,我走过很多非洲国家,,,
00:19:57.751,00:20:00.240,他的政府到现在都没有这个能力,00:19:56.080,00:19:59.480,"I have been to many African countries. Governments
there cannot do this even today."
00:20:00.241,00:20:03.540,他不可能把这个治理落实到最基层,00:19:59.895,00:20:03.055,They are unable to make the policy reach grassroots communities.
00:20:03.541,00:20:06.060,要非洲国家艾滋病非常厉害,00:20:03.185,00:20:05.935,"AIDS is a serious problem in African countries,"
00:20:06.061,00:20:09.300,但是政府想把这个要发到底层发不到的,00:20:05.940,00:20:09.160,"while the governments feel it’s hard to give away AIDS
medicine to the people."
00:20:09.301,00:20:13.050,我只是说就现代国家组织的涉及到一个底层结构的建筑,00:20:09.160,00:20:13.320,I am just commenting on the construction of the “lower structures” of a modern country.
00:20:14.190,00:20:14.550,那么,,,
00:20:14.551,00:20:18.690,王人还提出就是1978年开始的改革开放,00:20:13.920,00:20:18.200,Huang Renyu also proposes that the Reform-and-Open beginning in 1978
00:20:18.691,00:20:19.050,他说,,,
00:20:19.051,00:20:23.370,实际上是为中国重建遇到中层结构,00:20:18.520,00:20:22.500,"reshaped the “middle structure” of China,"
00:20:23.371,00:20:26.700,也就是我们叫做史和现代市场经济,00:20:23.400,00:20:25.335,"that is to say,"
00:20:26.701,00:20:27.570,现代社会,,,
00:20:27.571,00:20:31.680,现代国家相配套的司法监察,00:20:25.340,00:20:30.560,"the judiciary, governmental supervision, taxation,
logistics and other systems"
00:20:31.681,00:20:32.490,税收,,,
00:20:32.491,00:20:34.020,物流等等,00:20:30.560,00:20:36.100,"which match with and support a modern market
economy, modern society, and modern country."
00:20:34.021,00:20:39.630,这个系统支撑体系通过长达百年的不懈的努力,00:20:36.200,00:20:39.400,"Through efforts of a hundred years,"
00:20:39.631,00:20:43.770,我们应该所建立了一个由上中,00:20:39.400,00:20:48.000,"we have built a strong modern country
with three layers: top, middle, bottom."
00:20:43.771,00:20:48.390,下三层结构组成的一个强大的现代国家,,,
00:20:48.391,00:20:50.820,形成了空间统一的政府,00:20:48.080,00:20:51.180,"We have formed a modern country that has a unified government,"
00:20:51.690,00:20:52.710,统一的市场,00:20:51.380,00:20:52.600,"a unified market,"
00:20:52.711,00:20:53.640,统一的经济,,,
00:20:53.641,00:20:54.450,同名的教育,00:20:52.600,00:20:55.600,"unified economy, education, national defense,"
00:20:54.451,00:20:55.320,统一的国防,,,
00:20:55.321,00:20:56.160,统一的外角,,,
00:20:56.161,00:20:56.940,铜的金融,00:20:55.600,00:20:57.600,"unified diplomacy, finance,"
00:20:57.960,00:20:59.670,还货币税收等等,00:20:57.640,00:20:59.540,currency and taxation and so on.
00:20:59.671,00:21:01.860,这都是现代国家必备的,00:20:59.540,00:21:01.680,All are necessary to a modern country.
00:21:01.861,00:21:02.430,但是呢,,,
00:21:02.431,00:21:03.030,我想指出,,,
00:21:03.031,00:21:05.370,就是我们的国家又和其他国家不一样,00:21:01.680,00:21:06.120,"But our country is different, or quite different from other countries."
00:21:05.371,00:21:06.870,真的很不一样,,,
00:21:06.871,00:21:13.800,因为我们古老文明形成的许多传统并没有随着就是现代国家建立而消失,00:21:06.640,00:21:13.100,"Many of our old traditions haven’t disappeared with the
founding of a modern state."
00:21:13.801,00:21:14.760,恰恰相反,,,
00:21:14.761,00:21:15.840,还是被保留下来,00:21:13.640,00:21:16.340,"On the contrary, they remain,"
00:21:16.830,00:21:19.170,而且现代国家的载体中,00:21:16.480,00:21:21.400,and even further develop themselves in the modern country.
00:21:19.171,00:21:22.020,可能这些元素得到更好的发挥,,,
00:21:22.021,00:21:24.630,那么这就是我想跟大家再简单谈谈,00:21:21.695,00:21:25.700,That’s what I want to talk about the “civilizational state”.
00:21:24.631,00:21:26.730,叫文明型国家,,,
00:21:26.731,00:21:27.930,那么关于这个概念,,,
00:21:27.931,00:21:30.510,我想提三位学者,00:21:26.360,00:21:30.100,Three scholars can be related to this concept.
00:21:30.511,00:21:38.460,因为那是美国政治文化学者叫白鲁迅如仙怕他认为中国是不大可能建设成一个现代国家,00:21:30.500,00:21:34.800,"The first one is American scholar in political culture, Lucian Pye."
00:21:38.461,00:21:40.050,包括现在的法治,00:21:35.015,00:21:38.125,He believes that China is not very likely to be built as a modern state
00:21:40.051,00:21:41.190,现代的国防,00:21:38.125,00:21:42.000,"with the modern judiciary, national defense, or modern economy."
00:21:41.191,00:21:42.360,现代经济等等,,,
00:21:42.361,00:21:44.310,我们很多公司现在也这样的观点,00:21:42.060,00:21:44.900,Many of the public intellectuals in China hold the same opinion.
00:21:45.840,00:21:46.140,那么,,,
00:21:46.141,00:21:49.050,他把中国称之为文明国家,,,
00:21:49.051,00:21:51.390,英文叫C位来咨询,00:21:45.660,00:21:54.860,He calls China a “civilization-state”.
00:21:51.391,00:21:54.060,然后一个联系好黑粉,,,
00:21:54.061,00:21:55.650,是对这位来追寻时代,,,
00:21:56.790,00:22:00.150,那么他表示这两者两个名词是相同的概念,00:21:56.440,00:21:59.620,"He explains that the ""civilization"" and the ""state"" are the same."
00:22:00.151,00:22:05.220,让他讲过一句很有名的话就说是中国是一个是未来的一群朋友,00:21:59.825,00:22:09.300,"He has a famous comment: ""China is a
civilization pretending to be a state""."
00:22:05.221,00:22:09.270,肯定特别是对就是想装成现代国家的一个文明,,,
00:22:10.470,00:22:10.950,也就是说,,,
00:22:10.951,00:22:13.740,本站你是一个古老的文明,00:22:10.095,00:22:13.600,"He means that China is actually an ancient civilization,"
00:22:13.741,00:22:15.180,你不是一个现代国家,00:22:13.600,00:22:15.045,"not a modern state,"
00:22:15.181,00:22:15.840,但表面看,,,
00:22:15.841,00:22:17.370,你是一个国家,00:22:15.045,00:22:16.860,even though it seems to a country.
00:22:17.371,00:22:20.250,所以他这话里面是带有贬义的,00:22:17.020,00:22:19.700,This is a pejorative comment.
00:22:20.251,00:22:21.450,那么钓位学者,,,
00:22:21.451,00:22:24.570,那就是马丁雅克也是我的好朋友,00:22:20.280,00:22:23.020,"The second scholar is Martin Jacques, my friend,"
00:22:24.571,00:22:26.940,就会研究院的资深研究员,00:22:23.025,00:22:25.965,and a senior researcher at our China Institute.
00:22:26.941,00:22:30.720,那么他在09年时出版了一本颇有争议的书,00:22:26.645,00:22:31.500,"He published a controversial book in 2009,"
00:22:30.721,00:22:33.450,爱就是当中国统治世界,00:22:31.840,00:22:33.900,"""When China Rules the World."""
00:22:34.740,00:22:34.980,那么,,,
00:22:34.981,00:22:36.750,这个书名坦率说,,,
00:22:36.751,00:22:40.410,不太符合中国人的思维习惯,00:22:34.400,00:22:39.640,This name is alien to our Chinese thinking.
00:22:40.411,00:22:41.070,但是呢,,,
00:22:41.071,00:22:42.090,他本人也讲过,,,
00:22:42.091,00:22:43.350,他说是出版商,00:22:39.840,00:22:44.800,But the publisher insisted to use this name
00:22:43.351,00:22:48.750,坚持要用这个家才能卖号标题党标题党,00:22:44.800,00:22:47.800,— an attractive title would bring a better sale.
00:22:48.751,00:22:50.400,那么他和白鲁恂不一样,00:22:48.600,00:22:50.600,"Different from Lucian Pye,"
00:22:50.401,00:22:52.860,在什么他对文明国家的概念了,,,
00:22:52.861,00:22:57.030,做了比较中性的正面的阐述,00:22:50.600,00:22:56.360,"he elaborates rather neutrally and more positively on the concept “civilization-state”,"
00:22:57.031,00:23:00.090,随他得出一个非常明确的结论,00:22:56.700,00:22:59.760,and he reaches a clear conclusion:
00:23:00.091,00:23:03.570,就说是中国是不一样的国家,00:22:59.765,00:23:05.700,"China will not develop like Western countries,"
00:23:03.571,00:23:08.970,中国不会变成另外一个西方国家来中国的崛起会改变整个世界,00:23:06.255,00:23:09.065,and China’s rise will change the world.
00:23:10.260,00:23:12.150,所以他是做了这么一个结论,00:23:09.895,00:23:13.800,"Now, this conclusion seems reasonable."
00:23:12.151,00:23:13.740,现在看来是站得住脚,,,
00:23:15.000,00:23:15.960,但是呢,,,
00:23:15.961,00:23:17.220,马丁雅克也认为,00:23:14.655,00:23:17.425,But Martin Jacques also claims that
00:23:17.221,00:23:19.830,就是中国的这个民族,00:23:17.425,00:23:21.600,there can be certain kinds of conflicts between China’s two features:
,,,00:23:21.605,00:23:26.100,being a nation state and a traditional civilization.
00:23:19.831,00:23:35.580,国家和这个传统文明这两个特性之间可能有某种张力某种冲突不要说他认为中国可能在今后在东亚以某种形式复活自己利益上存在过的朝贡体系,00:23:26.785,00:23:30.900,"For example, he thinks that China may, in some ways,"
,,,00:23:30.900,00:23:35.400,revive the “tribute system” which existed in the history of East Asia.
00:23:36.930,00:23:37.380,他说,,,
00:23:37.381,00:23:41.520,他中国人探索实践还是有一种种族优越感,00:23:36.620,00:23:40.860,"He also claims that Chinese, in fact, feel superior about their ethnicity,"
00:23:41.521,00:23:42.120,他说,,,
00:23:42.121,00:23:45.750,可能也会对现有的国际秩序形成某种挑战,00:23:40.860,00:23:46.100,which may challenge the current international order.
00:23:46.800,00:23:49.470,那么第三个选择就是我自己,00:23:46.455,00:23:49.195,The third scholar is me.
00:23:49.471,00:23:52.350,那么我认为就是中国首先是一个现代过,00:23:49.195,00:23:52.235,"Firstly, I think China is a modern country."
00:23:53.460,00:23:59.130,额这是我对中国模式中国道路研究后得出的非常慎重的结论,00:23:53.455,00:23:56.575,This is a conclusion I cautiously make
00:24:00.480,00:24:01.290,那么,00:23:56.675,00:23:59.325,after I have studied China's mode and China's path.
00:24:01.291,00:24:06.840,但是中华文明的种种特质又使中国这个现代国家与众不同,00:24:00.125,00:24:06.200,"But traits of the Chinese civilization also make China a
modern country different from others."
00:24:06.841,00:24:09.900,所以他确实融合了这个古代文明,00:24:06.515,00:24:12.400,"Indeed, it has combined the advantages of the ancient
culture with those of the modern culture."
00:24:09.901,00:24:10.800,现代文明,,,
00:24:10.801,00:24:17.040,两者之间的长处就是我上次也简单提到过你无论走到哪里,00:24:12.575,00:24:15.085,And I have mentioned this last time:
,,,00:24:15.085,00:24:16.680,"wherever we live,"
00:24:17.041,00:24:19.860,中国是世界上最勤劳的名字,00:24:16.740,00:24:20.500,the Chinese nation is the most hard-working and the most active in the world.
00:24:19.861,00:24:21.840,最向上的米汤改变命运,00:24:20.500,00:24:22.540,We're determined to change our fate.
00:24:22.830,00:24:24.990,这个民族最平和,00:24:22.540,00:24:24.240,This is also the mildest nation.
00:24:24.991,00:24:27.930,就这些特质带来几年中国的崛起,00:24:24.660,00:24:27.320,All these features lead to China’s rise today.
00:24:27.931,00:24:33.090,那么中国也接受了现代国家一些基本的这个理念,00:24:27.625,00:24:33.000,"China has accepted some basic concepts of modern countries,"
00:24:33.091,00:24:36.120,向朱权平等向人群,00:24:33.000,00:24:35.640,"such as equality of sovereignty, human rights,"
00:24:36.121,00:24:38.400,所以中国不会恢复朝贡体系,00:24:35.800,00:24:37.900,"so China will not restore the tribute system,"
00:24:38.401,00:24:40.950,也不会拥抱种族优越论,00:24:38.220,00:24:41.140,or accept racial superiority.
00:24:42.120,00:24:45.030,所以我用的是文明型国家,00:24:41.775,00:24:47.400,That’s why I call it a “civilizational state”.
00:24:45.031,00:24:48.000,因为我的幡子随便来人一身都是的,,,
00:24:48.001,00:24:48.900,这个是个癞子,00:24:47.705,00:24:50.025,It is different from the “civilization-state”.
00:24:48.901,00:24:49.890,就是这次不一样,,,
00:24:51.090,00:24:51.420,此外,,,
00:24:51.421,00:24:54.450,事情是对是两个瓶的瓶瓶平起平坐,00:24:50.755,00:24:54.300,"""Civilization-state"" contains two concepts with equal weights,"
00:24:54.451,00:24:54.840,谁不来,,,
00:24:54.841,00:24:59.280,为什么是对自己未来人生的是个形容词文明型的修饰,00:24:54.300,00:25:00.200,"whereas in ""civilizational state"",
""civilizational"" describes the “modern state”."
00:24:59.281,00:25:00.300,这个现代国家,,,
00:25:01.590,00:25:02.220,那么,,,
00:25:02.221,00:25:07.200,所以是我这个文明型国家概念比白鲁迅的文明国家概念要积极得多,00:25:01.245,00:25:07.100,"So, the concept “civilizational state” is more positive
than Lucian Pye’s concept the “civilization-state”."
00:25:09.180,00:25:11.220,那么我一个基本的看法是,,,
00:25:11.221,00:25:15.660,我迷信国家具有超强的历史底蕴和文化底,00:25:08.825,00:25:14.800,"My basic idea is that a “civilizational state” inherits
abundant historical and cultural legacies,"
00:25:15.661,00:25:19.080,他不会跟着其他国家亦步亦趋,00:25:15.335,00:25:18.565,so it will not follow every step of other countries.
00:25:19.081,00:25:26.640,那么这种文明型国家有能力汲取其他文明的一切长处而不失去自我,00:25:18.725,00:25:26.000,"It is able to absorb the advantages of other civilizations
without losing its own identity."
00:25:26.641,00:25:31.560,而且能够对世界文明作出大量的原创性的贡献,00:25:26.280,00:25:31.000,It can make a large number of creative contributions to the global culture.
00:25:31.561,00:25:33.780,那么多次讲过这样的一个比喻,00:25:31.240,00:25:34.255,I have said this a lot:
00:25:33.781,00:25:37.380,我说就像汉语扩大自己的影响,00:25:34.255,00:25:39.900,"In order to expand the influence of the Chinese language, we need not cater for preferences of English."
00:25:37.381,00:25:39.330,不需要理会英语的偏好,00:25:40.085,00:25:43.345,"Just as Sun-Tzu's The Art of War doesn’t need approval from Clausewitz,"
00:25:40.440,00:25:46.320,就像孙子兵法不需要克劳塞维茨来人就像孔夫子不需要波拉出来认可,00:25:43.465,00:25:46.205,"or Confucius the approval of Plato,"
00:25:46.321,00:25:50.190,这样中国的宏观调控不需要美联储来认可,00:25:46.205,00:25:49.380,or China’s macro-economic regulation the approval of the Fed.
00:25:50.191,00:25:55.140,而更可能发生的事虽然已经在开始出现,00:25:49.760,00:25:54.400,It's more likely ... or have already happened
00:25:55.141,00:25:59.100,汉语可能会逐步的影响英语或者其他语言,00:25:54.600,00:25:58.640,that the Chinese language may gradually influence English or other languages.
00:25:59.101,00:26:04.530,那么孙子兵法当然已经是营销界既会影响西方的军事思想,00:25:58.800,00:26:03.680,"Sun-Tzu’s The Art of War has already changed, and will
continue to change, Western military doctrine."
00:26:04.531,00:26:09.030,孔夫子和柏拉图都为人类社会提供了宝贵的智慧,00:26:04.180,00:26:08.500,Confucius and Plato have all provided precious wisdom to this world.
00:26:09.031,00:26:10.800,那么中国的宏观调控,00:26:08.600,00:26:10.960,"As for China’s macro-economic regulation,"
00:26:10.801,00:26:14.250,我自认为美国可以借鉴不少,00:26:10.960,00:26:14.340,I do believe America can learn a lot from it
00:26:14.251,00:26:14.760,呵呵,,,
00:26:14.761,00:26:15.630,呵呵,00:26:14.340,00:26:15.280,(laughs)
00:26:15.631,00:26:16.920,但他有点困难啊,00:26:15.500,00:26:17.340,but to do so can be hard.
00:26:18.090,00:26:19.860,那么这样我们就可以回到我们,,,
00:26:19.861,00:26:23.160,在这个这个演讲开始时提出问题,00:26:17.760,00:26:22.800,"Then, we will come back to the question at the beginning of my speech."
00:26:23.161,00:26:26.280,就是西方为什么老是误读中国,00:26:22.865,00:26:25.815,Why does the West always misunderstand China?
,,,00:26:25.905,00:26:31.200,"Because the West always interprets China based on
their limited experience from their history"
00:26:26.281,00:26:27.180,因为西方了,,,
00:26:27.181,00:26:36.360,他总是基于自己的这个有限的历史经验和在这个经验计算形成话语来读中国,00:26:31.635,00:26:35.600,"and the discourses formed from these experiences,"
,,,00:26:36.000,00:26:37.660,"such as “west centrism”,"
00:26:36.361,00:26:42.120,比方说西方中心论欧洲中心论历史终结论都在这种范围下来,00:26:37.900,00:26:40.000,"“eurocentrism”, or “the end of the history”."
00:26:42.121,00:26:43.680,这个理解中国,00:26:40.000,00:26:43.300,These are the lenses through which they view China.
00:26:43.681,00:26:45.360,所以他们这个逻辑是这样的,00:26:43.335,00:26:46.075,"Their logic [of development] begins from totalitarianism,"
00:26:45.361,00:26:46.380,就是收一觉,,,
00:26:46.381,00:26:49.200,从极权主义到威权组啊,00:26:46.075,00:26:49.105,"to authoritarianism,"
,,,00:26:49.105,00:26:51.255,"then finally, ends at the Western democracy."
00:26:49.201,00:26:55.860,那再到西方民主制度这个概念下的这个历史发展是单线条的,00:26:51.655,00:26:55.700,"Under this logic, the development of history is linear,"
00:26:55.861,00:26:58.980,这种发展的西方的政治模式终结了,00:26:55.800,00:26:58.800,and it terminates at the Western political system.
00:26:58.981,00:27:03.090,所以这是我们现在看来非常荒谬的那个吴宓音国家,00:26:58.800,00:27:01.300,This is absurd in our eyes.
00:27:03.091,00:27:05.700,他崛起是一个完全不同的,00:27:01.585,00:27:06.600,The rise of a civilizational country follows a totally different logic.
00:27:07.440,00:27:14.490,首先历史上的我是长期领先西方只有领先尤其重要的原因,00:27:07.105,00:27:11.000,"In history, China was ahead of the West for a long time"
00:27:15.330,00:27:17.010,我把称谓原因一,00:27:11.775,00:27:17.100,"for an important reason — I will call it ""reason one""."
00:27:18.360,00:27:23.580,那么后来18世纪开始又落后了这个落后有深刻的教训,00:27:17.965,00:27:21.500,"Then, in the 18th century, China was left behind by the West,"
00:27:23.581,00:27:26.010,再通过过去数十年的努力,00:27:21.500,00:27:23.500,which taught us a profound lesson.
00:27:26.011,00:27:28.050,我们又真的是赶上来了,00:27:23.500,00:27:27.900,"After decades of efforts, we have finally caught up with the West,"
00:27:28.051,00:27:32.040,某些方面还超越了这个赶超的成功,00:27:27.900,00:27:30.040,and even surpassed it in some areas.
00:27:32.041,00:27:33.090,也有她的原因,00:27:30.040,00:27:34.500,"I call the reasons for this success ""reason two""."
00:27:33.091,00:27:34.110,我叫原因,,,
00:27:34.111,00:27:34.410,二,,,
00:27:35.490,00:27:41.640,这个原因二和园艺之间是有一种继承和发展的关系,00:27:35.200,00:27:40.240,"Historically speaking, reason two inherits and furthur develops reason one."
00:27:41.641,00:27:45.000,就故事立意上我为什么比你做的好,00:27:41.260,00:27:46.240,Why China was ahead of the West in history and why we could catch up or even surpass
00:27:45.001,00:27:49.740,我今天又赶上了甚至超越你是有历史的继承发展关系,00:27:46.240,00:27:49.400,is linked by historical inheritance and development.
00:27:49.741,00:27:54.810,比方我历史上我们是民本主义的传统民为邦本本,00:27:49.400,00:27:52.680,"For instance, in history, we have a people-centered tradition."
00:27:54.811,00:27:57.570,固邦宁就政府要做事情,00:27:52.780,00:27:56.240,"""People are the foundation of a country; peace is guaranteed when this foundation is solid.” [Book of Documents by Confucius]"
00:27:57.571,00:27:59.760,首先就是关注民生,00:27:56.240,00:28:03.000,"The priority of the government is people, and improving
people’s living materially and spiritually."
00:27:59.761,00:28:01.290,改善民生,,,
00:28:01.291,00:28:04.170,包括物质生活精神生活方面,,,
00:28:04.171,00:28:06.600,所以西方今天这个模式最大的问题,00:28:03.785,00:28:06.605,"However, the biggest problem of the Western model today,"
,,,00:28:06.605,00:28:09.085,"no matter in Western or non-Western countries,"
00:28:06.601,00:28:13.620,无论在西方本身还在非西方国家政治机器空转不落实到改善民生,00:28:09.085,00:28:11.540,"is the “idle spinning"" of the political machine."
,,,00:28:11.540,00:28:13.480,The government can't effectively improve people’s living.
00:28:13.621,00:28:17.250,所以西方模式在飞信上写的西方姐都开始走下坡了,00:28:13.480,00:28:17.100,"As a result, the Western system is facing a decline in
both the Western and non-Western world."
00:28:18.660,00:28:20.760,背后上是两种哲学观,00:28:18.240,00:28:20.740,Behind this are two philosophical outlooks.
00:28:20.761,00:28:24.600,一种西方中心论的这个历史单线发展的哲学观,00:28:20.740,00:28:24.500,"One is about West-centrism, a linear outlook of philosophy."
00:28:25.740,00:28:28.380,那么我代表最好的制度啊,00:28:25.340,00:28:28.560,"In this view, people believe they have the best system,"
00:28:28.381,00:28:31.260,然后你就发展到我这个制度,00:28:28.560,00:28:33.500,and others should work hard to reach the same system.
00:28:31.261,00:28:33.750,最后你就变得很好,,,
00:28:33.751,00:28:35.280,那么中国不是这样的中国人,,,
00:28:35.281,00:28:36.000,这个历史观,,,
00:28:36.001,00:28:38.970,他是一上各种模式都存在,00:28:33.600,00:28:38.400,"On the contrary, in the Chinese conception of history,
all kinds of systems have coexisted,"
00:28:38.971,00:28:40.440,从来就是百花齐放的,00:28:38.620,00:28:42.200,and sometimes even been in conflict with each other.
00:28:40.441,00:28:41.940,甚至有时候互相打架,,,
00:28:42.930,00:28:45.960,但即使你这模式过去很好,00:28:42.540,00:28:45.380,"A system might have worked well,"
00:28:45.961,00:28:49.170,但是我们讲的这个骄傲使人落后,00:28:45.580,00:28:49.240,"however, we say ""prideful people will forget to make further progress"","
00:28:49.171,00:28:51.030,如果你真的羊羊得意自满了,,,
00:28:51.031,00:28:53.400,最有可能落后被人家赶上,00:28:49.240,00:28:53.100,and they can be easily surpassed by others.
00:28:53.401,00:28:57.960,所以他这个历史竞争是复合式的多线条的动态,00:28:53.300,00:28:58.260,"The competition in Chinese
history is multiple-tracked and dynamic."
00:28:59.130,00:29:00.840,那么下周啊,,,
00:29:00.841,00:29:03.210,我还想谈就是文明型国家的,00:28:58.760,00:29:05.220,"Next week I’m going to talk about
the ""four supers” of our civilizational state:"
00:29:03.211,00:29:11.010,这个我叫四超超大型的人口规模超广阔的疆域国土超悠久的历史传统,00:29:05.820,00:29:13.280,"super large population scale, super vast territory,
super long history and super rich cultural accumulation."
00:29:11.011,00:29:12.600,超丰富的文化积淀,,,
00:29:12.601,00:29:16.890,我觉得这个是文明国家崛起的最精彩的地方,00:29:13.300,00:29:18.800,This is the most amazing part in the rise of China and will astonish the world.
00:29:16.891,00:29:17.340,然后呢,,,
00:29:17.341,00:29:18.900,会震撼整个世界,,,
00:29:18.901,00:29:20.220,今天我就说几句好吧,00:29:19.020,00:29:21.060,That’s all for today’s speech. Thank you!
00:29:20.221,00:29:20.640,谢谢大家,,,
00:29:24.360,00:29:26.010,掌声是送给张强说的,00:29:23.760,00:29:26.080,The applause is for Professor Zhang.
00:29:26.011,00:29:27.600,您辛苦了请客,00:29:26.260,00:29:28.320,Thank you for your speech. Please take a seat.
00:29:27.601,00:29:29.100,不过我是学语言出身的吧,,,
00:29:29.101,00:29:30.660,所以对刚才张总提到有一点,00:29:28.340,00:29:30.420,I majored in language studies
00:29:30.661,00:29:31.500,我感触很深,,,
00:29:31.501,00:29:35.340,就是说这个文字的这个传承下来的力量,00:29:30.420,00:29:35.160,"and I'm impressed with one thing in Professor’s speech
— the power inherited with the language we passed on."
00:29:35.341,00:29:41.640,我曾经看过这个一些民国时期的当时有一定有一个思潮说要去汉字化,00:29:35.160,00:29:40.840,There was a scholarly trend to abandon Chinese characters during the Republic of China.
00:29:41.641,00:29:42.780,经过了一些探索,,,
00:29:42.781,00:29:43.920,摸索失败尝试,00:29:41.620,00:29:45.960,"It was found impracticable after a series of exploration, trials and failures."
00:29:43.921,00:29:45.480,最后发现这个走不通,,,
00:29:45.481,00:29:46.500,走不下去,,,
00:29:46.501,00:29:47.400,这个就像您说的,,,
00:29:47.401,00:29:50.700,他跟这个民族的这个根基是有冲突的,00:29:46.520,00:29:50.560,"Just like you said, it would conflict with our national basis."
00:29:50.701,00:29:54.270,为什么明显同音字同音字那么多,00:29:50.560,00:29:54.780,"Why? Obviously, it is due to a large number of homophones."
00:29:54.271,00:29:56.400,这个所以文明型国家的这个传承,00:29:54.940,00:29:58.340,"To carry on the traditions of a civilizational state,"
00:29:56.401,00:30:01.500,他要一定要跟这个本国民族的这个习惯特点要紧密结合,00:29:58.340,00:30:01.960,things must be done according to native customs and features.
00:30:01.501,00:30:02.580,所以我就赶出这点,00:30:01.960,00:30:03.520,I totally agree with that.
00:30:02.581,00:30:05.520,特别是我们有时候一项国际接轨的国际化,00:30:03.780,00:30:06.740,"In some cases, we might lose our own features in internationalization."
00:30:05.521,00:30:06.780,就把自己给忘了,,,
00:30:06.781,00:30:09.420,所以千万不要忘记把自己给丢了哈,00:30:07.020,00:30:09.720,So never forget your own identities.
00:30:09.421,00:30:11.820,这个账号是这个演讲里面有一点,,,
00:30:11.821,00:30:15.300,我有这个深感的都有可能大家都是这个上学,00:30:10.540,00:30:13.860,I deeply resonated with one point in Professor Zhang's speech.
00:30:15.301,00:30:17.550,小时候我们看那个教科书什么一说,00:30:13.920,00:30:16.752,"When we were elementary students, we read from the textbook that"
00:30:17.551,00:30:19.170,中华民族是个勤奋的民族,00:30:16.752,00:30:18.920,the Chinese people were hardworking and diligent.
00:30:19.171,00:30:20.400,待会觉得很空洞,,,
00:30:20.401,00:30:22.140,就是哪个民族不勤奋,00:30:18.920,00:30:22.820,We felt it was hollow because all nations are hardworking.
00:30:22.141,00:30:23.400,不勤奋都很勤奋,,,
00:30:23.401,00:30:24.240,不是这样子的,00:30:22.820,00:30:24.080,But it's not so.
00:30:24.241,00:30:25.860,现在发现中华民族是真爱,00:30:24.085,00:30:26.905,Now we realize Chinese people are truly hardworking.
00:30:25.861,00:30:26.970,真勤奋,,,
00:30:26.971,00:30:28.050,这个不是开玩笑,00:30:26.905,00:30:28.120,It isn't joking.
00:30:28.051,00:30:30.930,包括到一些欧洲国家同时去旅游,00:30:28.120,00:30:31.000,Some of my colleagues traveled to Europe.
00:30:30.931,00:30:32.250,大家可能去看一下,,,
00:30:32.251,00:30:35.640,到那时你会发现别人下午早早可能四点就下班了,00:30:31.000,00:30:35.240,They found people get off work early in the afternoon at about four o'clock.
00:30:35.641,00:30:37.440,然后要杯咖啡望着大海,00:30:35.660,00:30:38.400,"They would order a cup of coffee, sit on the beach.
A whole afternoon would pass."
00:30:37.441,00:30:38.460,一下午就过去了,,,
00:30:38.461,00:30:39.030,一句话也不说,,,
00:30:39.031,00:30:41.190,黑杯咖啡看大海,00:30:38.620,00:30:42.080,"They would spend the afternoon like this, drinking coffee to the sea."
00:30:41.191,00:30:42.570,我一下午就过去了,,,
00:30:42.571,00:30:44.970,这个时候你才意识到这个小时候学的啊,,,
00:30:44.971,00:30:46.680,蒋中华民族是个勤奋的民族,00:30:42.580,00:30:47.560,Not until that time did they realize the appraisal of our diligence was pertinent.
00:30:46.681,00:30:49.200,这样不是空的是真的,00:30:47.560,00:30:49.120,It's the truth.
00:30:49.201,00:30:52.170,我们可能对自己的勤奋都已经习以为常,00:30:49.120,00:30:52.320,Probably we have been too used to our diligence
00:30:52.171,00:30:55.470,碳就像我们对自己的古老文明也习以为常,00:30:52.640,00:30:55.600,just as we have taken our ancient civilization for granted.
00:30:55.471,00:30:55.920,太一样,,,
00:30:55.921,00:30:57.660,我们都忘了去研究他,00:30:55.800,00:30:57.920,We even forgot to study it.
00:30:57.661,00:30:58.320,那接下来呢,,,
00:30:58.321,00:31:00.090,我们就要开放现场提问者啊,00:30:57.920,00:31:02.080,Now it's time for Q&As.
00:31:00.091,00:31:04.620,哈我们来举手示意我任何想问问题的朋友都可以举手,00:31:02.180,00:31:04.660,Put up your hands if you have any questions.
00:31:04.621,00:31:05.880,您抢到了话筒吧,,,
00:31:05.881,00:31:06.510,那传过来,00:31:05.220,00:31:07.200,Please pass the microphone to him.
00:31:06.511,00:31:08.610,张教授我也经常看你的节目,00:31:07.200,00:31:09.929,"Professor Zhang, I’ve seen many of your shows."
00:31:08.611,00:31:09.660,我是这么想的,,,
00:31:09.661,00:31:13.230,就是我们平时要讲究实事求是,00:31:09.929,00:31:12.940,"We say ""seek truth from facts""."
00:31:13.231,00:31:15.240,就是任何的理论观点,00:31:13.160,00:31:16.980,Any theory or viewpoint has to go through a developing period.
00:31:15.241,00:31:17.130,什么的都是要有发展的阶段,00:31:17.120,00:31:19.120,"In the case of Taiwan,"
00:31:17.131,00:31:23.310,比如说对台的那个问题能不能就是说重新去定位一下我们的一国两制政策,00:31:19.120,00:31:23.000,"I’m wondering whether we can redefine the
policy “one country, two systems”."
00:31:23.311,00:31:28.800,而且我个人认为九二共识简直就是像像我们提款的一个提款机密码了,00:31:23.260,00:31:28.100,"Personally, I’m doubting if they are using
“the 1992 Consensus” as an ATM password."
00:31:28.801,00:31:31.620,然后他们拿了我们的优惠政策,00:31:28.200,00:31:31.260,"Once they get the preferential policies from the mainland,"
00:31:31.621,00:31:33.840,有可能他们就去买武器装备,00:31:31.360,00:31:33.620,they are likely to purchase weapons [with the money].
00:31:33.841,00:31:34.950,然后说实在的,,,
00:31:34.951,00:31:36.210,如果真的要开战的话,00:31:33.780,00:31:36.880,"To be honest, if a war broke out across the Strait,"
00:31:36.211,00:31:40.080,那射向解放军的子弹有一半就是我们提供给他们的,00:31:36.960,00:31:39.680,half of the bullets fired at the PLA would be those provided by ourselves.
00:31:40.081,00:31:41.340,我们有些人就提出,00:31:39.760,00:31:42.280,Some people advise helping the KMT.
00:31:41.341,00:31:42.480,我们要帮助国民党,,,
00:31:42.481,00:31:45.090,但是我说你们提出帮助国民党,,,
00:31:45.091,00:31:46.680,那有没有想到27年的时候,00:31:42.440,00:31:48.920,"But have they ever considered how the KMT treated the Communist Party in the ""April 12 Massacre""?"
00:31:46.681,00:31:50.160,412国民党是怎么对待我们共产党的对吧,,,
00:31:50.161,00:31:54.240,所以我个人就是认为能不能就是说,00:31:49.400,00:31:56.220,"So, I’m wondering if we can re-evaluate the concept of “one country, two systems”"
00:31:54.241,00:31:58.500,我们重新思考一下一国两制的问题就是与时俱进,00:31:56.220,00:31:58.540,and keep it up with the times.
00:31:58.501,00:31:59.550,好好请教一下,,,
00:31:59.551,00:32:02.760,你是从事什么研究工作额,00:31:58.540,00:32:02.420,Would you mind telling us what area you work or research in?
00:32:02.761,00:32:04.440,我是通信工作的,00:32:02.420,00:32:04.500,I work in telecommunication.
00:32:04.441,00:32:05.940,不过我平时是军迷,,,
00:32:05.941,00:32:08.220,特别喜欢看那些军事报道,00:32:04.500,00:32:07.800,But I am a military fan and fond of military reports.
00:32:08.221,00:32:10.020,那么额我老说,00:32:08.260,00:32:10.580,I often say
00:32:10.021,00:32:12.420,就是有些东西就是中国,,,
00:32:12.421,00:32:18.150,这个词的特点是我们有一个长期的战略的思考,00:32:10.780,00:32:16.880,one feature of China’s system is that we have a long-term strategy.
00:32:18.151,00:32:21.450,实际上你给台湾的一些好处,00:32:17.900,00:32:23.500,"We don't ""haggle over every ounce"" with Taiwan
over the benefits given to it."
00:32:21.451,00:32:24.450,我们不是这样来斤斤计较的爱,,,
00:32:24.451,00:32:28.380,而在本质上是台独已经成为不可能的事情,00:32:24.060,00:32:28.280,Taiwan’s independence has essentially become impossible.
00:32:29.550,00:32:33.990,你今天大陆跟经济上跟台湾的这个联系,00:32:29.520,00:32:36.551,Their economic connection and reliance on the mainland mean that
00:32:33.991,00:32:36.810,以台湾对大陆经济上的依赖,,,
00:32:36.811,00:32:39.900,这意味着只要你正式的搞台独的话,00:32:36.551,00:32:40.835,seeking independence is suicide.
00:32:39.901,00:32:41.220,这就自杀,,,
00:32:41.221,00:32:45.090,我就不是初中人民解放军不出动的就是本身,00:32:40.840,00:32:43.920,"There’s no need to send PLA,"
00:32:45.091,00:32:47.910,你的股市将崩溃方式将崩溃,00:32:44.140,00:32:48.440,because they would have collapsing stock and housing markets.
00:32:47.911,00:32:49.500,经济将崩溃啊,,,
00:32:49.501,00:32:50.760,所以这一点就很了不起,,,
00:32:50.761,00:32:53.760,为什么中国现在很有定力对不对,00:32:49.380,00:32:54.220,"This is the most important reason
why China can keep a strategic focus."
00:32:53.761,00:32:55.650,这是最重要的爱,,,
00:32:55.651,00:32:57.840,那么至于因为你是军迷啊,00:32:55.620,00:32:58.140,"Military fan as you are,"
00:32:57.841,00:33:00.540,你可能技术角度考虑比较多,00:32:58.140,00:33:02.900,"you may consider more about the techniques
like how the bullets shoot to the PLA."
00:33:00.541,00:33:01.260,这个这个词,,,
00:33:01.261,00:33:03.480,但是像解放军啊,,,
00:33:03.481,00:33:06.930,到时候战争不会是这样打的,00:33:03.080,00:33:06.160,But the war wouldn’t go in that way.
,,,00:33:06.400,00:33:09.120,I want to add one more thing that
00:33:06.931,00:33:12.870,我又补充一点这个现代我们试以一个中国为前提的九二共识,00:33:09.120,00:33:12.460,“The 1992 Consensus” is based on “One China”.
00:33:12.871,00:33:15.510,但这个整个表述是会有细节上的不一样的,00:33:12.460,00:33:15.360,Some details may be expressed differently [by both sides].
00:33:15.511,00:33:17.310,但要我们提一国两治,,,
00:33:17.311,00:33:19.230,以前是一个一个一个方案,00:33:15.580,00:33:19.980,"And “one country, two systems” was a concept, a plan,"
00:33:19.231,00:33:24.570,这个想法现在我们希望要讨论一国两制的台湾方案,00:33:20.140,00:33:24.380,"but now we are discussing “the Taiwan solution for one country, two systems”."
00:33:24.571,00:33:29.700,而且现在岛内尽管可能从他们的报道上来说响应的人数不多,00:33:24.640,00:33:29.020,"Although according to their internal reports,
not so many people support this,"
00:33:29.701,00:33:31.560,但是是有响应的,00:33:29.140,00:33:31.880,there are still people who support this.
00:33:31.561,00:33:33.090,还有一个纠正你一个概念,00:33:31.880,00:33:34.300,"I also hope to rectify your view that
""We need to help the KMT""."
00:33:33.091,00:33:34.650,是我们要帮国民党,,,
00:33:34.651,00:33:36.060,你没有好好读这个系统,00:33:34.305,00:33:37.500,I guess you haven't fully understood documents from President Xi.
00:33:36.061,00:33:37.260,收集了很多的这个文件,,,
00:33:37.261,00:33:40.020,就是我们寄希望于台湾人民,,,
00:33:40.021,00:33:42.120,台湾各个团体,00:33:37.880,00:33:43.820,We have faith in the representatives of Taiwan people and social groups
00:33:42.990,00:33:45.390,人民的代表我们既不希望,,,
00:33:45.391,00:33:47.100,这既不寄托于国民党,00:33:44.220,00:33:49.320,"rather than the KMT, the DPP or any other parties."
00:33:47.101,00:33:49.590,也不寄托于迷倒任何政党,,,
00:33:49.591,00:33:52.890,但是任何支持统一谋求统一,00:33:49.320,00:33:54.040,But anyone supporting reunification and seeking peaceful development across the trait
00:33:52.891,00:33:56.430,谋求两岸和平发展的这才是我们要追求的对象,00:33:54.220,00:33:57.475,are the people we are going to win support from.
00:33:56.431,00:33:59.970,所以我们现在我不是对自己的同胞好啊,00:33:57.480,00:33:59.800,So we’re giving benefits to our compatriots.
00:33:59.971,00:34:03.660,我觉得真是干笑着说淡定淡定淡定好,00:33:59.800,00:34:02.840,"As Prof. Zhang said, we need to stay calm."
00:34:03.661,00:34:06.630,我们接下来再来看哪位朋友要举手啊,00:34:03.120,00:34:06.000,"OK, let's see if anyone else has a question."
00:34:06.631,00:34:10.470,这位就是我这个问题就是很明确,00:34:07.460,00:34:08.660,"Go ahead, please."
,,,00:34:08.780,00:34:11.240,I have a specific question.
00:34:10.471,00:34:18.030,就是前段时间在宪法修正案中那个提到的关于国家最高领导人这个任期限制的修改,00:34:11.240,00:34:17.600,"A while ago, the ""Constitution Amendment"" made changes to the term limit of the country's top leader."
00:34:18.031,00:34:21.870,然后这个图案其实出来之后周围的很多同学还有朋友,,,
00:34:21.871,00:34:23.760,有很多广泛的讨论,00:34:18.140,00:34:26.940,The amendment stimulated extensive discussion among my friends and some of their views are very sharp.
00:34:23.761,00:34:27.930,而且不乏其中有不少那些很尖锐的一些,,,
00:34:27.931,00:34:31.620,但是但是大家这些言论的可能都比较片面,00:34:28.200,00:34:31.180,"Our opinions may be partial,"
00:34:31.621,00:34:37.230,我在想你有没有更更全面性的站的角度不一样,00:34:31.225,00:34:36.620,"I hope to hear a more comprehensive understanding from you, from a different perspective."
00:34:37.231,00:34:41.880,不可能有一些是中国共产党的章程里是明确规定的,00:34:37.160,00:34:43.200,The Constitution of the CCP clearly stipulates the abolition of lifelong terms.
00:34:41.881,00:34:48.390,废除终身制对不对我们是交国家主席还是中国共产党员的话,00:34:44.240,00:34:48.100,"As long as the President is a member of the Communist Party of China,"
00:34:48.391,00:34:50.310,他就不能有重孙子,00:34:48.620,00:34:51.960,he cannot be in office for the length of his life.
00:34:51.630,00:34:52.380,去年四月,,,
00:34:53.520,00:34:59.670,我在美国的耶鲁大学这个谈中国崛起中国模式,00:34:53.160,00:34:59.060,"Last April, I gave a lecture on China’s rise and the China Mode at Yale University"
00:34:59.671,00:35:01.500,然后也是一个学者,00:34:59.295,00:35:02.725,a scholar raised the same question.
00:35:01.501,00:35:02.730,问你同样的问题,,,
00:35:03.960,00:35:04.110,哎,,,
00:35:04.111,00:35:08.370,我说你们美国的罗斯福总统是私人啊,00:35:03.580,00:35:08.940,"I answered former President Roosevelt served for four terms in the United States,"
00:35:08.371,00:35:14.400,对不对这个德国的阿登纳总理也是私人啊,00:35:09.480,00:35:16.760,as well as former Chancellor Adenauer and current Chancellor Merkel in Germany.
00:35:14.401,00:35:16.380,这个默克尔也是私人啊,,,
00:35:16.381,00:35:17.430,对不对,,,
00:35:17.431,00:35:18.270,而且罗斯福,,,
00:35:18.271,00:35:23.730,阿德那是公认的背着粮国家认为是极其出色的领袖人物,00:35:17.000,00:35:24.280,Roosevelt and Adenauer are recognized as outstanding leaders in these two countries.
00:35:25.230,00:35:25.710,让我说,,,
00:35:25.711,00:35:27.750,你们没有说他们是终身制,00:35:24.660,00:35:27.760,But you didn’t regard that as lifelong-term.
00:35:29.460,00:35:29.820,所以,,,
00:35:29.821,00:35:32.880,你们这些领导你担任了四任,00:35:29.080,00:35:35.180,Those leaders served four terms without the constitution declaring the abolition of a lifelong system.
00:35:32.881,00:35:34.410,而且你们没有任何章程,,,
00:35:34.411,00:35:35.730,你说废除终身制,,,
00:35:35.731,00:35:37.320,你们反而不质疑,00:35:35.580,00:35:38.620,But you’re not suspicious of them.
00:35:37.321,00:35:39.300,所以这是一个最关键的问题,00:35:38.620,00:35:40.180,That’s a contradiction.
00:35:40.410,00:35:44.070,那么我真是觉得就是政治制度的设计,,,
00:35:44.071,00:35:49.320,就是我叫做既要有下下策,00:35:40.520,00:35:50.020,I believe the design of a political system must include strategies for best and worst situations.
00:35:49.321,00:35:52.410,要有上上次下下策是保底的,,,
00:35:53.460,00:35:55.350,这包括这个领导人的这个,00:35:51.020,00:35:59.120,The worst situations may be the leader’s retirement for health reasons or limited ability.
00:35:55.351,00:35:55.890,不要说,,,
00:35:55.891,00:35:56.910,由于健康,,,
00:35:56.911,00:35:57.720,身体原因,,,
00:35:57.721,00:35:59.970,退休或者能力原因,,,
00:35:59.971,00:36:01.980,我们现在还有集体领导制度,00:35:59.680,00:36:03.000,We still preserve the system of collective leadership — democratic centralism.
00:36:01.981,00:36:03.900,民主集中制,,,
00:36:03.901,00:36:08.550,同时还有上上次上次就是在我这个制度里边,00:36:03.560,00:36:06.280,"Meanwhile, in the best situation,"
00:36:08.551,00:36:12.780,我能够让优秀的人才做好事,00:36:06.560,00:36:13.460,our system needs to allow outstanding talents to achieve high.
00:36:12.781,00:36:14.520,做大事,,,
00:36:14.521,00:36:16.440,这张老师的回答,00:36:14.200,00:36:16.475,"Thank you, Prof. Zhang."
00:36:16.441,00:36:17.730,我那个针对这个问题,00:36:16.480,00:36:18.980,"With respect to this question, I have a follow-up."
00:36:17.731,00:36:18.450,还有一个追问,,,
00:36:18.451,00:36:21.420,今年也是那个改革开放的40年的节点,00:36:18.980,00:36:23.140,"We've passed the 40the anniversary of reform and opening up, and we have entered the 41st year."
00:36:21.421,00:36:22.980,已经过了41年,,,
00:36:22.981,00:36:24.300,在这个改革的道路上,,,
00:36:24.301,00:36:26.730,就哪些能改哪些就不能改,00:36:23.140,00:36:26.540,"On the road to reform, what can we change and what should we hold up to?"
00:36:26.731,00:36:29.460,有没有就一些明确的界限,00:36:26.540,00:36:29.265,Is there a clear boundary?
00:36:29.461,00:36:31.410,正好你提子是休闲的问题,00:36:29.265,00:36:32.060,"Since you asked about the constitutional amendment,"
00:36:31.411,00:36:37.620,时尚休闲里面最关键是那句话就在宪法的第一条明确,00:36:32.260,00:36:36.640,The key point lies in the first Article in the constitution
00:36:37.621,00:36:42.540,中国共产党的领导是中国特色社会主义的最根本,00:36:36.640,00:36:43.680,which defines the leadership of the CCP as the essence of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
00:36:42.541,00:36:44.310,最本质特征是吧,,,
00:36:44.311,00:36:46.200,我自己也为研究,00:36:43.680,00:36:45.860,I’ve also studied that
00:36:46.201,00:36:50.160,就是中国共产党跟西方政党都较大,00:36:45.860,00:36:50.000,"the CCP and the Western political parties are both named as parties,"
00:36:50.161,00:36:51.570,但实际上不是一回事,00:36:50.000,00:36:52.800,but they are not the same.
00:36:52.860,00:36:55.950,那么政党这个词英文叫趴体,,,
00:36:55.951,00:36:56.880,欧子源都是这样,,,
00:36:56.881,00:36:58.020,过着反问着吧,00:36:52.800,00:37:02.560,"The English word “party” and “parti” in French
share the same language origin “part”,"
00:36:58.021,00:36:59.310,帝都都吃过了,,,
00:37:00.360,00:37:01.950,就是他对待这时候,,,
00:37:01.951,00:37:03.540,英文知道是不分的意思,,,
00:37:03.541,00:37:04.980,怕他过来,00:37:03.020,00:37:04.640,which means a section.
00:37:04.981,00:37:08.310,所以西方政党概念说简单是很简单,00:37:04.640,00:37:07.720,"Therefore, the concept of Western political parties can be explained very simply,"
00:37:08.311,00:37:11.460,就是社会不同的利益团体组成,00:37:07.880,00:37:11.180,"that is, society is composed of different interest groups."
00:37:11.461,00:37:12.210,然后没活力,,,
00:37:12.211,00:37:14.790,团结四季代表代表部分人,00:37:11.440,00:37:15.480,Each group represents the interests of some people and these groups compete.
00:37:14.791,00:37:15.900,然后出来竞争,,,
00:37:15.901,00:37:18.540,以50%U版的是由你我输入法,00:37:15.640,00:37:18.040,You win even if it's 51% against 49%.
00:37:18.541,00:37:20.190,就这样的逻辑,00:37:18.040,00:37:19.640,Such is their logic.
00:37:20.191,00:37:21.150,那么中国不一样,00:37:20.080,00:37:21.580,But things are different in China.
00:37:21.151,00:37:22.770,我觉得中国是文明型国家,00:37:21.580,00:37:23.560,Why is China regarded as a civilizational state?
00:37:22.771,00:37:29.430,为什么我面前国家最大特点是它是成百上千个国家慢慢整合起来,00:37:23.720,00:37:28.180,Its most important feature is that it is integrated from hundreds of small states over time.
00:37:29.431,00:37:30.180,这样的国家,,,
00:37:30.181,00:37:33.900,如果你采用西方的我叫部分利益党的制度的话,00:37:28.440,00:37:33.700,"If such a country adopts the party system with partial interests like Western countries,"
00:37:33.901,00:37:36.180,那国家是马上就解体了,00:37:33.700,00:37:35.620,it would soon disintegrate.
,,,00:37:35.740,00:37:38.160,"Maybe there would be a Shanghai Party, Beijing Party,"
00:37:36.181,00:37:40.800,明天就会有上海党北京到天津到无锡到济南倒,00:37:38.160,00:37:40.360,"Tianjin Party, Wuxi Party, Jinan Party,"
00:37:40.801,00:37:41.730,然后就打仗,00:37:40.365,00:37:41.980,and then wars would break out.
00:37:41.731,00:37:42.960,所以坦率的说,,,
00:37:42.961,00:37:44.880,从秦始皇统一中国以后,00:37:42.200,00:37:45.340,"Therefore, frankly speaking, ever since Qin Shi Huang unified China,"
00:37:44.881,00:37:49.470,开始绝大多数的时间内中国都是实心的,00:37:45.640,00:37:52.740,we've only had a unified ruling group most of the time.
00:37:49.471,00:37:53.160,我叫做某种形式的统一执政集团,,,
00:37:53.161,00:37:55.800,多数时间统一的儒家执政集团,00:37:52.760,00:37:55.000,And the ruling groups were mainly Confucian groups.
,,,00:37:55.360,00:37:57.400,"As I often tell Americans,"
00:37:55.801,00:37:59.520,你说我跟每个人说多数时间都是一档次,00:37:57.440,00:38:00.480,China has mostly been under the leadership of a single party
00:37:59.521,00:38:04.230,但这个多长时间内我们是远远领先西方不是一般的领先,00:38:00.480,00:38:03.420,but we were far ahead of the West most of the time.
00:38:04.231,00:38:05.460,而且在这个内部,,,
00:38:05.461,00:38:12.630,他的这个政策的调整幅度之大远远超过民主党共和党,00:38:03.780,00:38:10.620,"And the magnitude of adjustment in internal policies is far greater than in America,"
00:38:12.631,00:38:15.990,美国这种政治体制下的行政甚至调节,00:38:10.620,00:38:15.580,where the adjustments of policies are between Republicans and Democrats.
00:38:15.991,00:38:22.410,我们从文革到改革开放这个政策调整全在中国共产党内实现对不对,00:38:15.900,00:38:21.700,"By contrast, our policy adjustments from the Cultural Revolution to Reform and Opening-up were all made within the CCP."
00:38:22.411,00:38:27.090,这个远远超过美国共和党民主这个民主党之间的这个政策的差别,00:38:22.020,00:38:26.820,These changes are far greater than the changes between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.
00:38:27.091,00:38:29.730,但我们还可以做到这一点,00:38:27.360,00:38:29.160,But we were able to achieve that.
00:38:29.731,00:38:30.840,所以我是明确的,,,
00:38:30.841,00:38:32.640,说句西方世不分离,00:38:29.720,00:38:34.680,"I would say, the Western parties are partial-interest groups while China has a representtive of its collective interest."
00:38:33.540,00:38:36.000,中国是整体利益导致最大的差,00:38:34.960,00:38:36.500,That’s the biggest difference.
00:38:36.001,00:38:40.200,而且你可以反过来用这个来看西方你碰到老外就问他,00:38:36.500,00:38:38.980,And you can view the West from this perspective.
00:38:40.201,00:38:45.150,你们国家有没有代表整体利益的政党呵呵,00:38:39.060,00:38:42.980,"You can ask foreigners, is there any party in your country representing the collective interest?"
00:38:45.151,00:38:50.250,结果差异这必杀技就是我们到了今天这个地步,00:38:44.100,00:38:46.860,"- Few.
- This is our unique skill."
00:38:50.251,00:38:51.750,觉得今天这个阶段,00:38:47.360,00:38:51.620,We've gone all the way to this day.
00:38:52.830,00:38:54.780,要建立制度认同,00:38:52.420,00:38:56.020,Institutional acceptance must be established.
00:38:54.781,00:38:57.960,不能再真的云里雾里的这叫制度自信,00:38:56.020,00:38:58.820,This is our confidence about our system.
00:38:57.961,00:39:01.050,爱爱过你爱着中华人民共和国自己,00:38:58.860,00:39:00.640,"We love our country,"
00:39:01.051,00:39:04.620,包括基于中华民国宪法的整个的制度安排,00:39:00.640,00:39:04.460,and we accept the entire institutional arrangement based on the Constitution of the PRC.
00:39:04.621,00:39:06.240,他可能不一定十全十美,00:39:04.480,00:39:06.280,It may not be perfect.
00:39:06.241,00:39:07.980,我们再将改革在家完善,00:39:06.280,00:39:08.760,That’s why we have been seeking reform and improvement.
00:39:08.970,00:39:12.150,所以这是根本性的东西是不能动摇的,00:39:09.080,00:39:11.380,But the foundation is not to be shaken.
00:39:12.151,00:39:13.470,我经常说的我说,,,
00:39:13.471,00:39:14.940,这个吸脂玉主政以后,00:39:11.780,00:39:15.520,"As I often say, the biggest change during President Xi’s presidency"
00:39:14.941,00:39:20.010,最大变化就是他真的希望我们直接一起建立制度认同,00:39:15.620,00:39:19.400,comes from his sincere hope that the intellectuals can form institutional acceptance.
00:39:20.011,00:39:21.240,而在过去的40年,,,
00:39:21.241,00:39:25.200,中国就是从一个很穷的国家建设成一个世界第二大经济体,00:39:19.760,00:39:24.740,"In the past 40 years, China has developed from a poor country to the second largest economy,"
00:39:25.201,00:39:26.640,世界上最大的贸易国家,00:39:24.740,00:39:27.840,the biggest trading state with the most foreign exchange reserve.
00:39:26.641,00:39:28.080,拥有最大的外汇储备,,,
00:39:28.081,00:39:29.820,七亿多人的吧异人啊,00:39:27.840,00:39:31.220,"700 to 800 million people have been pulled out of poverty,"
00:39:29.821,00:39:33.540,这个脱贫人的历史上从来没有过的成就,00:39:31.220,00:39:33.740,which is an achievement never seen in human history.
00:39:33.541,00:39:35.160,我们自己要清楚啊,00:39:33.900,00:39:36.280,We must be clear about what we have done.
00:39:35.161,00:39:36.270,我们做了什么,,,
00:39:36.271,00:39:39.000,对推罗刚讲的这点特别谢谢,00:39:36.360,00:39:39.500,I agree with Qin Zhuo. Thank you.
00:39:40.740,00:39:41.970,真的特别棒,00:39:40.240,00:39:42.960,Thanks for showing your approval.
00:39:41.971,00:39:43.740,大家自发响起的掌声,,,
00:39:43.741,00:39:44.340,我们再来看,,,
00:39:44.341,00:39:45.570,还有哪位要提问,00:39:43.640,00:39:45.380,Anyone else has a question?
00:39:45.571,00:39:46.500,张教授您好,00:39:45.540,00:39:47.440,"Nice to see you, Professor Zhang."
00:39:46.501,00:39:47.340,就是现在呢,,,
00:39:47.341,00:39:48.630,有一句话挺流行的,,,
00:39:48.631,00:39:50.520,就是就叫做什么大名,00:39:47.440,00:39:51.960,Many people say “The Chinese civilization no longer exists since the collapse of the Ming Dynasty”.
00:39:50.521,00:39:52.470,之后无华夏他的意思,,,
00:39:52.471,00:39:53.160,就是说呢,,,
00:39:53.161,00:39:54.900,就是明朝灭亡了以后呢,,,
00:39:54.901,00:39:58.620,中国这个传统的华夏文明的已经不完整了,00:39:51.960,00:39:58.100,It means traditional Chinese civilization is no longer intact after the Ming Dynasty.
00:39:58.621,00:39:59.010,张教授,,,
00:39:59.011,00:40:00.510,您说的这个文明型国家,00:39:58.400,00:40:01.780,"Prof. Zhang, when you talk about “civilizational state”,"
00:40:00.511,00:40:04.470,我们是不是要恢复原来那个最正统,00:40:01.780,00:40:05.680,"does it mean we’re going to restore the ""orthodox"" Chinese civilization?"
00:40:04.471,00:40:09.420,最传统的华夏文明不同观点可以互相讨论辩论,00:40:07.000,00:40:09.200,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:40:11.070,00:40:13.530,我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:40:10.600,00:40:12.400,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:40:13.531,00:40:14.790,中国人你要自信,00:40:13.400,00:40:14.400,"China, be confident."
00:40:16.740,00:40:19.500,这次中国青张维迎说,00:40:16.320,00:40:19.500,China Now with Zhang Weiwei
00:40:22.560,00:40:23.700,我想是这样的,00:40:19.500,00:40:22.180,"Translators: The Magpie Bridge Brigade 鹊桥小队翻译组
Twitter/FB/IG @BrigadeMagpie 微信公众号/微博: 鹊桥小队翻译组"
00:40:23.701,00:40:28.650,就是中国这个文明源远流长,00:40:22.180,00:40:28.400,"China, as a long and far-reaching civilization,"
00:40:29.670,00:40:34.620,那么当中有很多这个磕磕碰碰的这个历史,00:40:29.880,00:40:34.520,has experienced so many ups and downs in history.
00:40:34.621,00:40:36.000,跌宕起伏的历史,,,
00:40:38.460,00:40:41.790,但我觉得这个基本的事实最闻名,00:40:38.040,00:40:42.420,but the fact is its civilization has not been interrupted.
00:40:41.791,00:40:42.930,他没有中断,,,
00:40:42.931,00:40:44.910,你只要使用汉字这个语言,00:40:42.580,00:40:45.140,"As long as Chinese characters are still in use,"
,,,00:40:45.140,00:40:46.820,the civilization will not disappear.
00:40:44.911,00:40:48.750,在他文化就一定是你就懂了两三百个成语,00:40:46.820,00:40:49.015,"As long as you understand two or three hundred chengyu idioms,"
00:40:48.751,00:40:51.510,中国文化基本的道理都在你的血液中,00:40:49.020,00:40:52.075,the basics of Chinese morals are in your blood.
00:40:52.770,00:40:55.860,确定中断不了的最最关键的,00:40:52.280,00:40:55.100,These couldn't be interrupted. It’s the key point.
00:40:55.861,00:40:57.690,所以千万不要得出结论,00:40:55.440,00:40:58.900,So don’t come to a conclusion easily that our civilization was cut.
00:40:57.691,00:40:59.550,这个文明中断掉了啊,,,
00:40:59.551,00:41:01.320,这是我对你的第一个键,00:40:59.165,00:41:01.365,This is my first piece of advice.
,,,00:41:02.000,00:41:06.940,"Secondly, we must keep pace with time."
00:41:02.430,00:41:02.910,第二呢,,,
00:41:02.911,00:41:03.510,就是,,,
00:41:05.520,00:41:13.890,恐怕还要与时俱进中国文明词这个包容性师一般文明绝对没有的包括儒释道互补,00:41:07.460,00:41:10.100,"The inclusiveness of Chinese culture is unique all around the world,"
,,,00:41:10.300,00:41:14.320,"which can be seen from the supplementation among Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism."
00:41:14.940,00:41:16.860,那个文是到台湾,00:41:14.520,00:41:17.340,"When I was in Taiwan, they asked me,"
00:41:16.861,00:41:17.280,他们说,,,
00:41:17.281,00:41:18.660,你们还有中国文化嘛,,,
00:41:18.661,00:41:19.380,对不对你看,,,
00:41:19.381,00:41:22.110,经过文革都否定掉了,00:41:17.380,00:41:21.640,"""Do you still have the Chinese culture? It was totally repudiated since the Cultural Revolution."""
00:41:22.111,00:41:23.640,让你看这个特别,00:41:22.160,00:41:24.760,"However, after my travels to over a hundred countries,"
00:41:23.641,00:41:25.230,我走遍了一百多个国家之后,,,
00:41:25.231,00:41:27.210,中国文化无处不在呀,00:41:24.760,00:41:26.980,I found that Chinese culture existed everywhere.
00:41:27.211,00:41:28.770,否定不掉的,00:41:27.140,00:41:29.760,There's no way to repudiate it.
00:41:28.771,00:41:30.360,没有办法的就说,,,
00:41:30.361,00:41:32.220,在老百姓生活层面,00:41:29.760,00:41:33.340,The culture always remains in Chinese people's daily life.
00:41:32.221,00:41:33.870,它的文化一直在,,,
00:41:33.871,00:41:42.330,其实我在这个意义上一种更加博大的胸襟来谈中国文化的继承和对整个世界的影响,00:41:33.900,00:41:41.460,So need a broader outlook when we talk about how Chinese culture can be inherited and influence the world.
00:41:42.331,00:41:43.350,最角度谈,,,
00:41:43.351,00:41:47.760,其实我觉得华夏文化最大的特点就是他不断的融合,00:41:42.860,00:41:47.340,I think the most significant feature of Chinese culture is constant integration.
00:41:47.761,00:41:48.960,所以其实一直到今天,,,
00:41:48.961,00:41:49.950,我们还在融合,00:41:47.340,00:41:52.440,"Even to this day, it is still evolving and absorbing good things from other cultures."
00:41:49.951,00:41:52.620,还在吸收那些优秀的东西,,,
00:41:52.621,00:41:54.090,还在兼收并蓄,00:41:52.720,00:41:55.140,Still “incorporating things of a diverse nature”.
00:41:54.091,00:41:55.740,所以我们一直是在这个主线上,,,
00:41:55.741,00:41:56.310,我们再来看,,,
00:41:56.311,00:41:57.780,还有哪位要提问,00:41:55.360,00:41:57.400,Anyone else has any questions?
00:41:57.781,00:41:58.380,张教授您好,,,
00:41:58.381,00:42:01.350,您觉得就是我们当下的政治制度,00:41:57.500,00:42:01.080,"Hello Professor Zhang, what positive experience do you think"
00:42:01.351,00:42:10.680,中国特色社会主义制度从中国古代的政治制度里面就是吸取了哪些有益的一些养分的一个很好的问题,00:42:01.080,00:42:08.580,"our current ""socialist system with Chinese characteristics"" absorbs from our ancient political system?"
00:42:10.681,00:42:13.500,我现在只想问一下您是从事什么研究额,00:42:10.120,00:42:13.100,Could I chip in a word? I what field do you work or study?
,,,00:42:13.200,00:42:14.860,I'm an interior designer.
00:42:13.501,00:42:17.280,我是做室内设计的室内设计,00:42:15.040,00:42:16.380,Oh really?
00:42:17.281,00:42:20.910,但是你为什么会对这样的历史政治的话题感兴趣额,00:42:16.700,00:42:20.260,Then why would you be interested in this question?
00:42:20.911,00:42:22.710,其实因为我是从高中开始,,,
00:42:22.711,00:42:27.270,就是因为自己对中国文化传统也就比较比较热吧,00:42:20.360,00:42:26.720,I have been interested in our traditional culture since high school.
00:42:27.271,00:42:30.270,然后自己觉得从那个鸦片战争以来,00:42:26.940,00:42:32.060,I know we’ve been so aggrieved since the Opium War.
00:42:30.271,00:42:32.370,觉得我们受了很多委屈,,,
00:42:32.371,00:42:37.020,然后现在可能就是经过一百多年仁人志士的努力,00:42:32.520,00:42:37.380,"Fortunately, we are growing stronger with the efforts of dedicated patriots over the last century,"
00:42:37.021,00:42:41.880,特别是中国共产党成立到了那个改革开放到去年四十周年吗,00:42:37.520,00:42:41.580,especially after the founding of CCP and the 40 years’ reform and opening up.
00:42:41.881,00:42:43.020,一步步强大,,,
00:42:43.021,00:42:44.850,我们先又提到文化自信,00:42:41.820,00:42:44.840,Now we are talking about cultural confidence.
00:42:44.851,00:42:48.750,但我想那个中国古代的政治制度作为传统文化一部分,00:42:44.840,00:42:47.580,"As a part of the traditional culture,"
00:42:48.751,00:42:51.750,那到底有哪些好的地方,00:42:48.320,00:42:54.640,what merits of the ancient political system have been inherited and reserved?
00:42:51.751,00:42:54.810,就是被我们当今继承和保存下来,,,
00:42:54.811,00:42:55.620,哈看来,,,
00:42:55.621,00:42:57.360,是因为对历史政治矢志不渝,00:42:55.320,00:42:58.500,You seem to be a devoted fan of Chinese history and culture.
00:42:57.361,00:42:59.310,有研究的爱好者请做啊,00:42:58.500,00:42:59.540,Have a seat.
00:42:59.311,00:43:00.660,虽然选择了室内设计,00:42:59.540,00:43:01.940,"Although he works as an interior designer,"
00:43:00.661,00:43:06.630,但也是在建设我们美好用实际行动建设美好的社会特别棒,00:43:02.080,00:43:05.500,he's also devoting himself to design our society.
,,,00:43:05.940,00:43:07.120,That's awesome.
00:43:08.310,00:43:10.650,不同观点可以互相讨论辩论,00:43:08.100,00:43:10.300,Different views can be discussed and debated.
00:43:12.330,00:43:14.760,我们一点都不害怕竞争,00:43:12.000,00:43:14.000,We are not at all afraid of competition.
00:43:14.761,00:43:16.050,中国人你要自信,00:43:14.600,00:43:16.000,"China, be confident."
00:43:17.160,00:43:19.770,就是中国请张维维说,00:43:17.205,00:43:19.725,China Now with Zhang Weiwei

00:43:22.980,00:43:23.940,姐姐问你很好,00:43:22.440,00:43:24.700,That’s a great question.
00:43:23.941,00:43:28.980,那么额中国你看好了今天成功的地方啊,00:43:25.060,00:43:30.800,Almost all our success today has its own historical heritage.
00:43:28.981,00:43:30.810,几乎都有历史的记忆,,,
00:43:31.830,00:43:37.320,你不要说我们最大的成功是老百姓生活的改善,00:43:31.400,00:43:37.460,"For instance, the improvement of people’s living standard is our biggest success."
00:43:37.321,00:43:41.580,这跟我们历史上的就是民本传统有关系,00:43:37.580,00:43:39.900,"It comes from our traditional people-centered doctrine,"
00:43:41.581,00:43:42.720,仅限于邦本本,00:43:39.900,00:43:44.160,in which “people are the foundation of a nation and it will be stable only if the foundation is solid.”
00:43:42.721,00:43:44.100,固邦宁,,,
00:43:44.101,00:43:44.640,你不要说,,,
00:43:44.641,00:43:48.570,我们这个现在的干部选拔制度,00:43:44.160,00:43:48.180,Another example is our meritocratic system for selecting and appointing officials.
00:43:48.571,00:43:49.980,我叫选贤任能,,,
00:43:49.981,00:43:54.300,他实践和历史上的科举制度是一种延续和发展,00:43:48.580,00:43:55.320,"It is actually a continuation and development of the imperial examination system, but with new components."
00:43:54.301,00:43:56.040,还只是加了很多新的内容,,,
00:43:56.041,00:43:59.250,就是中国不能接受小嘴皮就可以当选,00:43:56.280,00:43:59.500,Lip service is not acceptable in this selection system.
00:43:59.251,00:43:59.610,村长说,,,
00:43:59.611,00:44:00.510,你要一个宽带费,,,
00:44:00.511,00:44:01.890,可以要资质的,00:43:59.560,00:44:01.800,You must be qualified.
00:44:01.891,00:44:03.810,你要干过一些事情,,,
00:44:03.811,00:44:04.830,然后有政绩,00:44:02.040,00:44:06.600,You must have work experience and good performance.
00:44:04.831,00:44:07.860,然后才能够做出来就一直一看,,,
00:44:07.861,00:44:10.920,只要是中国成功的地方啊,00:44:06.740,00:44:11.700,Almost all the developed areas in China are equipped with a combination of three factors:
00:44:10.921,00:44:13.920,他基本上包含了一个是历史基因,00:44:12.180,00:44:14.000,"historical heritage,"
00:44:13.921,00:44:16.140,一个新的现代元素,,,
00:44:16.141,00:44:19.710,有时还有红色元素这三者合一,00:44:14.160,00:44:18.400,"modern factors and sometimes elements of the
“red culture” [communist revolutions]."
00:44:19.711,00:44:22.080,关于这个文明型国家的这一集啊,00:44:19.740,00:44:23.760,"Professor Zhang has given a keynote speech on the topic of ""civilizational state"""

00:44:24.391,00:44:26.100,然后现场有很多朋友的提问,00:44:23.940,00:44:26.060,and it inspired so many questions.
00:44:26.101,00:44:28.320,其实我特别享受这样的一个对话,00:44:26.060,00:44:28.980,I enjoy such dialogue so much.
00:44:28.321,00:44:31.950,但是因为时间的关系实在没有办法再开放太多的提问了,00:44:29.480,00:44:31.520,But I'm afraid there's not enough time for more questions.
00:44:31.951,00:44:32.820,我们把这些提问,,,
00:44:32.821,00:44:33.510,如果想问的话,00:44:31.940,00:44:34.580,You can keep your questions for the next episode.
