00:08:29.920,00:08:31.330,已有两个月的身孕,00:08:29.120,00:08:30.530,He told me I've been pregnant for two months.
00:08:32.550,00:08:33.330,不错,00:08:31.750,00:08:32.530,Very well.
00:08:34.380,00:08:36.750,算起来是有两个月了,00:08:33.580,00:08:35.950,Indeed it should be two months.
00:08:38.850,00:08:39.710,恭喜惠嫔,00:08:38.050,00:08:38.910,"Congratulations, Concubine Vertu."
00:08:43.940,00:08:45.050,惠嫔有了身孕,00:08:43.140,00:08:44.360,"Since Concubine Vertu is pregnant,"
00:08:45.810,00:08:46.770,苏培盛在,00:08:45.010,00:08:45.970,"- Su Peisheng.
- Yes."
00:08:46.940,00:08:48.770,快还不把惠嫔的菜式,00:08:46.140,00:08:49.840,Change Concubine Vertu's dishes to be the same as Consort Lumière's.
00:08:49.070,00:08:50.650,换成跟熹妃一样的,,,
00:08:50.860,00:08:51.520,嘛,00:08:50.060,00:08:50.720,Yes.
00:08:52.530,00:08:53.390,今年夏天,00:08:51.730,00:08:52.590,"This summer,"
00:08:54.070,00:08:56.190,宫里的菊花早早就开了,00:08:53.270,00:08:55.390,the chrysanthemums in the harem bloomed much earlier.
00:08:57.570,00:08:59.780,起先还担心是妖异之兆,00:08:56.770,00:08:58.980,I was worried that it was an ill omen.
00:09:00.790,00:09:03.650,如今看来原是主大喜的,00:08:59.990,00:09:02.850,Now it seems it was auspicious.
00:09:05.290,00:09:07.660,嬛嬛和眉儿都有了身孕,00:09:04.490,00:09:06.860,Huan Huan and Meizhuang are both pregnant.
00:09:09.170,00:09:12.330,宫中从未有过这样的喜事,00:09:08.370,00:09:11.530,There has never been such a joyful time in the harem.
00:09:16.680,00:09:18.540,你这一怀孕可真是金贵了,00:09:15.880,00:09:17.740,Now you have become the most precious.
00:09:19.470,00:09:21.680,太后日日叫人来送滋补品不说,00:09:18.670,00:09:20.831,The Empress Dowager sends health tonics every day.
00:09:22.180,00:09:23.340,连皇后也派剪秋,00:09:21.380,00:09:23.840,And the Empress sends Autumn over three times a day.
00:09:23.680,00:09:24.670,一日三趟地过来,,,
00:09:25.520,00:09:26.930,我最烦剪秋过来,00:09:24.720,00:09:26.130,It's annoying to see Autumn here.
00:09:27.440,00:09:28.770,明知她没安好心,00:09:26.640,00:09:29.360,I have to fake a smile despite knowing she's up to no good.
00:09:29.060,00:09:30.180,还不得不敷衍着,00:09:29.810,00:09:30.920,It's exhausting.
00:09:30.610,00:09:31.720,当真是累得慌,,,
00:09:32.360,00:09:33.100,可不吗,00:09:31.560,00:09:32.300,Indeed.
00:09:33.940,00:09:35.350,她家主子一病几个月,00:09:33.140,00:09:34.550,The Empress has been sick for months.
00:09:35.860,00:09:36.980,宫里一下就多了两位,00:09:35.060,00:09:37.320,"Meanwhile, two high-ranking concubines got pregnant."
00:09:37.360,00:09:38.150,有位有孕的嫔妃,,,
00:09:38.620,00:09:39.780,她能不着急上火吗,00:09:37.820,00:09:38.980,Of course she is anxious.
00:09:40.950,00:09:43.110,就算这回她有三头六臂,00:09:40.150,00:09:42.310,"This time, even if she has ""three heads and six arms,"""
00:09:43.410,00:09:44.780,我看也是应付不过来了,00:09:42.310,00:09:43.980,she can't handle it all.
00:09:46.870,00:09:49.240,你呀也别老费神了,00:09:46.070,00:09:48.440,Just save yourself from any mental labor.
00:09:50.500,00:09:53.080,你记着饮食一定要清淡,00:09:49.700,00:09:52.280,Remember to have a light diet.
00:09:53.420,00:09:55.910,少喝茶少吃辛辣刺激的东西,00:09:52.620,00:09:55.110,Don't drink too much tea or eat too much spicy food.
00:09:56.510,00:09:58.460,那香料更是碰也碰不得,00:09:55.710,00:09:57.660,Keep away from any incense.
00:09:59.640,00:10:02.050,眼见着真是要做额娘的人了,00:09:58.840,00:10:02.920,"Your belly becomes bigger and
your words become more maternal."
00:10:02.390,00:10:03.750,嘴也变得琐碎起来,,,
00:10:04.220,00:10:06.590,这些话来来回回地说了多少遍,00:10:03.420,00:10:07.816,"I've been getting an earful of these words,
and my ears are almost growing calluses."
00:10:06.980,00:10:08.890,听得我耳朵都快起茧子了,,,
00:10:09.650,00:10:10.930,真是不识好人心,00:10:08.850,00:10:10.200,"My good intention is wasted, it seems."
00:10:12.400,00:10:13.180,亏得太后,00:10:11.600,00:10:14.440,"I'm glad the Empress Dowager sent
Wen Shichu to take care of your pregnancy."
00:10:13.480,00:10:15.270,派了温实初来照料你的身孕,,,
00:10:15.940,00:10:18.150,要不然换了谁我都不放心,00:10:15.140,00:10:17.350,I don't trust anyone else.
00:10:18.780,00:10:20.240,就算太后指了旁人,00:10:17.980,00:10:19.440,"If Her Majesty sent someone else,"
00:10:20.820,00:10:21.900,我也是不肯的,00:10:20.020,00:10:21.100,I wouldn't accept them.
00:10:22.910,00:10:23.820,这些年,00:10:22.110,00:10:25.160,He has been taking care of my health all these years.
00:10:24.080,00:10:25.990,我的身子一直都是他在照料,,,
00:10:26.580,00:10:28.040,若是换了别的太医,00:10:25.780,00:10:29.880,I won't believe a word from any other imperial doctors.
00:10:28.410,00:10:30.700,我肯定一字不信一句不听的,,,
00:10:31.250,00:10:33.870,现下你这头快八个月了,00:10:30.450,00:10:33.070,You have been pregnant for almost eight months.
00:10:34.670,00:10:36.580,我这儿又不足三月,00:10:33.870,00:10:39.130,"I'm pregnant for less than three months.
It's the most unstable time for pregnancy."
00:10:37.340,00:10:39.130,正是最不安稳的时候,,,
00:10:39.930,00:10:41.590,亏得他两头辛苦了,00:10:39.130,00:10:40.790,He must be exhausted looking after us both.
00:10:42.390,00:10:43.420,辛苦归辛苦,00:10:41.590,00:10:42.920,This is hard work for him.
00:10:44.060,00:10:45.420,总归你们母子平安,00:10:43.260,00:10:45.000,"As long as you and your child are safe and healthy,"
00:10:46.020,00:10:47.130,也算这么多年来,00:10:45.220,00:10:48.240,his effort over these years will be recognized.
00:10:47.640,00:10:49.050,他对我们尽心尽力了,,,
00:10:49.480,00:10:50.180,是啊,00:10:48.680,00:10:49.380,Right.
00:10:51.150,00:10:54.430,这个孩子来得意料之外,00:10:50.330,00:10:53.096,"This child came unexpectedly,"
00:10:55.230,00:10:56.310,但既然有了,00:10:54.430,00:10:58.480,but I will do everything to protect it.
00:10:56.940,00:10:59.310,我必定拼尽全力去保护他,,,
00:11:01.200,00:11:02.690,你总是不肯原谅皇上,00:11:00.000,00:11:01.965,"Even though you don't forgive His Majesty,"
00:11:03.740,00:11:05.700,可孩子到底是无辜的,00:11:02.940,00:11:04.900,"the child is innocent, after all."
00:11:05.990,00:11:08.240,皇上是皇上孩子是孩子,00:11:04.900,00:11:07.440,"The emperor is the emperor, and my child is my child."
00:11:08.830,00:11:11.070,他怎可与我的孩子相提并论,00:11:08.030,00:11:10.270,They cannot be mentioned on equal terms.
00:11:12.710,00:11:15.170,姐姐刚有孕也别老躺着了,00:11:11.653,00:11:14.370,"Meizhuang, don't lie in bed all day."
00:11:16.340,00:11:17.540,不如去叫上敬妃,00:11:15.540,00:11:18.400,Let's go visit Consort Honnête with Consort Estime.
00:11:18.010,00:11:19.210,咱们去看看端妃吧,,,
00:11:20.760,00:11:21.420,好,00:11:19.960,00:11:20.620,Sure.
00:11:23.010,00:11:24.880,惠嫔入宫多年,00:11:22.210,00:11:25.920,Concubine Vertu got pregnant after many years in the harem.
00:11:25.510,00:11:26.750,一朝有喜,,,
00:11:27.060,00:11:27.920,如此福泽,,,
00:11:28.640,00:11:32.810,连本宫都觉得这日子是有盼头了,00:11:26.260,00:11:32.000,"Your good fortune makes me feel that
 even I have a life to look forward to."
00:11:37.820,00:11:39.930,奴才该打奴才偷懒,00:11:37.020,00:11:39.130,I deserve punishment for being careless.
00:11:40.530,00:11:41.810,给各位小主请安,00:11:39.730,00:11:41.010,Peace to Your Highnesses.
00:11:45.910,00:11:46.940,皇上在里头吗,00:11:45.110,00:11:46.140,Is His Majesty inside?
00:11:47.580,00:11:48.240,是,00:11:46.780,00:11:47.440,Yes.
00:11:48.490,00:11:50.610,皇上在里头来看端妃娘娘,00:11:47.690,00:11:49.810,His Majesty is visiting Consort Honnête.
00:11:51.660,00:11:54.080,那是我们不巧不敢打扰了,00:11:50.860,00:11:53.280,How coincidental. We'll take our leave then.
00:11:54.580,00:11:55.320,苏公公,00:11:53.780,00:11:54.680,"Mr. Su,"
00:11:56.040,00:11:57.580,你服侍皇上这么多年,00:11:55.240,00:11:58.400,"having served His Majesty for so many years,
you deserve some rest now and then."
00:11:58.090,00:11:59.200,也该偷空歇歇,,,
00:11:59.920,00:12:02.260,要不然如何应付得来呢,00:11:59.120,00:12:01.460,"Otherwise, how would you have energy for all your tasks?"
00:12:03.300,00:12:04.920,谢娘娘体恤,00:12:02.500,00:12:04.120,I thank Your Highness.
00:12:05.970,00:12:08.210,公公的东西掉了,00:12:05.170,00:12:07.410,"Sir, you dropped something."
,,,00:12:10.040,00:12:10.800,Oh my.
00:12:13.190,00:12:14.020,你看看,00:12:12.390,00:12:13.040,Look at this.
00:12:14.940,00:12:17.050,这手艺呀真是好,00:12:14.140,00:12:16.250,How beautifully done!
00:12:17.610,00:12:18.310,让我想起,00:12:16.810,00:12:19.720,"It reminds me of Concubine Aide,
 who was best at weaving tassel knots."
00:12:18.520,00:12:20.520,从前襄嫔是最会打缨络的,,,
00:12:21.070,00:12:23.400,可是手艺都不如这个精巧,00:12:20.270,00:12:22.720,But her knots aren't as fine as this one.
00:12:25.450,00:12:26.940,这倒是像你的手艺呀,00:12:24.650,00:12:26.140,It seems to resemble your work.
00:12:28.660,00:12:30.530,娘娘过誉了 奴,00:12:27.860,00:12:29.730,Your Highness speaks too highly of me. I...
00:12:33.290,00:12:34.240,好好收着吧,00:12:32.490,00:12:33.553,Take good care of it.
00:12:35.500,00:12:36.330,多谢娘娘,00:12:34.700,00:12:35.530,"Thank you, Your Highness."
00:12:40.460,00:12:42.000,小主陵容小主来了,00:12:39.660,00:12:41.200,"My Lady, Concubine An is here."
00:12:42.550,00:12:44.830,这么晚来没有打扰姐姐吧,00:12:41.750,00:12:44.030,"I hope my late-night visit doesn't disturb you, Meizhuang."
00:12:45.510,00:12:46.750,你怎么有空来了,00:12:44.710,00:12:46.080,"What brings you here, Lingrong?"
00:12:47.640,00:12:49.970,听说姐姐有孕 特意恭喜姐姐,00:12:46.840,00:12:49.170,I came specifically to congratulate you on your pregnancy.
00:12:50.430,00:12:52.220,姐姐不会嫌我不请自来吧,00:12:49.630,00:12:51.420,I hope you don't mind that I invited myself.
00:12:52.600,00:12:54.720,怎么会呢你来得正好,00:12:51.800,00:12:53.920,Not at all. You've come at a good time.
00:12:55.140,00:12:57.600,我想给我的孩子绣个虎头帽,00:12:54.340,00:12:56.798,I want to make a tiger-head hat for my child
00:12:58.110,00:13:00.770,想让他出世以后就暖暖和和的,00:12:57.288,00:13:00.000,to keep him warm as soon as he is born.
00:13:01.280,00:13:04.110,可是这虎须却怎么也绣不好了,00:13:00.480,00:13:03.310,But I can't embroider the whiskers right.
00:13:04.860,00:13:05.650,给我看看,00:13:04.060,00:13:04.963,Let me see.
00:13:26.840,00:13:27.750,这样好不好,00:13:26.040,00:13:26.950,How about this?
00:13:29.600,00:13:31.180,果然经你的手一绣,00:13:28.800,00:13:31.840,It looks very different now with your skilled hands.
00:13:31.510,00:13:32.670,确实大不一样啊,,,
00:13:33.850,00:13:36.680,到时再在两根虎须上嵌上颗明珠,00:13:33.050,00:13:37.560,It will look nicer if you add pearls onto the whiskers.
00:13:37.150,00:13:38.390,戴上就更好看了,,,
00:13:38.940,00:13:41.600,如此甚好那你再教我绣一个,00:13:38.140,00:13:40.800,"I like that idea. Teach me more, please."
00:13:48.740,00:13:50.200,小主请吃安胎药吧,00:13:47.940,00:13:49.400,"My Lady, please have the prenatal tonic."
00:13:50.910,00:13:51.520,怀孕的时候,00:13:50.110,00:13:52.720,"It's bad for your eyes to do needlework
 for too long during pregnancy."
00:13:51.830,00:13:53.530,针线活做久了会伤眼睛,,,
00:13:53.870,00:13:54.660,多谢温大人,00:13:53.070,00:13:53.860,"Thank you very much, Dr. Wen."
00:14:00.540,00:14:01.410,多谢皇上,00:13:59.740,00:14:01.200,I thank Your Majesty.
00:14:02.460,00:14:04.500,朕瞧你的胄口比熹妃还弱,00:14:01.660,00:14:03.700,Your appetite is even worse than Consort Lumière's.
00:14:04.800,00:14:06.080,这两天进得不香吗,00:14:04.000,00:14:05.571,Are you not eating well these days?
00:14:06.880,00:14:08.000,你的脸色不好,00:14:06.000,00:14:07.200,You look unwell today.
00:14:08.890,00:14:11.250,小主昨儿后半夜就一直头晕不适,00:14:08.090,00:14:11.560,"My lady started to feel sick late last night,
and couldn't sleep well."
00:14:11.600,00:14:12.380,睡也睡不好,,,
00:14:13.680,00:14:16.590,怎么了找太医来瞧过吗,00:14:12.880,00:14:15.790,What was wrong? Have you called for a doctor?
00:14:16.890,00:14:17.850,太医说没事,00:14:16.090,00:14:17.050,The doctor said I'm fine.
00:14:18.350,00:14:19.760,你的神色很不好,00:14:17.550,00:14:18.960,But you look really unwell.
00:14:20.400,00:14:22.680,许是昨晚和安嫔妹妹说话,00:14:19.600,00:14:23.000,"It might be because I got tired from
 talking to Lingrong last night."
00:14:22.940,00:14:23.800,费了些精神,,,
00:14:24.230,00:14:25.600,后来就睡不着了,00:14:23.430,00:14:24.800,I couldn't fall asleep after that.
00:14:25.860,00:14:26.690,安嫔来过,00:14:25.060,00:14:26.000,Concubine An was here?
00:14:27.700,00:14:28.940,她不是在静修吗,00:14:26.900,00:14:28.291,I thought she was in isolation.
00:14:29.570,00:14:30.730,安嫔妹妹难得来,00:14:28.770,00:14:31.920,"Lingrong rarely comes, so I didn't want to turn her away."
00:14:31.280,00:14:32.740,臣妾也不好不见,,,
00:14:33.200,00:14:34.860,总归是姐妹一场啊,00:14:32.400,00:14:34.060,"After all, we are like sisters."
00:14:35.370,00:14:36.280,小主还说呢,,,
00:14:36.620,00:14:38.410,最近安嫔每见小主一次,00:14:34.570,00:14:38.920,But My Lady ... You get unwell every time you see Concubine An.
00:14:38.710,00:14:39.740,小主总是不舒服,,,
00:14:40.830,00:14:41.490,真的吗,00:14:40.030,00:14:40.841,Is that true?
00:14:42.670,00:14:43.700,奴婢不敢说谎,00:14:41.870,00:14:43.080,I dare not lie to Your Majesty.
00:14:45.340,00:14:46.500,朕知道你不敢,00:14:44.540,00:14:45.700,I know.
,,,00:14:50.340,00:14:50.879,Tell Su Peisheng
00:14:51.140,00:14:53.590,让苏培盛告诉安嫔,00:14:51.991,00:14:52.960,to inform Concubine An
00:14:54.640,00:14:56.300,别再来碎玉轩了,00:14:53.584,00:14:55.498,to stop coming to the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:14:56.640,00:14:58.350,省得冲撞了惠嫔 不吉利,00:14:55.676,00:14:57.550,I don't want her to bring bad luck to Concubine Vertu.
00:14:58.730,00:14:59.310,嗻,00:14:57.752,00:14:58.332,Yes.

00:15:01.440,00:15:03.220,是 多谢皇上,00:15:00.640,00:15:02.420,Yes. I thank Your Majesty.
00:15:03.520,00:15:05.680,你看这个字念什么字啊,00:15:02.934,00:15:04.880,How do you read this character?
00:15:06.070,00:15:06.730,大,00:15:05.270,00:15:06.080,"Da.

00:15:07.490,00:15:08.690,胧月真聪明,00:15:06.690,00:15:07.890,Longyue is so smart.
00:15:09.280,00:15:12.110,那大字下面再多一点呢,00:15:08.480,00:15:11.310,"How about adding a dot under ""da""?"
00:15:12.910,00:15:13.610,太,00:15:12.110,00:15:13.080,"Tai.
[太 overly]"

00:15:19.910,00:15:20.620,快请进,00:15:19.110,00:15:19.920,Show him in.
00:15:24.790,00:15:25.700,给敬娘娘请安,00:15:23.990,00:15:25.239,Peace to Your Highness Consort Estime.
00:15:26.500,00:15:27.290,哥哥,00:15:25.520,00:15:26.600,"Gege.
[elder brother]"
00:15:27.710,00:15:29.200,四阿哥这么早来本宫这儿,00:15:26.910,00:15:29.400,"What brings you here so early, Hongli?"
00:15:29.470,00:15:30.170,有什么事啊,,,
00:15:30.510,00:15:31.670,儿臣要去给额娘请安,00:15:29.710,00:15:31.760,I was passing by on my way to pay respects to Mother.
00:15:32.010,00:15:32.590,路过咸福宫,,,
00:15:33.140,00:15:34.920,特来接妹妹去永寿宫请安,00:15:32.340,00:15:34.280,I hoped to pick up Longyue so she can come with me.
00:15:36.060,00:15:37.300,四阿哥到底懂规矩,00:15:35.260,00:15:36.500,"Fourth Prince, you are very well-mannered."
00:15:37.560,00:15:39.510,隔天就接公主去永寿宫请安,00:15:36.760,00:15:39.224,"You come here to bring the Princess to the
Palace of Eternal Longevity every other day."
00:15:40.600,00:15:41.720,妹妹是额娘的女儿,00:15:39.800,00:15:41.220,Longyue is the daughter of Mother.
00:15:42.020,00:15:43.760,和儿臣一起向额娘尽孝道,00:15:41.220,00:15:43.840,It's only right for us to fulfill our filial duties to Mother.
00:15:43.940,00:15:44.640,是应该的,,,
00:15:45.940,00:15:48.150,是啊 早去早回吧,00:15:45.140,00:15:47.350,Exactly. Go now so you can return early.
00:15:52.860,00:15:53.900,儿臣可以带胧月,00:15:52.060,00:15:54.880,"May I bring Longyue back after having breakfast
in the Palace of Eternal Longevity?"
00:15:54.240,00:15:55.700,在永寿宫用了早膳再回来吗,,,
00:15:57.790,00:15:58.490,好啊,00:15:56.990,00:15:57.760,Certainly.
00:15:59.790,00:16:01.030,你们都跟着去,00:15:58.990,00:16:00.230,You two go with the princess.
00:16:01.500,00:16:02.200,是,00:16:00.700,00:16:01.400,Yes.
00:16:02.540,00:16:03.280,儿臣告退,00:16:01.740,00:16:02.894,"I'll take my leave, Your Highness."
00:16:21.020,00:16:21.850,如意,00:16:20.220,00:16:21.050,"Ruyi,"
00:16:24.100,00:16:25.390,你说四阿哥这么做,00:16:23.300,00:16:25.360,do you think Consort Lumière
00:16:27.230,00:16:28.600,是不是熹妃教的,00:16:26.039,00:16:28.140,told the Fourth Prince to do this?
00:16:29.940,00:16:30.810,难道,00:16:29.000,00:16:30.010,Is she ...
00:16:33.780,00:16:36.070,真想把胧月从我这儿夺走吗,00:16:32.980,00:16:35.270,really going to take Longyue away from me?
00:16:36.780,00:16:37.770,娘娘别多心,00:16:35.980,00:16:37.158,"Don't overthink, Your Highness."
00:16:58.550,00:17:00.720,娘娘 奴婢带敬妃娘娘来了,00:16:57.750,00:16:59.920,"Your Majesty, Consort Estime came with me."
00:17:01.640,00:17:02.220,传,00:17:00.840,00:17:01.600,Bring her in.
00:17:03.310,00:17:03.920,是,00:17:02.510,00:17:03.120,Yes.
00:17:06.060,00:17:07.470,皇后的病到底如何,00:17:05.260,00:17:06.670,How is the Empress's illness?
00:17:08.270,00:17:09.980,皇后的头风病发作了几日,00:17:07.470,00:17:09.400,Her Majesty has had a severe migraine for several days.
00:17:10.440,00:17:11.100,就快好了,00:17:09.640,00:17:10.668,She's about to recover.
00:17:12.740,00:17:13.940,她是要好了,00:17:11.940,00:17:13.619,"I'm afraid that after she recovers,"
00:17:14.490,00:17:17.400,只怕本宫就要多无数烦恼了,00:17:13.619,00:17:16.600,I'll have endless headaches.
00:17:20.830,00:17:21.530,旁人都以为,00:17:20.030,00:17:22.360,Everyone thinks I've been pregnant for only eight months.
00:17:21.830,00:17:23.160,本宫只有八个月的身孕,,,
00:17:24.160,00:17:25.450,到了万不得以的时候,00:17:23.360,00:17:26.800,We need to have preparations for every circumstance.
00:17:26.250,00:17:27.610,有些措施要先准备好,,,
00:17:28.830,00:17:29.620,娘娘放心吧,00:17:28.030,00:17:28.971,"Don't worry, Your Highness."
00:17:30.380,00:17:31.660,一切都准备好了,00:17:29.580,00:17:30.860,Everything is ready.
00:17:34.300,00:17:36.760,本宫的临盆之期已不远,00:17:33.500,00:17:35.960,My due date is near.
00:17:37.800,00:17:39.790,但惠嫔的身孕未满三月,00:17:37.000,00:17:40.120,"But Concubine Vertu's pregnancy is in the
first three months and not yet stable."
00:17:40.100,00:17:40.930,还不稳妥,,,
00:17:41.140,00:17:44.600,本宫便把惠嫔母子全权托付给你,00:17:40.340,00:17:43.800,I entrust you with the safety of Concubine Vertu and her child.
00:17:47.690,00:17:48.470,你怎么了,00:17:46.702,00:17:47.670,What's wrong?
00:17:49.650,00:17:51.980,这些日子看你憔悴了不少,00:17:48.850,00:17:51.180,You look haggard these days.
00:17:53.780,00:17:56.140,微臣只是精神有些恍惚,00:17:52.980,00:17:55.340,My mind was wandering.
00:17:56.400,00:17:57.060,不打紧,00:17:55.600,00:17:56.260,Nothing serious.
00:17:59.120,00:18:00.530,如今你身上倚着,00:17:58.320,00:18:01.840,"Now you are responsible for looking after
Concubine Vertu and me, and our children."
00:18:00.740,00:18:02.650,本宫与惠嫔两对母子的安危,,,
00:18:03.080,00:18:03.910,难免受累,00:18:02.280,00:18:03.223,You must be exhausted.
00:18:05.120,00:18:06.530,你若不保养好自己,00:18:04.320,00:18:07.720,"But how can you take care of us
 if you don't look after yourself?"
00:18:07.210,00:18:08.490,我们又如何安身呢,,,
00:18:10.210,00:18:12.450,微臣一直以为自己是个医者,00:18:09.410,00:18:13.360,"I used to think that as a doctor,
I could cure people and save lives."
00:18:13.000,00:18:14.160,可以治病救人,00:18:15.830,00:18:16.597,But ...
00:18:16.630,00:18:19.590,可事实却不是这样,00:18:17.440,00:18:19.633,that's not the fact.
00:18:21.050,00:18:22.040,好端端的,00:18:20.250,00:18:23.240,What makes you speak such discouraged words?
00:18:22.430,00:18:23.970,怎么说起这么灰心的话来,,,
00:18:24.770,00:18:25.850,倒不是微臣灰心,00:18:23.970,00:18:25.050,I'm not feeling discouraged.
00:18:26.680,00:18:28.770,只是这宫里待得时日久了,00:18:25.880,00:18:27.970,"But the longer I stay in the palace,"
00:18:29.230,00:18:31.560,有些事情总是身不由己,00:18:28.430,00:18:30.760,the more things are out of my control.
00:18:32.270,00:18:33.680,人人都会身不由己,00:18:31.470,00:18:32.880,Everyone feels constrained.
00:18:33.980,00:18:35.310,人人都有自己的难处,00:18:33.180,00:18:34.510,Everyone has their difficulties.
00:18:36.190,00:18:37.430,该来的总会来的,00:18:35.390,00:18:36.630,"Whatever happens, happens."
00:18:38.070,00:18:39.480,一步步走下去就是了,00:18:37.270,00:18:38.680,"Just move forward, step by step."
00:18:40.200,00:18:41.400,可是有些事情,00:18:39.400,00:18:40.713,But there are some things -
00:18:42.160,00:18:42.900,微臣从不认为,00:18:41.360,00:18:43.612,that I never thought would happen to me.
00:18:43.280,00:18:44.520,会发生在自己的身上,00:18:43.892,00:18:44.722,Does that matter?
00:18:44.870,00:18:45.700,那又如何,,,
00:18:46.500,00:18:48.280,一个男人总有自己的担当,00:18:45.700,00:18:47.480,A man has to face up to his own responsibilities.
00:18:49.540,00:18:52.120,遇到任何事 膝盖不能软,00:18:48.740,00:18:51.320,"No matter what you encounter, don't bow down to it."
00:18:53.040,00:18:54.030,不光是为了自己,00:18:52.240,00:18:53.381,"Not only for yourself,"
00:18:54.880,00:18:55.790,也是为了别人,00:18:54.080,00:18:54.990,but also for others.
00:18:59.180,00:19:00.210,男人的担当,00:18:58.380,00:18:59.588,A man's responsibilities...
00:19:02.510,00:19:03.250,娘娘,00:19:01.710,00:19:02.714,Your Highness.
00:19:04.390,00:19:05.550,不嬛妹妹,00:19:03.590,00:19:04.750,"No, Huan'er."
00:19:06.520,00:19:08.380,我若是犯下了任何弥天大错,00:19:05.720,00:19:07.580,If I had made the biggest mistake...
00:19:09.140,00:19:11.230,妹妹你是否能够原谅我,00:19:08.340,00:19:10.430,would you forgive me?
00:19:13.310,00:19:14.430,你犯下的任何错,00:19:12.359,00:19:13.756,Any mistakes you might have made -
00:19:14.820,00:19:15.800,都不必让我来原谅,00:19:13.756,00:19:15.226,I am not the one to forgive them.
00:19:16.530,00:19:18.140,自己问心无愧最要紧,00:19:15.730,00:19:17.340,As long as your heart has no regrets.
00:19:19.610,00:19:22.450,若是做不到就尽量弥补,00:19:18.810,00:19:21.650,"Otherwise, try your best to make up for it."
00:19:23.120,00:19:24.200,不要再有错事,00:19:22.320,00:19:23.588,And don't repeat the same mistake.
00:19:26.790,00:19:27.900,妹妹所说极是,00:19:25.990,00:19:27.213,"You are exactly right, Huan'er."
00:19:29.830,00:19:31.700,刚刚妹妹所托惠嫔一事,00:19:29.030,00:19:30.900,I will do my best to
00:19:32.210,00:19:33.370,我自当尽心竭力,00:19:31.410,00:19:32.570,take care of Concubine Vertu.
00:19:33.830,00:19:35.750,赴汤蹈火 在所不辞,00:19:33.030,00:19:34.950,"Even if I have to ""walk through fire and boiling water."""
00:19:37.050,00:19:38.080,微臣先告退了,00:19:36.250,00:19:37.480,Allow me to take my leave.

00:20:06.330,00:20:08.660,小主说槿汐不在永寿宫,00:20:05.530,00:20:07.440,You know where she would be
00:20:09.120,00:20:09.950,她能去哪儿啊,00:20:07.520,00:20:09.150,other than in our palace.
00:20:12.160,00:20:13.750,有些话搁到心里就好了,00:20:11.360,00:20:12.950,Keep those words inside your heart.
00:20:14.500,00:20:15.240,别胡说,00:20:13.520,00:20:14.560,Don't speak them out loud.
00:20:16.960,00:20:18.540,皇后娘娘驾到,00:20:16.160,00:20:17.740,Her Majesty the Empress.
00:20:18.880,00:20:20.370,端妃娘娘驾到,00:20:18.080,00:20:19.570,Her Highness Consort Honnête.
00:20:20.760,00:20:22.710,敬妃娘娘驾到,00:20:19.960,00:20:21.910,Her Highness Consort Estime.
00:20:28.760,00:20:30.380,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:20:27.960,00:20:29.580,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:20:30.850,00:20:31.510,起来吧,00:20:30.050,00:20:30.710,Rise.
00:20:32.350,00:20:33.470,谢皇后娘娘,00:20:31.550,00:20:32.670,I thank Your Majesty.
00:20:39.360,00:20:42.570,熹妃照理说你的宫里,00:20:38.560,00:20:41.770,"Consort Lumière, usually I would not"
00:20:42.950,00:20:44.560,本宫是可以不来的,00:20:42.150,00:20:43.760,come to your palace.
00:20:45.450,00:20:47.910,只是因为你是胧月公主的生母,00:20:44.428,00:20:47.244,"I am here only because you are the birth mother of Princess Longyue,"
00:20:48.240,00:20:49.200,又怀着身孕,00:20:47.440,00:20:48.400,and pregnant.
00:20:49.830,00:20:52.320,有些事情不能不顾着你的颜面,00:20:49.030,00:20:52.040,"To protect your prestige in this issue,"
00:20:53.210,00:20:56.990,所以本宫只好叫了端妃和敬妃,00:20:52.410,00:20:56.190,I have had to ask both Consort Honnête and Consort Estime
00:20:57.330,00:20:58.670,一起过来走一趟,00:20:56.530,00:20:57.870,to come here with me.
00:21:00.840,00:21:02.500,多谢皇后娘娘关怀体恤,00:21:00.040,00:21:01.700,I thank Your Majesty for the caring words.
00:21:04.130,00:21:05.790,臣妾不知道发生了什么事,00:21:03.330,00:21:04.990,I do not know what has happened.
00:21:06.220,00:21:07.800,还请娘娘明白告知,00:21:05.420,00:21:07.000,Would Your Majesty please be explicit?
,,,00:21:07.670,00:21:08.994,I have been sick for months
00:21:08.470,00:21:11.340,本宫身体不适病了这几个月了,00:21:08.994,00:21:12.710,"and have had no strength to resolve anything
even if I had the heart to."
00:21:11.680,00:21:13.510,什么事情都有心无力,,,
00:21:14.020,00:21:15.050,所以都撒手,00:21:13.220,00:21:14.680,So I left every single thing
00:21:15.480,00:21:17.970,交给了端妃和敬妃操劳,00:21:14.680,00:21:17.170,under Consort Honnête and Consort Estime's care.
00:21:19.900,00:21:22.230,端妃的身子一向就弱,00:21:19.100,00:21:21.430,Consort Honnête's health has always been weak.
00:21:22.740,00:21:24.730,而敬妃带着胧月公主,00:21:21.940,00:21:24.118,Consort Estime needs to look after Princess Longyue.
00:21:25.280,00:21:26.560,也是自顾不暇,00:21:24.118,00:21:25.986,so she already has a lot to take care of.
00:21:27.070,00:21:28.730,难免有些纰漏,00:21:26.270,00:21:28.118,It's natural that they have overlooked some issues.
00:21:29.330,00:21:32.240,娘娘请息怒 都是臣妾的过失,00:21:28.530,00:21:31.440,"May Your Majesty's anger be calmed, the negligence is mine."
00:21:32.830,00:21:33.570,起来吧,00:21:32.030,00:21:32.770,Rise.
00:21:34.330,00:21:35.190,谢娘娘,00:21:33.530,00:21:34.654,I thank Your Majesty.
00:21:37.210,00:21:40.200,后宫安宁关系着前朝的平静,00:21:36.410,00:21:39.400,The peace in the harem has great relation to stability in the imperial court.
00:21:40.800,00:21:43.380,所以本宫不能不格外小心,00:21:40.000,00:21:42.580,So I have to be excessively careful.
00:21:44.800,00:21:46.380,可是今时今日,00:21:44.000,00:21:45.580,"But now today,"
00:21:46.800,00:21:49.540,咱们眼皮子底下竟出了这样的事,00:21:46.000,00:21:48.740,this kind of issue happened right under our noses.
00:21:50.100,00:21:51.340,还出在你宫里,00:21:49.300,00:21:50.540,And in your palace.
00:21:51.890,00:21:54.010,所以本宫不能不震怒,00:21:51.090,00:21:53.285,That is why I am so shocked and angry.
00:21:56.140,00:21:57.350,请皇后明示,00:21:55.340,00:21:56.550,Please enlighten me.
00:21:58.690,00:21:59.680,明朝宫中,00:21:57.739,00:21:59.328,"In the palace of the Ming Dynasty,"
00:21:59.940,00:22:02.430,常有宫女与太监私相交好,00:21:59.328,00:22:01.630,many maids and eunuchs had intimate relationships
00:22:02.780,00:22:03.760,称为对食,00:22:01.630,00:22:02.960,"and became ""eat-together partners."""
00:22:04.690,00:22:07.440,逐渐狼狈为奸结党乱政,00:22:03.890,00:22:06.753,Gradually they developed into factions and interfered in state governance.
00:22:07.950,00:22:10.480,明朝江山大半毁于此,00:22:07.150,00:22:09.718,Half the reason for the Ming Dynasty's ruin was due to this.
00:22:11.330,00:22:13.320,所以本朝治宫严谨,00:22:10.530,00:22:12.595,"So, the palace rules in our dynasty are strict."
00:22:13.990,00:22:16.530,对食之事鲜有闻说,00:22:13.190,00:22:15.956,"Although we have rarely heard of any occurrence of ""eat-together partnerships,"""
00:22:16.960,00:22:19.160,可是今日竟在眼皮子底下,00:22:16.160,00:22:18.360,we found one today
00:22:19.460,00:22:20.410,发现了这个,00:22:18.360,00:22:19.310,right under our eyes!
00:22:21.630,00:22:22.330,剪秋,00:22:20.830,00:22:21.530,Autumn.
00:22:25.210,00:22:28.000,熹妃你可识得,00:22:24.410,00:22:26.920,"Consort Lumière, do you recognize this?"
00:22:29.800,00:22:32.010,这东西倒是眼熟得很,00:22:28.840,00:22:31.210,It looks very familiar.
00:22:32.390,00:22:33.470,像是在哪儿见过,00:22:31.340,00:22:32.972,I seem to have seen it before somewhere.
00:22:34.810,00:22:37.260,这缨络的手艺看上去,00:22:33.880,00:22:38.360,This tassel knot resembles the word of my maid Jinxi.
00:22:37.560,00:22:39.350,倒像臣妾宫里槿汐的手法,,,
00:22:40.020,00:22:43.430,你真有眼力正是崔槿汐的东西,00:22:39.220,00:22:42.630,Well-spotted. It is exactly from Cui Jinxi.
00:22:45.150,00:22:46.440,槿汐也真是的,00:22:44.350,00:22:45.828,Jinxi must have been very careless.
00:22:46.780,00:22:47.560,这么个年纪了,00:22:45.980,00:22:48.260,She still cannot look after her belongings at this age.
00:22:47.900,00:22:49.060,自己的东西还管不好,,,
00:22:49.660,00:22:50.900,多谢皇后娘娘,00:22:48.700,00:22:50.000,I thank Your Majesty.
00:22:51.620,00:22:52.530,等槿汐回来,00:22:50.660,00:22:52.960,I’ll discipline her when she comes back.
00:22:52.830,00:22:53.940,臣妾一定好好教训她,00:22:53.160,00:22:54.880,Losing an item is nothing serious.
00:22:54.200,00:22:55.990,丢东西倒没什么大不了,,,
00:22:56.370,00:22:57.530,最要紧的,00:22:55.570,00:22:56.730,The issue is that
00:22:57.870,00:23:01.160,是苏培盛一直贴身收着,00:22:56.900,00:23:00.360,this item had been kept closely by Su Peisheng.
00:23:03.670,00:23:05.910,崔槿汐已经给看管起来了,00:23:02.870,00:23:05.110,Cui Jinxi has already been detained.
00:23:06.510,00:23:09.000,也不需要熹妃你去管教了,00:23:05.710,00:23:08.200,You don’t need to instruct her anymore.
,,,00:23:08.800,00:23:09.651,Consort Estime.
00:23:09.930,00:23:12.010,敬妃你说,00:23:10.254,00:23:11.520,Go ahead.
00:23:13.550,00:23:15.590,是是这样,00:23:13.240,00:23:14.790,Y... Yes.
00:23:16.220,00:23:18.460,前几日臣妾和熹妃惠嫔,00:23:15.420,00:23:18.453,"A few days ago, Consort Lumière, Concubine Vertu
and I went to visit Consort Honnête."
00:23:18.850,00:23:19.560,去看望端妃,00:23:18.620,00:23:20.655,We happened to come across Su Peisheng.
00:23:19.850,00:23:21.590,正好碰上苏培盛给我们请安,,,
00:23:22.020,00:23:24.560,结果从苏公公的袖口里,00:23:21.220,00:23:23.620,"When... he was bowing to us,"
00:23:24.900,00:23:25.930,掉出了这个东西,00:23:23.740,00:23:25.440,this item dropped from his sleeve.
00:23:27.030,00:23:27.940,宫女的东西,00:23:26.060,00:23:29.020,The belongings of a maid mustn’t be kept closely by a eunuch.
00:23:28.190,00:23:30.020,是不能被太监贴身收着的,,,
00:23:31.660,00:23:33.610,单凭一个缨络也说明不了什么,00:23:30.760,00:23:32.695,Just a knot can’t indicate anything.
00:23:34.830,00:23:36.070,许是槿汐丢了,00:23:34.030,00:23:35.300,Perhaps Jinxi lost this item
00:23:36.410,00:23:37.700,正好叫苏培盛给检着了,00:23:35.300,00:23:37.000,and Su Peisheng happened to have picked it up.
00:23:38.160,00:23:39.490,还打算日后还给她呢,00:23:37.180,00:23:38.686,Perhaps he was planning to return it to her.
00:23:39.870,00:23:42.660,单凭一个缨络倒也是说不出什么,00:23:38.840,00:23:41.400,A tassel knot is not enough evidence.
00:23:43.130,00:23:46.210,可是柳叶合心是什么意思,00:23:42.180,00:23:45.200,But what do the coupling willow leaves mean?
00:23:46.630,00:23:48.590,熹妃你应该知道,00:23:45.600,00:23:47.560,"Consort Lumière, you should know that."
00:23:50.260,00:23:51.710,这事既已露出了端倪,00:23:49.460,00:23:51.000,"As the clue has emerged,"
00:23:52.090,00:23:53.550,本宫就不能坐视不理,00:23:51.000,00:23:52.631,I can’t pretend to not have noticed.
00:23:54.260,00:23:56.840,今日既然来了 未免落人口实,00:23:53.378,00:23:57.071,"While we’re all here today, it’s necessary to search Cui Jinxi’s room -"
00:23:57.180,00:23:58.090,也为了彻查,,,
00:23:58.640,00:24:01.380,少不得要查查崔槿汐的房间,00:23:57.600,00:24:00.918,"to investigate thoroughly, and also to avoid material for gossip."
00:24:02.770,00:24:04.180,槿汐是臣妾身边的人,00:24:01.800,00:24:03.320,Jinxi is my personal maid.
00:24:04.940,00:24:07.060,这事就不劳皇后娘娘动手了,00:24:04.080,00:24:06.260,Your Majesty need not exert yourself.
00:24:07.520,00:24:08.600,臣妾来做就是,00:24:06.620,00:24:07.700,Please allow me instead.
00:24:09.030,00:24:11.310,你有了身孕怎么好做这样的事,00:24:08.080,00:24:10.510,How can you do such things carrying a baby?
00:24:11.900,00:24:14.440,再说熹妃你也要避嫌才好啊,00:24:10.920,00:24:13.340,"Furthermore, you’d better avert suspicion."
00:24:16.450,00:24:17.910,绘春 剪秋,00:24:15.500,00:24:17.110,"Spring, Autumn."
00:24:18.790,00:24:21.320,去查一查崔槿汐的房间,00:24:17.990,00:24:20.360,Examine Cui Jinxi’s room.
00:24:21.830,00:24:24.240,不要错失也不容放过,00:24:20.900,00:24:23.140,Don’t miss a single thing.
00:24:24.750,00:24:25.960,是娘娘,00:24:23.840,00:24:24.960,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:24:29.920,00:24:32.660,熹妃啊 你是有身子的人,00:24:28.900,00:24:31.600,"Consort Lumière, you’re pregnant."
00:24:33.050,00:24:34.010,还是坐着吧,00:24:31.960,00:24:32.980,Have a seat.
00:24:34.470,00:24:37.130,且看着她们都能搜到些什么,00:24:33.500,00:24:36.060,Let’s wait and see what they can find.
00:24:42.560,00:24:44.800,搜仔细点哪个角落都不许放过,00:24:41.540,00:24:43.840,Search carefully. Don’t miss any corners!
00:24:45.100,00:24:45.840,是,00:24:44.120,00:24:44.773,Yes.
00:25:08.340,00:25:09.200,剪秋姑姑,00:25:07.280,00:25:08.260,Madam Autumn.
,,,00:25:13.900,00:25:15.689,Such filth defiling the harem!
00:25:14.930,00:25:18.010,当真是秽乱后宫你们瞧瞧,00:25:16.066,00:25:17.528,You should all take a look.
00:25:25.850,00:25:28.720,他们两个都是宫里的老人了,00:25:24.820,00:25:27.680,They are both senior servants in the palace.
00:25:29.480,00:25:31.470,怎么可能还做出这些事情,00:25:28.500,00:25:30.670,How could they have done such a thing?
00:25:32.740,00:25:34.150,为防上行下效,00:25:31.760,00:25:33.600,"To prevent their juniors from following the example,"
00:25:34.700,00:25:36.230,本宫不能不处置他们,00:25:33.680,00:25:35.430,I can’t leave them unpunished.
00:25:41.830,00:25:43.570,臣妾冒昧恳求皇后娘娘,00:25:41.040,00:25:42.726,I boldly entreat a favor from Your Majesty.
00:25:44.250,00:25:45.660,槿汐是臣妾身边的人,00:25:43.260,00:25:44.860,Jinxi is my close servant.
00:25:46.000,00:25:47.830,不如就交由臣妾来处置吧,00:25:45.200,00:25:47.181,May Your Majesty entrust her punishment to me?
00:25:49.040,00:25:51.630,熹妃身边的人就是后宫的人,00:25:48.240,00:25:50.830,Your servants belong to the harem.
00:25:52.090,00:25:52.830,后宫的人,00:25:51.290,00:25:53.779,I can't remain uninvolved in any affair within the harem.
00:25:53.170,00:25:54.580,本宫就不可以坐视不理,,,
00:25:55.670,00:25:58.670,在宫中服侍的人必须自身检点,00:25:54.720,00:25:57.420,The palace servants must always show discretion.
00:25:58.930,00:26:00.210,存天理 灭人欲,00:25:57.480,00:25:59.600,“Observe Heaven's laws and eliminate human desires.”
00:26:00.680,00:26:01.920,才能安心侍主,00:25:59.640,00:26:01.217,That's how they can devote themselves to their masters.
00:26:02.970,00:26:05.590,否则不知要生出多少乱子来,00:26:02.260,00:26:04.790,"Otherwise, how much trouble would arise?"
00:26:06.270,00:26:08.880,熹妃你还是以大局为重吧,00:26:05.280,00:26:07.880,"Consort Lumière, you’d better think of the greater good."
00:26:10.190,00:26:12.100,娘娘是太后皇上眼中的贤后,00:26:09.180,00:26:11.620,"Your Majesty represents virtue in the eyes of
the Empress Dowager and His Majesty"
00:26:12.570,00:26:14.020,又为后宫众人所敬仰,00:26:11.620,00:26:13.522,and is admired by all in the harem.
00:26:14.740,00:26:17.100,想必娘娘一定会秉公处置,00:26:13.940,00:26:16.300,I believe Your Majesty will uphold justice
00:26:17.820,00:26:20.440,既保住皇家颜面又能清肃后宫,00:26:16.860,00:26:19.640,to protect the royal prestige while restoring discipline in the palace.
00:26:21.200,00:26:22.060,那是自然,00:26:20.200,00:26:21.433,I certainly will.
00:26:22.740,00:26:24.450,本宫是六宫之主,00:26:21.860,00:26:23.340,I am the master of the harem.
00:26:25.080,00:26:28.450,怎能不秉公办理以安人心呢,00:26:24.100,00:26:27.420,I must administer justice and bring peace to everyone.
00:26:33.300,00:26:36.630,熹妃你还是好好地安胎吧,00:26:32.500,00:26:35.830,"Consort Lumière, you just mind your pregnancy."
00:26:38.510,00:26:40.050,臣妾恭送皇后娘娘,00:26:37.710,00:26:39.250,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:26:46.350,00:26:47.970,皇后果然耐不住了,00:26:45.550,00:26:47.170,The empress has finally made a move.
00:26:49.560,00:26:51.100,小主你不怕吗,00:26:48.760,00:26:50.488,"My Lady, aren't you afraid?"
00:26:51.810,00:26:52.470,怕,00:26:51.010,00:26:51.858,Afraid?
00:26:53.230,00:26:55.770,我若是害怕由着她拉下槿汐,00:26:52.208,00:26:54.782,"If I'm afraid and let her drag Jinxi down,"
00:26:56.070,00:26:56.770,下一个就是你,00:26:54.970,00:26:56.234,the next one will be you.
00:26:57.400,00:26:58.360,再就是我自己,00:26:56.600,00:26:57.560,"And then, myself."
00:26:58.990,00:26:59.940,一个都跑不了,00:26:58.190,00:26:59.253,No one would escape.
00:27:00.950,00:27:02.030,槿汐现在被抓了,00:27:00.150,00:27:01.440,"Now that Jinxi is detained,"
00:27:02.700,00:27:03.780,这件事情要是闹大了,00:27:01.712,00:27:04.137,"if this matter escalates, what shall we do?"
00:27:03.990,00:27:04.820,该如何是好,,,
00:27:05.290,00:27:06.450,这件事情一旦传出,00:27:04.490,00:27:05.763,"If gossip spreads,"
00:27:07.080,00:27:08.540,不仅槿汐今后没法做人,00:27:06.054,00:27:08.042,"not only will it cast a shadow on Jinxi's life,"
00:27:09.000,00:27:10.410,就连小主你的清誉也会,00:27:08.200,00:27:09.610,"but also your reputation, My Lady..."
00:27:10.830,00:27:12.320,这个时候是我的清誉要紧,00:27:10.030,00:27:11.520,"At this point, does my reputation matter"
00:27:12.630,00:27:13.660,还是槿汐的性命要紧,00:27:11.830,00:27:12.860,more than Jinxi's life?
00:27:16.050,00:27:19.000,无论如何 我一定要保住槿汐,00:27:15.250,00:27:18.200,Whatever it takes - I must save Jinxi.
00:27:23.970,00:27:25.430,皇上 熹妃来了,00:27:23.170,00:27:24.600,"Your Majesty, Consort Lumière is here."
00:27:28.980,00:27:30.090,皇上万福金安,00:27:28.180,00:27:29.510,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:27:30.310,00:27:31.770,快快快免礼坐,00:27:29.510,00:27:30.970,"No bowing, sit."
00:27:43.200,00:27:45.410,你见你师傅当差也不是头一日了,00:27:42.400,00:27:44.610,It's not as if this is your first day following your shifu.
00:27:45.990,00:27:46.900,怎么到了你自己,00:27:45.061,00:27:47.182,How can you be so careless on your own?
00:27:47.240,00:27:48.480,就毛手毛脚起来了,,,
00:27:49.200,00:27:51.070,朕喝的茶都是八分烫,00:27:48.133,00:27:50.003,I drink my tea hot.
00:27:51.830,00:27:54.540,这都凉成七分了茶香都淡了,00:27:51.030,00:27:53.740,This is already cold and I can hardly smell the aroma.
00:27:55.170,00:27:56.830,奴才该死奴才该死,00:27:54.370,00:27:56.030,My offense deserves death.
00:27:57.840,00:27:59.870,皇上 小厦子才几岁,00:27:57.040,00:27:59.070,"Your Majesty, Xiao-Xiazi is very young."
00:28:00.220,00:28:01.200,皇上也跟他生气,00:27:59.320,00:28:00.626,Please don't get angry with him.
00:28:01.680,00:28:02.660,多历练就好了,00:28:00.880,00:28:02.011,He'll get better over time.
00:28:03.220,00:28:04.880,小厦子再添壶热水来,00:28:02.420,00:28:04.080,"Xiao-Xiazi, bring another pot of hot water."
00:28:05.350,00:28:05.880,嘛,00:28:04.550,00:28:05.080,Yes.
00:28:07.720,00:28:08.760,苏培盛不在,00:28:06.920,00:28:08.040,Su Peisheng is not here.
00:28:09.310,00:28:10.640,这帮人都失了规矩,00:28:08.510,00:28:09.840,All these people stopped behaving themselves.
00:28:11.560,00:28:13.100,没有一件事能做好的,00:28:10.760,00:28:12.413,They cannot do a single thing well.
00:28:14.860,00:28:17.440,一群好马也得有识途的老马带着,00:28:14.060,00:28:16.320,A herd of good horses need to be led by
00:28:17.770,00:28:18.760,才能走得平稳顺畅,00:28:16.320,00:28:18.281,an old one to walk steadily and smoothly.
00:28:19.480,00:28:20.520,何况是他们这些,00:28:18.680,00:28:20.000,"Even more so these servants,"
00:28:20.940,00:28:22.350,向来听盼咐做事的人,00:28:20.000,00:28:21.550,who are used to taking orders.
00:28:24.410,00:28:26.740,现下苏培盛犯了事被拘着,00:28:23.610,00:28:25.940,"Now that Su Peisheng is detained,"
00:28:27.490,00:28:29.610,他们自然像无头苍蝇一般乱转了,00:28:26.690,00:28:28.810,"no wonder they're like ""headless flies."""
00:28:30.040,00:28:31.570,皇后已经跟朕说了,00:28:29.240,00:28:30.770,The Empress has spoken with me
00:28:32.080,00:28:33.740,苏培盛和崔槿汐的事,00:28:31.280,00:28:32.940,about Su Peisheng and Cui Jinxi.
00:28:34.670,00:28:35.910,原本怕你难过,00:28:33.870,00:28:35.450,"I was worried you might be upset,"
00:28:36.250,00:28:38.290,朕打算看完这些折子去看你,00:28:35.450,00:28:37.490,so I was planning to visit you after reviewing these memorandums.
00:28:38.630,00:28:39.370,你倒先来了,00:28:37.490,00:28:38.834,You brought yourself here already.
00:28:39.960,00:28:41.330,臣妾没有约束好宫人,00:28:39.160,00:28:40.530,It's my fault that
00:28:41.920,00:28:43.000,是臣妾的不是,00:28:41.120,00:28:42.351,I didn't discipline my servants well.
00:28:44.970,00:28:46.080,若如你所说,00:28:43.944,00:28:45.318,If what you say is the case --
00:28:47.100,00:28:49.880,苏培盛是自幼在朕身边服侍的人,00:28:46.122,00:28:49.080,"Su Peisheng started to serve me when I was young,"
00:28:50.600,00:28:53.310,那朕是不是更不会管教和约束了,00:28:49.720,00:28:52.510,doesn't that mean I also cannot discipline the servants?
00:28:54.900,00:28:56.350,他们自己做错的事,00:28:54.100,00:28:55.550,They did what they did.
00:28:57.020,00:28:59.350,朕与你都无可奈何,00:28:56.220,00:28:58.550,There was nothing we could have done about it.
00:29:00.860,00:29:01.970,出了这样的事,00:29:00.060,00:29:01.283,"After what has happened,"
00:29:02.900,00:29:05.940,臣妾心里是半点着落也没有,00:29:02.100,00:29:05.140,"my heart has been unsettled, as if hanging in the air."
00:29:06.990,00:29:08.070,槿汐虽有错,00:29:06.190,00:29:07.609,"Even though Jinxi made a mistake,"
00:29:08.870,00:29:11.950,可她毕竟服侍了臣妾这么多年了,00:29:08.070,00:29:11.150,she has served me for so many years after all.
00:29:13.290,00:29:16.080,臣妾是又生气又心疼,00:29:12.490,00:29:15.280,I'm angry but worried about her at the same time.
00:29:16.330,00:29:18.620,你如今是有身孕的人,00:29:15.530,00:29:17.820,You're with child now.
00:29:19.290,00:29:22.000,凡事都要以身孕为紧,00:29:18.490,00:29:21.200,You need to give priority to your pregnancy.
00:29:23.130,00:29:24.710,皇后的身子渐好了,00:29:22.330,00:29:23.910,The Empress's health is getting better.
00:29:25.300,00:29:27.840,后宫的事就交由她看着,00:29:24.500,00:29:27.040,She can attend to the harem affairs now.
00:29:28.640,00:29:29.470,话说回来了,00:29:27.840,00:29:28.821,"Besides,"
00:29:30.060,00:29:32.050,你若是真舍不得崔槿汐,00:29:29.126,00:29:31.116,"if you're upset about losing Cui Jinxi,"
00:29:32.520,00:29:35.380,朕叫内务府再给你挑个更好的,00:29:31.542,00:29:34.580,I'll ask the Household Department to send you someone better.
00:29:39.940,00:29:42.150,小主方才怎么不开口求求皇上,00:29:39.140,00:29:41.463,"My Lady, why didn't you plead with His Majesty?"
00:29:42.690,00:29:44.900,如今能压住皇后的只有皇上了,00:29:41.890,00:29:44.100,Only His Majesty can command the Empress now.
00:29:45.240,00:29:46.150,皇后有备而来,00:29:44.440,00:29:46.747,The Empress came well prepared and got solid evidence.
00:29:46.490,00:29:47.600,切切实实拿住了把柄,,,
00:29:48.070,00:29:48.980,又有宫规压着,00:29:47.092,00:29:49.739,"With the harem rules in place, His Majesty cannot say much."
00:29:49.280,00:29:50.320,皇上也不能说什么,,,
00:29:51.080,00:29:52.030,若本宫去求,00:29:50.000,00:29:53.480,"If I begged His Majesty, I'd be inviting myself
into the Empress's ""burning charcoal urn."""
00:29:52.540,00:29:53.820,皇后正好请君入瓮,,,
00:29:54.410,00:29:56.120,治本宫一个庇护纵容之罪,00:29:53.610,00:29:55.320,She'd find me guilty for conniving and indulgence.
00:29:56.830,00:29:57.790,那可如何是好,00:29:55.960,00:29:57.178,What do we do then?
00:29:58.170,00:29:59.450,如果小主也受牵连的话,00:29:57.240,00:29:58.763,"If you're implicated, My Lady,"
00:30:00.000,00:30:01.460,那更没有人救槿汐他们了,00:29:59.200,00:30:00.660,there's no one else that can save Jinxi.
00:30:03.880,00:30:04.870,咱们去慎刑司,00:30:03.080,00:30:04.334,Let's go to the Department of Penalty.
00:30:05.970,00:30:07.330,慎刑司那地方闷热异常,00:30:05.170,00:30:06.530,It's very stuffy and hot there.
00:30:07.630,00:30:09.220,娘娘怀着身孕怎么能去那儿呢,00:30:06.830,00:30:09.621,"How can Your Highness go there while you're pregnant?
Your Highness should avoid it."
00:30:09.550,00:30:10.420,还是避忌着点好,,,
00:30:11.100,00:30:13.010,本宫连冷宫都出入这么多回了,00:30:10.300,00:30:12.210,I've even been to the Cold Palace - so many times.
00:30:13.390,00:30:14.800,区区一个慎刑司怕什么,00:30:12.412,00:30:13.973,What's there to be afraid of in the Department of Penalty?
00:30:15.140,00:30:16.430,娘娘怀着身孕本就辛苦,00:30:14.340,00:30:15.630,It's already tiring for Your Ladyship carrying the baby.
00:30:16.770,00:30:17.760,即使不为自己打算,00:30:15.970,00:30:17.073,"Even if you aren't concerned for yourself,"
00:30:18.100,00:30:18.810,也要替小阿哥,00:30:17.200,00:30:19.706,"you should protect the little prince
from the vile qi of the Department of Penalty."
00:30:19.150,00:30:20.310,档一档慎刑司的煞气呀,00:30:19.706,00:30:21.004,"If he cannot overcome this little hardship,"
00:30:20.690,00:30:21.800,若这点闷热都受不住,,,
00:30:22.770,00:30:23.890,怎么做本宫的孩儿,00:30:21.792,00:30:23.176,how can he be my child?
00:30:24.820,00:30:25.560,去就是了,00:30:24.020,00:30:24.873,Let's go.
00:30:36.500,00:30:37.700,好好干活别偷懒,00:30:35.700,00:30:36.900,"Do your work, don't get lazy!"
00:30:38.290,00:30:39.620,到这儿你还想偷懒,00:30:37.490,00:30:38.820,It's not a place for you slack off!
,,,00:30:39.410,00:30:40.280,What are you doing?!
00:30:40.210,00:30:40.790,干什么呢,00:30:40.280,00:30:41.183,It's warm here.
00:30:41.080,00:30:41.870,这里倒暖和,,,
00:30:42.920,00:30:44.280,怎么用这么厚的被褥呢,00:30:42.120,00:30:43.480,Why do they use such thick quilts?
00:30:45.170,00:30:46.500,用这样厚的被褥和干草,00:30:44.370,00:30:46.080,It's one punishment in the Department of Penalty
00:30:46.880,00:30:48.290,也是慎刑司刑罚的一种,00:30:46.080,00:30:47.490,to use the quilts and hay here.
00:30:48.930,00:30:49.660,本就苦热,00:30:47.908,00:30:50.756,"It's unbearably hot already;
sleeping here easily gives people heat rash."
00:30:49.970,00:30:51.420,这样更是要捂出一身痱子来,,,
00:30:51.760,00:30:53.220,但到了冬天滴水成冰的时候,00:30:50.960,00:30:53.950,"But when it's ice-cold in winter,
only thin blankets are provided."
00:30:53.600,00:30:54.550,晚上就只给薄被了,,,
00:30:54.970,00:30:55.840,活活冻死的也有,00:30:54.170,00:30:55.492,Some have frozen to death.
00:30:56.640,00:30:58.100,姑姑多半在那儿舂米受刑呢,00:30:55.640,00:30:57.451,Jinxi is probably pounding rice as her punishment.
00:30:59.440,00:31:00.680,凡是入了慎刑司的人,00:30:58.640,00:31:00.182,Detainers in the Department of Penalty
00:31:01.190,00:31:02.180,每日只睡两个时辰,00:31:00.390,00:31:01.832,"can only sleep four hours per day,"
00:31:02.810,00:31:04.650,余下的时间都要不停地舂米,00:31:02.010,00:31:03.850,and have to pound rice non-stop all the time.
00:31:05.980,00:31:07.570,好好干活 别偷懒,00:31:05.180,00:31:06.770,"Do your work, don't be lazy!"

00:31:37.140,00:31:38.930,奴婢不知道熹妃娘娘过来,00:31:36.340,00:31:38.130,I didn't know Your Highness Consort Lumière was coming.
00:31:39.310,00:31:40.520,奴婢给娘娘请安,00:31:38.510,00:31:39.833,I bid peace to Your Highness.
00:31:40.810,00:31:42.050,有没有一个叫崔槿汐的,00:31:40.010,00:31:41.250,Is someone named Cui Jinxi here?
00:31:42.600,00:31:44.340,有有有 刚来的,00:31:41.800,00:31:43.540,"Yes yes, she just got here."
00:31:44.770,00:31:45.680,在那边舂米呢,00:31:43.970,00:31:45.144,She's pounding rice over there.
00:31:46.650,00:31:47.980,姑姑看看方不方便,00:31:45.850,00:31:47.180,"Madam, is it convenient"
00:31:48.320,00:31:49.350,让本宫跟她说几句话,00:31:47.520,00:31:48.701,for me to have a few words with her?
00:31:49.690,00:31:50.430,方便方便,00:31:48.890,00:31:49.630,Yes yes.
00:31:50.740,00:31:52.150,您等着奴婢给您叫去,00:31:49.940,00:31:51.350,"Please wait here, I'll call her over."
00:31:52.780,00:31:54.070,崔槿汐过来,00:31:51.980,00:31:53.270,"Cui Jinxi, come here!"
00:31:59.540,00:32:01.120,娘娘您慢慢说吧,00:31:58.740,00:32:00.320,"Your Highness, please take your time."
00:32:01.540,00:32:03.080,奴婢去那边看着点去,00:32:00.740,00:32:02.280,I'll just be watching others over there.
00:32:04.000,00:32:04.710,多谢,00:32:03.200,00:32:03.910,Thank you.
00:32:08.300,00:32:09.160,你们怎么来了,00:32:07.500,00:32:08.360,Why are you all here?
00:32:10.050,00:32:11.040,慢腾腾的 还不好好干活,00:32:09.250,00:32:10.240,"(So slow, faster!)"
00:32:11.260,00:32:13.420,娘娘怀着身孕 怎可来这种地方,00:32:10.460,00:32:12.620,How could Your Highness come here while pregnant?
00:32:13.840,00:32:17.090,我打死你 你个贱人 干什么呢,00:32:14.419,00:32:16.320,(I'll beat you to death. What are you doing?)
00:32:22.980,00:32:25.090,都怪奴婢连累了娘娘,00:32:22.180,00:32:24.290,It's my fault to have implicated Your Highness...
00:32:25.440,00:32:26.470,害您来这种脏地方,00:32:24.640,00:32:25.972,and made you come to this foul place.
00:32:27.570,00:32:28.770,不过外边也少不得,00:32:26.770,00:32:28.121,I suppose... many are
00:32:29.150,00:32:30.480,有人在笑话娘娘吧,00:32:28.350,00:32:30.000,laughing at Your Highness outside.
00:32:31.530,00:32:34.740,奴婢真是真是无颜再见您了,00:32:30.730,00:32:33.978,I'm so ashamed ... I don't deserve to see Your Highness again.
00:32:36.370,00:32:37.450,你若连累了我,00:32:35.570,00:32:36.876,"If you had implicated me,"
00:32:38.620,00:32:39.900,我还如何能来看你,00:32:37.632,00:32:39.515,how could I have come here to see you?
00:32:41.290,00:32:43.900,倒是你 当初一心为我,00:32:40.490,00:32:43.100,"Back then, you did this wholeheartedly for me,"
00:32:44.620,00:32:47.290,却让你落到今日这样的地步,00:32:43.820,00:32:46.490,and now you have ended up here...
00:32:48.920,00:32:50.130,总是我对不住你,00:32:48.120,00:32:49.330,I owe it to you.
00:32:51.210,00:32:51.920,你别急,00:32:50.410,00:32:51.384,Don't worry.
00:32:52.880,00:32:54.590,我一定会想法子救你出去的,00:32:52.080,00:32:53.790,I will find a way to get you out of here.
00:32:55.390,00:32:57.750,不不不 娘娘您现在有孕在身,00:32:54.368,00:32:56.728,"No no, Your Highness is pregnant."
00:32:58.180,00:32:59.260,万不能劳心伤神,00:32:57.202,00:32:58.546,You must not exert your mind.
00:33:00.020,00:33:01.470,万一动了胎气可不好,00:32:59.042,00:33:00.831,It could affect the prenatal qi.
00:33:02.980,00:33:05.640,其实奴婢早就知道,00:33:01.958,00:33:04.618,I knew from the beginning
00:33:06.150,00:33:07.230,此事万一事发,00:33:05.350,00:33:06.732,"that if this was found out,"
00:33:07.810,00:33:08.850,必定不得善果,00:33:07.010,00:33:08.276,it wouldn't end well.
00:33:10.190,00:33:11.310,更何况此事,00:33:09.390,00:33:10.661,Not to mention that...
00:33:12.110,00:33:14.070,是被皇后娘娘抓在手心里,00:33:11.310,00:33:13.270,this has been firmly grasped by the Empress.
00:33:15.240,00:33:15.980,再说,00:33:14.440,00:33:15.180,"Also,"
00:33:16.700,00:33:18.360,就算是娘娘费尽心力,00:33:15.900,00:33:18.701,"even if Your Highness tried very hard to save me,"
00:33:18.700,00:33:19.610,把奴婢救了出去,,,
00:33:20.330,00:33:21.110,在这宫中,00:33:19.530,00:33:20.649,I'd be too ashamed to
00:33:21.830,00:33:23.570,奴婢也不知该如何做人了,00:33:21.030,00:33:22.770,keep living in the palace.
00:33:24.580,00:33:26.950,不如就让奴婢在此自生自灭吧,00:33:23.780,00:33:26.338,It's better to just let my life take its course here...
,,,00:33:26.338,00:33:27.118,Jinxi.
00:33:27.380,00:33:28.160,槿汐,00:33:27.620,00:33:28.320,Your Highness.
00:33:28.420,00:33:29.120,娘娘,,,
00:33:32.710,00:33:34.630,此番回宫实属不易呀,00:33:31.910,00:33:33.920,it was really difficult to return to the palace.
00:33:35.720,00:33:37.250,您可要以大局为重,00:33:34.920,00:33:36.450,You need to consider the big picture.
00:33:37.640,00:33:38.840,舍奴婢一个不怕的,00:33:36.840,00:33:38.400,It's all right to sacrifice me.
00:33:40.260,00:33:41.250,你好生地自保,00:33:39.460,00:33:40.450,Protect yourself
00:33:42.390,00:33:44.380,平平安安地把孩子生下来,00:33:41.590,00:33:43.580,and give birth to the child safely.
00:33:45.730,00:33:47.010,奴婢死而无憾,00:33:44.930,00:33:46.285,Then I'd die with no regret.
00:33:47.850,00:33:49.220,死是最容易的事情,00:33:47.050,00:33:48.420,Death is the easiest way out.
00:33:50.820,00:33:52.180,一脖子吊上去就完了,00:33:50.020,00:33:51.606,Just hang oneself and then it's over.
00:33:53.490,00:33:56.600,可是你这样做是亲者痛 仇者快,00:33:52.690,00:33:56.111,"But if you did that, it would ""sadden the allies
and gladden the enemies."""
00:33:57.450,00:33:58.110,不值得,00:33:56.650,00:33:57.649,It's not worth it.
,,,00:33:59.820,00:34:01.521,"Given our relationship all these years,"
00:34:00.620,00:34:03.700,以我们多年的情分 你信我,00:34:02.010,00:34:03.040,"trust me,"
00:34:04.790,00:34:05.990,我一定会救你出去的,00:34:03.723,00:34:05.280,I'll get you out of here.
00:34:11.250,00:34:12.710,慎刑司这种地方,00:34:10.450,00:34:11.910,"But Your Highness,"
00:34:14.550,00:34:16.040,娘娘就不要再来了吧,00:34:13.750,00:34:15.579,please don't come to this foul place again.
00:34:17.300,00:34:19.170,奴婢一定好生照顾自己,00:34:16.500,00:34:18.370,I will take good care of myself.
00:34:21.680,00:34:23.140,你知道如今苏培盛在哪儿,00:34:20.880,00:34:22.566,Do you know where Su Peisheng is now?
00:34:26.100,00:34:28.840,左不过和奴婢一样,00:34:25.300,00:34:28.040,"I suppose the same as me,"
00:34:30.400,00:34:31.560,在哪里受刑罢了,00:34:29.600,00:34:31.439,he's being punished somewhere.
00:34:33.070,00:34:34.430,也是奴婢连累了他,00:34:32.270,00:34:33.630,I dragged him down...
00:34:35.400,00:34:36.110,要不,00:34:34.600,00:34:35.687,"Otherwise,"
00:34:36.650,00:34:38.770,他必定好生地做他的首领太监,00:34:35.850,00:34:37.970,he'd still be the palace's head eunuch.
00:34:40.950,00:34:42.360,其实对于苏培盛,00:34:40.150,00:34:41.560,I didn't have much expectation
00:34:43.620,00:34:45.980,奴婢原本也不作他想的,00:34:42.820,00:34:44.468,about Su Peisheng.
00:34:47.830,00:34:48.700,只是两个人,00:34:46.763,00:34:48.048,Just that the two of us...
00:34:50.330,00:34:51.820,互相利用互相依靠地,00:34:49.263,00:34:52.320,could have each other to rely on for the rest of our lives.
00:34:52.170,00:34:53.330,好好过日子罢了,,,
00:34:54.460,00:34:56.200,谁知道那日在慎刑司,00:34:53.660,00:34:55.702,"But the other day, at the Department of Penalty,"
00:34:57.220,00:34:59.380,他竟怎么拷打也不说出奴婢来,00:34:56.420,00:34:58.580,he didn't inform against me despite all the torture.
00:35:01.390,00:35:04.300,奴婢倒倒多出几分真心来,00:35:00.590,00:35:03.500,That gave me ... some true feelings for him.
00:35:05.350,00:35:06.430,患难见真情,00:35:04.550,00:35:05.856,"""Misfortune reveals the true heart."""
00:35:07.730,00:35:08.590,也实在难得,00:35:06.930,00:35:08.016,It's truly rare.
00:35:10.150,00:35:11.850,以前奴婢看您和他,00:35:09.350,00:35:11.050,"Back then, looking at you and him..."
00:35:16.570,00:35:17.480,倒觉得,00:35:15.431,00:35:17.270,"I thought you were the ideal couple,"
00:35:18.070,00:35:20.400,只是一对郎才女貌的璧人罢了,00:35:17.270,00:35:19.600,"""a talented man and a beautiful woman."""
00:35:21.240,00:35:22.820,现如今自己经历了,00:35:20.327,00:35:22.359,"Now that I have experienced the feelings myself,"
00:35:23.910,00:35:27.200,才知道什么叫患难见真情,00:35:23.110,00:35:26.400,"I finally understand how ""Misfortune reveals the true heart."""
00:35:28.500,00:35:29.280,你放心,00:35:27.700,00:35:28.631,Don't worry.
00:35:30.960,00:35:32.790,苏培盛那边我会打点好,00:35:30.160,00:35:32.216,I'll make sure he is taken care of as well.
00:35:35.090,00:35:36.080,你自己要保重,00:35:34.112,00:35:35.366,You must take care of yourself.
00:35:37.960,00:35:38.750,我没事,00:35:36.849,00:35:37.639,I'm fine.
00:35:42.390,00:35:44.090,熹妃娘娘驾到,00:35:41.590,00:35:43.290,Her Highness Consort Lumière.
00:35:46.060,00:35:46.720,姐姐,00:35:45.260,00:35:45.920,Honnête.
00:35:47.350,00:35:48.050,妹妹,00:35:46.550,00:35:47.250,Lumière.
00:35:49.100,00:35:50.220,姐姐苦读诗书,00:35:48.300,00:35:49.759,I see that you're reading.
00:35:50.770,00:35:52.680,也不知妹妹来得是不是时候,00:35:49.970,00:35:51.880,I hope this isn't a bad time?
00:35:54.980,00:35:56.600,妹妹宫里出了不小的事,00:35:54.180,00:35:55.800,"After what happened in your palace,"
00:35:57.070,00:35:58.400,难不成这个时候,00:35:56.270,00:35:57.600,I suppose you're not here
00:35:58.690,00:35:59.980,是来与我闲聊说话的,00:35:57.890,00:35:59.180,to chit-chat with me.
00:36:01.110,00:36:02.230,着急见姐姐,00:36:00.310,00:36:01.732,"I'm eager to see you, Honnête."
00:36:02.780,00:36:04.400,也不知姐姐肯不肯帮我,00:36:01.980,00:36:03.600,I wonder if you're willing to help me.
00:36:05.080,00:36:07.070,妹妹可以说来听听 快坐下,00:36:04.200,00:36:06.270,Tell me what you're thinking. Have a seat.
00:36:08.750,00:36:09.480,我呀,,,
00:36:10.290,00:36:12.320,是一心想救槿汐和苏培盛,00:36:09.490,00:36:11.520,My mind is set on saving Jinxi and Su Peisheng.
00:36:13.000,00:36:14.240,自然也是为了皇上,00:36:12.200,00:36:13.440,"Of course, it's also for His Majesty."
00:36:15.540,00:36:17.700,苏培盛在皇上跟前服侍多年,00:36:14.740,00:36:16.900,Su Peisheng has served His Majesty for many years.
00:36:18.760,00:36:20.370,是最清楚皇上脾性的,00:36:17.738,00:36:19.360,He knows His Majesty's temper and habits the best.
00:36:21.590,00:36:22.800,如今乍然被拘,00:36:20.790,00:36:22.339,Now he's suddenly detained.
00:36:23.970,00:36:25.550,一则损伤皇上颜面,00:36:22.992,00:36:24.949,"First, it damages the prestige of His Majesty;"
00:36:26.350,00:36:29.050,二则皇上身边也没有会服侍的人,00:36:25.550,00:36:28.250,"second, no one else can serve His Majesty as attentively,"
00:36:29.810,00:36:31.340,处处不得顺心遂意,00:36:29.010,00:36:30.540,causing His Majesty uneasiness all day.
00:36:32.020,00:36:33.010,妹妹说得是啊,00:36:31.220,00:36:32.210,You're right.
00:36:36.980,00:36:37.770,祺贵人止步,00:36:36.180,00:36:37.460,"Noble Lady Délice, please stop."
00:36:44.780,00:36:47.490,皇后娘娘驾到,00:36:43.980,00:36:46.690,Her Majesty the Empress.
00:36:54.040,00:36:55.620,臣妾给皇后娘娘请安,00:36:53.018,00:36:54.598,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:36:57.460,00:36:58.200,起来吧,00:36:56.660,00:36:57.400,Rise.
00:36:58.750,00:36:59.660,谢皇后娘娘,00:36:57.840,00:36:58.860,I thank Your Majesty.
00:37:02.090,00:37:03.960,皇后娘娘您终于来了,00:37:01.120,00:37:03.160,Your Majesty has finally come.
00:37:04.510,00:37:07.130,臣妾被关在这里可要憋屈死了,00:37:03.710,00:37:06.330,I feel so aggrieved being locked up here.
00:37:08.100,00:37:10.880,这里跟储秀宫比是差得多了,00:37:07.300,00:37:10.080,It does look much worse than the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:37:11.980,00:37:14.390,皇后娘娘臣妾被禁足在这里,00:37:11.180,00:37:13.590,"Your Majesty, I'm being confined here,"
00:37:14.730,00:37:16.090,不知道什么时候才能出去,00:37:13.760,00:37:15.554,and have no idea when I can get out.
00:37:16.520,00:37:18.390,皇上是不是已经忘了臣妾了,00:37:15.720,00:37:17.590,Has His Majesty already forgotten about me?
00:37:18.820,00:37:20.100,你就这么想出去吗,00:37:18.020,00:37:19.300,Do you want to get out so badly?
00:37:23.450,00:37:25.400,皇后娘娘 求您救救臣妾,00:37:22.650,00:37:24.600,"Your Majesty, please save me."
00:37:26.660,00:37:28.110,很快就到中秋了,00:37:25.860,00:37:27.310,Soon it will be the Mid-Autumn Festival.
00:37:28.490,00:37:30.780,本宫会去劝皇上把你放出去,00:37:27.690,00:37:29.980,I'll suggest to His Majesty to end your confinement.
00:37:31.540,00:37:32.620,你也应该知道,00:37:30.740,00:37:31.820,You should know
00:37:33.000,00:37:35.160,要怎么去回报本宫的恩情吧,00:37:32.200,00:37:34.360,how to return my favor.
00:37:35.830,00:37:36.990,臣妾万死不辞,00:37:35.030,00:37:36.740,I'll obey Your Majesty's bidding at all cost.
00:37:37.540,00:37:38.750,即便不为了皇后,00:37:36.740,00:37:37.950,"Even if it's not for Your Majesty,"
00:37:39.340,00:37:42.170,臣妾也知道是谁陷害了臣妾,00:37:38.362,00:37:41.192,I remember for my own sake who framed me.
00:37:45.090,00:37:46.920,皇上驾到,00:37:44.290,00:37:46.120,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:37:47.760,00:37:48.500,皇上来了,00:37:46.960,00:37:47.964,His Majesty is here.
00:37:52.680,00:37:54.090,臣妾见过皇上,00:37:51.880,00:37:53.290,I greet Your Majesty.
00:37:54.350,00:37:55.010,起来吧起来吧,00:37:53.550,00:37:54.210,"Rise, rise."
00:37:58.150,00:37:59.680,你今日气色倒好,00:37:57.350,00:37:58.880,You look better today.
00:37:59.980,00:38:00.940,谢皇上夸奖,00:37:59.180,00:38:00.140,I thank Your Majesty.
00:38:02.690,00:38:05.530,你身子一向弱 也该好好养着,00:38:01.890,00:38:04.843,"You've always been weak.
You should be careful about your health."
,,,00:38:06.200,00:38:08.190,[Mencius]
00:38:08.990,00:38:10.950,怎么有兴致看这个,00:38:08.190,00:38:10.150,What interest do you have in reading this?
00:38:12.700,00:38:14.360,孔孟之道大有深意,00:38:11.900,00:38:13.560,The teachings of Confucius and Mencius are profound.
00:38:15.040,00:38:16.120,臣妾很喜欢,00:38:14.240,00:38:15.320,I enjoy them a lot.
00:38:18.330,00:38:19.450,你既喜欢孟子,00:38:17.530,00:38:18.650,You like Mencius.
00:38:20.250,00:38:21.660,那你有何见解呀,00:38:19.450,00:38:21.011,What's your opinion about his ideas?
00:38:22.710,00:38:23.950,臣妾读孟子,00:38:21.910,00:38:23.150,"Compared with Mencius,"
00:38:24.550,00:38:26.210,方知朱熹之浅薄,00:38:23.750,00:38:25.830,"Zhu Xi seems quite shallow.
[A Confucian scholar in Song Dynasty]"
00:38:26.630,00:38:28.000,朱熹妄称夫子,00:38:25.830,00:38:27.200,"Yet Zhu Xi called himself a Fuzi
[great scholar]."
00:38:28.470,00:38:30.830,虽被后人赞誉为程朱理学,00:38:27.670,00:38:30.030,"Although his studies were renowned as part of the Cheng-Zhu school,"
00:38:31.220,00:38:33.380,其实全然曲解了孔孟之道,00:38:30.420,00:38:32.768,he completely misinterpreted the philosophy of Confucius and Mencius.
00:38:36.270,00:38:37.260,为何这么说呢,00:38:35.470,00:38:36.460,How so?
00:38:38.690,00:38:41.470,孟子讲男女居室人之大伦也,00:38:37.890,00:38:40.670,"Mencius said that ""male and female dwelling together
is the greatest of human relations."""
00:38:41.860,00:38:43.310,可是到了朱熹的嘴中,00:38:41.060,00:38:42.510,But Zhu Xi proposed:
00:38:43.650,00:38:45.640,却说存天理灭人欲,00:38:42.850,00:38:44.840,“Observe Heaven's laws and eliminate human desires.”
00:38:45.940,00:38:47.230,实在大大地不通,00:38:45.140,00:38:46.430,It doesn't flow from Mencius's belief.
00:38:50.410,00:38:53.070,朱熹确有不通人情之处,00:38:49.610,00:38:52.270,Zhu Xi does seem to lack empathy there.
00:38:53.370,00:38:54.450,宫中也是如此啊,00:38:52.570,00:38:53.650,It's also the case in the palace.
00:38:54.950,00:38:56.570,如果按照朱夫子所说,00:38:54.150,00:38:55.770,"If we follow Zhu Fuzi's proposition,"
00:38:57.040,00:38:59.030,那么后妃怎么能够为皇上,00:38:56.240,00:38:58.230,how could the concubines bring
00:38:59.420,00:39:00.250,绵延子嗣呢,00:38:58.230,00:38:59.638,heirs to Your Majesty?
00:39:01.040,00:39:03.830,所以呀 臣妾认为说这样话的人,00:39:00.240,00:39:03.030,"Therefore, I think whoever says something like this"
00:39:04.300,00:39:06.000,必定是一个无情之人,00:39:03.349,00:39:05.200,must be a heartless person.
00:39:07.130,00:39:09.920,与皇家的宽厚之德背道而驰,00:39:06.330,00:39:09.120,It runs counter to the benevolence of the imperial family.
00:39:10.180,00:39:11.090,背道而驰,00:39:09.380,00:39:10.554,The benevolence...
00:39:12.930,00:39:15.800,你最近见过什么人,00:39:12.130,00:39:15.000,Have you seen someone recently?
00:39:16.470,00:39:17.510,听过什么话吗,00:39:15.670,00:39:17.012,Did you hear something?
00:39:20.900,00:39:23.930,皇上 且不说臣妾的身子不适,00:39:20.100,00:39:23.130,"Your Majesty, I'm constantly unwell"
00:39:24.320,00:39:25.050,不能出去,00:39:23.332,00:39:24.401,and only stay in my place.
00:39:25.650,00:39:26.940,即便是能出去,00:39:25.114,00:39:26.404,"Even if I do go out,"
00:39:27.400,00:39:28.610,皇上也是知道的,00:39:26.600,00:39:27.810,Your Majesty knows that
00:39:28.990,00:39:30.820,臣妾是不愿管别人的闲事,00:39:28.190,00:39:30.284,"I'm the person least likely to meddle with the affairs of others,"
00:39:31.530,00:39:33.070,更不爱说别人的闲话,00:39:30.730,00:39:32.270,or gossip about them.
00:39:34.370,00:39:35.030,没错,00:39:33.570,00:39:34.532,That's true.
00:39:35.830,00:39:38.030,朕觉得这是你最大的好处,00:39:35.030,00:39:37.230,It's your best merit in my view.
00:39:39.580,00:39:43.540,如此朕有一事想问问你的意思,00:39:38.780,00:39:42.740,"If so, I'd like to ask your opinion on one thing."
00:39:44.210,00:39:44.820,是,00:39:43.410,00:39:44.020,Yes.
00:39:46.880,00:39:48.870,如今宫中纷传着,00:39:46.080,00:39:48.070,"Currently, the harem is gossiping about"
00:39:49.220,00:39:51.170,崔槿汐和苏培盛之事,00:39:48.420,00:39:50.370,the affair between Cui Jinxi and Su Peisheng.
00:39:52.890,00:39:54.300,皇后主张严惩,00:39:52.090,00:39:53.764,The Empress advises harsh punishment.
00:39:55.260,00:39:56.750,敬妃持中不言,00:39:54.460,00:39:55.950,Consort Estime withdrew her opinion.
00:39:57.140,00:39:58.510,熹妃不便说话,00:39:56.340,00:39:57.710,It's not fitting for Consort Lumière to speak.
00:40:00.020,00:40:01.430,你怎么看,00:39:59.220,00:40:00.630,What do you think?
00:40:03.770,00:40:05.140,宫中美女如花,00:40:02.970,00:40:04.518,The beauties in the palace are like flowers.
00:40:06.730,00:40:08.440,可无人能说哪枝最好,00:40:05.930,00:40:07.828,Nobody can say which flower is the best.
00:40:09.190,00:40:10.600,就比如说桃花吧,00:40:08.390,00:40:10.000,Take the peach blossom as an example.
00:40:11.240,00:40:13.150,喜爱者称为宜室宜家,00:40:10.440,00:40:12.350,"People who like it say it ""brings harmony to a family."""
00:40:13.620,00:40:15.480,不爱者弃之逐水飘零,00:40:12.642,00:40:14.902,"Those who dislike it ""discard them to flow away with the river."""
00:40:16.080,00:40:17.660,其实各花入各眼,00:40:15.280,00:40:17.086,Yet all eyes have seen the same flower.
00:40:18.120,00:40:19.730,是非只在人心罢了,00:40:17.320,00:40:19.419,And right or wrong are determined by the human heart.
00:40:20.790,00:40:21.650,今日之事,00:40:19.990,00:40:21.038,"Regarding this affair,"
00:40:22.330,00:40:23.660,皇后认为是关系到,00:40:21.530,00:40:23.200,the Empress thinks it's related to
00:40:24.000,00:40:25.120,宫中的风纪规矩,00:40:23.200,00:40:24.697,the rules and discipline in the palace;
00:40:25.880,00:40:27.240,臣妾不以为然,00:40:25.080,00:40:26.440,I beg to differ.
00:40:27.670,00:40:29.290,他们并没有祸乱后宫,00:40:26.870,00:40:28.490,They didn't cause any disorder in the harem.
00:40:30.300,00:40:31.660,只是宫女太监们,00:40:29.500,00:40:30.860,It's just a maid and a eunuch
00:40:32.130,00:40:33.670,相互的慰藉罢了,00:40:31.330,00:40:32.870,finding consolation in each other.
00:40:34.300,00:40:37.340,奴才们一进宫便孤身劳作到死,00:40:33.500,00:40:36.615,"The servants, once sent to the palace, work hard until their death."
00:40:38.260,00:40:39.970,难免的凄凉寂寞,00:40:37.460,00:40:39.170,It's inevitable they feel lonely and sorrowful.
00:40:40.430,00:40:41.640,只是想寻个伴,00:40:39.452,00:40:40.862,They just want to find a companion.
00:40:41.940,00:40:45.890,以己度人想想也觉得可怜得很,00:40:41.140,00:40:44.868,I'd feel pitiful if I were in their shoes.
00:40:48.190,00:40:51.100,那你以为该如何处置为好,00:40:47.168,00:40:50.078,How do you think we should resolve this issue then?
00:40:53.660,00:40:55.820,皇上可曾听说过一句话,00:40:52.860,00:40:55.020,"Your Majesty, have you heard this saying:"
00:40:56.660,00:40:58.650,不痴不聋不做家翁,00:40:55.600,00:40:58.438,"""You can't be the man of the house
if you don't have a deaf ear and a blind eye""."
00:40:59.580,00:41:02.320,何况是宫女太监们对食之事,00:40:58.780,00:41:01.520,"It's an ""eat-together relationship"" between a maid and a eunuch."
,,,00:41:02.106,00:41:03.606,If every palace
00:41:03.120,00:41:04.110,皇上要是不信,00:41:03.606,00:41:04.960,"is thoroughly investigated,"
00:41:04.620,00:41:05.990,到每个宫去查一下,00:41:04.960,00:41:06.805,"I imagine Your Majesty can easily find
 many other “eat-together partners."""
00:41:06.460,00:41:07.450,保不定都有,,,
00:41:07.840,00:41:10.250,难道个个都要杀之而后快吗,00:41:07.040,00:41:09.450,Should they all be executed?
00:41:11.170,00:41:13.790,皇上乃一国之君天下之王,00:41:10.370,00:41:12.990,Your Majesty is the Emperor of the country and the ruler under Heaven.
00:41:14.550,00:41:17.130,责任之重大何止是一个家翁,00:41:13.750,00:41:16.330,"You bear much more serious responsibilities than ""the man of the house."""
00:41:17.470,00:41:19.380,大可端出一副容人之量来,00:41:16.670,00:41:18.580,Why not be more tolerant
00:41:19.890,00:41:21.600,大事化小小事化了,00:41:18.580,00:41:21.111,"and ""turn big problems into small ones,
and small problems into no problems at all""?"
00:41:25.900,00:41:28.760,许是臣妾见熹妃和惠嫔,00:41:25.100,00:41:27.960,Perhaps it's because I see Consort Lumière and Concubine Vertu
00:41:29.110,00:41:30.020,都怀有身孕,00:41:28.310,00:41:29.220,"are both pregnant,"
00:41:30.980,00:41:33.600,实在听不得这些打打杀杀的事,00:41:30.180,00:41:32.800,They cannot bear to hear the sounds of beatings and killing.
00:41:35.070,00:41:35.690,是啊,00:41:34.270,00:41:34.890,Yes.
00:41:37.030,00:41:39.110,如今宫中有身孕的不少,00:41:36.230,00:41:38.310,We have some pregnant concubines now.
00:41:39.950,00:41:43.410,大约都是见不得杀生之事的,00:41:39.150,00:41:42.610,I suppose they cannot bear to see any killings.
00:41:46.580,00:41:49.200,好吧你好好歇息,00:41:45.780,00:41:48.400,"All right, you should rest well."
00:41:49.670,00:41:51.280,朕先回养心殿了,00:41:48.870,00:41:50.706,I'm going back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:41:52.960,00:41:54.450,臣妾恭送皇上,00:41:52.160,00:41:53.650,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:40.200,00:42:58.200,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:58.200,00:43:18.200,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:18.200,00:43:35.200,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:35.200,00:43:53.200,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:53.200,00:44:01.200,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:01.200,00:44:13.200,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:13.200,00:44:32.200,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
