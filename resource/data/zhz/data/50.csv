00:02:40.700,00:02:41.440,你曾经对我说,,,
00:02:41.780,00:02:43.440,你对男女之情已经绝望了,00:02:41.410,00:02:44.939,You once told me that you had only despair left for true love.
00:02:44.530,00:02:45.440,你也曾经说过,,,
00:02:45.700,00:02:47.410,你要忘掉一切与宫中有牵连的人,00:02:45.429,00:02:48.985,"You said you were going to
forget everyone connected to the palace."
00:02:49.330,00:02:50.700,可是如今的果郡王呢,00:02:50.238,00:02:52.056,But what now of Noble Prince Guo?
00:02:51.630,00:02:52.540,这你又怎么说,,,
00:02:53.210,00:02:53.870,是,00:02:52.611,00:02:53.985,What do you have to say?
00:02:54.710,00:02:56.120,我曾经是说过这样的话,00:02:54.213,00:02:55.193,You’re right.
00:02:56.380,00:02:58.000,曾经说的话就不算了吗,00:02:55.636,00:02:57.440,I once said such things.
,,,00:02:57.440,00:02:59.460,Don’t your past words count?
00:02:59.590,00:03:01.460,世事变化我们常常始料不及,00:03:00.650,00:03:02.904,Things always change in ways we cannot foresee.
00:03:02.640,00:03:04.220,曾经并不能把它当做永远,00:03:03.742,00:03:05.552,The past doesn't last forever.
00:03:05.430,00:03:08.470,就如曾经我家中鼎盛煌赫,00:03:06.490,00:03:09.840,"Just like my family was in its prime,"
00:03:09.390,00:03:11.100,曾经我是不谙世事的甄嬛,00:03:10.450,00:03:12.913,and I was the Zhen Huan unacquainted with worldly affairs.
00:03:12.150,00:03:13.560,可那都已经是曾经了,00:03:13.210,00:03:15.082,But that is all in the past.
00:03:15.650,00:03:17.480,即便我多么希望它不要过去,00:03:16.533,00:03:18.752,"No matter how much I wish time hadn't passed,"
00:03:18.740,00:03:20.070,可它终究还是过去了,00:03:19.879,00:03:21.323,it did after all.
00:03:20.820,00:03:22.110,我不想听你说这些,00:03:21.777,00:03:23.650,I don’t want to hear you say this.
00:03:24.320,00:03:25.280,你只跟我说,00:03:25.380,00:03:26.420,"Just tell me,"
00:03:26.540,00:03:28.370,你和果郡王到底是怎么回事,00:03:27.475,00:03:29.775,what is there between you and Noble Prince Guo?
00:03:30.410,00:03:33.000,我喜欢他 他也喜欢我,00:03:31.470,00:03:32.709,I love him.
00:03:34.040,00:03:34.830,仅此而已,00:03:33.190,00:03:34.309,"He loves me, too."
,,,00:03:35.017,00:03:35.993,That’s it.
00:03:38.210,00:03:38.920,好啊,00:03:39.270,00:03:39.980,Good.
00:03:40.630,00:03:42.620,事到如今你才跟我说实话,00:03:41.690,00:03:43.859,You haven’t told me the truth until now.
00:03:45.390,00:03:46.970,可为什么偏偏是他呢,00:03:46.481,00:03:48.172,But why him?
00:03:48.930,00:03:50.050,你想知道是为什么,00:03:49.839,00:03:51.461,You want to know why?
00:03:52.310,00:03:54.520,因为我对男女之情绝望,,,
00:03:54.860,00:03:56.520,因为我对我的人生绝望,00:03:53.341,00:03:57.619,"Because in my despair of love and of my life,"
00:03:58.150,00:03:58.940,是允礼,,,
00:04:00.030,00:04:01.520,他开始给了我一点希望,00:03:59.128,00:04:02.680,"it was Yunli who gave me a thread of hope,"
00:04:02.700,00:04:04.400,给了我一线活下去的理由,00:04:03.609,00:04:05.474,and a reason to live on.
00:04:08.030,00:04:09.370,可是你和他在一起,00:04:09.090,00:04:10.588,"But if you are with him,"
00:04:10.160,00:04:12.070,恐怕以后要受的苦不会少,00:04:10.956,00:04:13.461,I’m afraid your future will hold more suffering.
00:04:13.250,00:04:15.790,我受苦他也要受苦,00:04:14.152,00:04:15.379,"When I suffer,"
,,,00:04:15.657,00:04:17.066,he does too.
00:04:17.840,00:04:19.120,我既然愿意跟随他,00:04:18.761,00:04:20.585,"Since I've decided to be with him,"
00:04:20.340,00:04:22.170,自然是想好了会遇到些什么,00:04:21.256,00:04:23.685,I’m fully aware of what will come in the future.
00:04:24.180,00:04:26.040,你怕我所受的辛苦与委屈,00:04:25.122,00:04:27.990,"The hardship and grievances that you’re worried about me suffering,"
00:04:27.220,00:04:30.460,方令我都是心甘情愿的,00:04:28.280,00:04:31.520,I accept with wholehearted willingness.
00:04:35.900,00:04:39.390,心甘情愿好一个心甘情愿,00:04:36.829,00:04:38.578,Wholehearted…
,,,00:04:38.847,00:04:40.677,You said wholehearted ...
00:04:43.860,00:04:47.100,可我对你也是心甘情愿呀,00:04:44.790,00:04:45.689,"But,"
,,,00:04:46.185,00:04:48.171,I’m also wholeheartedly devoted to you.
00:04:47.490,00:04:48.450,那是不一样的,00:04:48.441,00:04:49.727,That’s different.
00:04:50.240,00:04:51.820,你对我好我铭感五内,00:04:50.906,00:04:53.158,My heart is etched with gratitude for you.
00:04:52.540,00:04:55.030,可我与他是两情相悦,00:04:53.600,00:04:56.477,But the love between he and I is mutual.
00:04:57.210,00:04:59.000,哪怕我选择允礼是一个错误,00:04:58.116,00:05:00.463,"Even if it is a mistake to choose Yunli,"
00:05:00.420,00:05:01.830,我也宁愿一错到底,,,
00:05:03.300,00:05:04.210,永不后悔,00:05:01.480,00:05:05.270,I’d rather make this mistake and never feel regret.
00:05:07.550,00:05:08.340,说实话,00:05:08.435,00:05:09.738,"If you're honest,"
00:05:09.600,00:05:11.260,你是觉得和我在一起要紧,00:05:10.660,00:05:12.592,"which do you think is more important,"
00:05:12.310,00:05:13.760,还是我真心安乐要紧,00:05:13.261,00:05:15.308,"to be with me, or my true happiness?"
00:05:17.730,00:05:20.270,说心里话一直以来,00:05:18.425,00:05:19.817,"Honestly,"
00:05:21.150,00:05:23.310,我都希望能够真正地和你在一起,00:05:20.342,00:05:24.370,I have always wanted to be with you.
00:05:25.900,00:05:27.610,可是我连在梦里都知道,,,
00:05:27.990,00:05:29.150,你根本不喜欢我,00:05:26.720,00:05:30.340,"However, even in my dreams
I know you have no affection for me at all."
00:05:29.570,00:05:30.150,你和我在一起,,,
00:05:30.490,00:05:31.980,不会真正地开怀喜乐,00:05:30.630,00:05:33.040,"If you were with me,
you wouldn’t be truly happy."
00:05:34.620,00:05:35.450,那么,00:05:35.499,00:05:36.525,"So then,"
00:05:37.500,00:05:39.870,还是你真正的安乐更要紧些吧,00:05:38.340,00:05:41.030,your true happiness is more important.
00:05:42.670,00:05:44.750,谢谢你 实初哥哥,00:05:43.781,00:05:46.249,"Thank you, Shishu."
00:05:48.010,00:05:49.000,待我这样好,00:05:48.862,00:05:50.556,Thank you for treating me so well.
00:05:55.770,00:05:57.300,他有你的心甘情愿,00:05:56.675,00:05:58.720,He has your wholehearted devotion.
00:05:58.690,00:06:00.270,你不知道我有多羡慕他,00:05:59.619,00:06:01.644,You don't know how much I envy him.
00:06:02.070,00:06:03.560,将来你也会遇到一位,00:06:03.130,00:06:04.808,You too will meet a lady
00:06:04.030,00:06:05.560,真心待你的好女子的,00:06:04.858,00:06:06.723,who loves you with her whole heart.
00:06:25.840,00:06:28.170,看得出温太医他很喜欢你,00:06:26.744,00:06:29.685,"Evidently, Dr. Wen cares for you deeply."
00:06:36.890,00:06:38.180,小主温太医来了,00:06:37.840,00:06:39.574,"My Lady, Dr. Wen is here."
00:06:38.690,00:06:39.520,快请进来,00:06:39.683,00:06:40.700,Send him in.
00:06:43.980,00:06:45.560,微臣给惠嫔娘娘道喜,,,
00:06:45.940,00:06:46.680,你来了,00:06:45.040,00:06:47.000,I congratulate Your Highness Concubine Vertu.
00:06:47.110,00:06:49.520,你明知道我最不在意这些名分的,00:06:47.000,00:06:48.240,Good to see you.
00:06:50.070,00:06:50.860,快起来吧,00:06:48.240,00:06:50.660,You know I care nothing about titles.
00:06:51.200,00:06:51.900,谢小主,00:06:51.130,00:06:52.092,Please rise.
,,,00:06:52.260,00:06:53.299,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:06:54.950,00:06:57.570,这是怎么了 怎么瘦了好些,00:06:56.025,00:06:57.019,What’s wrong?
,,,00:06:57.463,00:06:59.374,You look so much thinner.
00:06:59.540,00:07:00.240,没什么,00:07:00.505,00:07:01.633,Nothing serious.
00:07:09.010,00:07:11.540,到底怎么了 是嬛儿出事了,00:07:10.070,00:07:10.974,What happened?
,,,00:07:10.974,00:07:13.039,Is something wrong with Huan’er?
00:07:12.390,00:07:13.300,嬛儿她没什么,00:07:13.368,00:07:14.408,She is fine.
00:07:15.220,00:07:16.550,只是她不再需要我了,00:07:16.280,00:07:18.221,It's just that she doesn’t need me anymore.
00:07:18.680,00:07:21.020,嬛儿她需要什么她自己知道,00:07:19.740,00:07:22.380,Huan’er knows what she needs.
00:07:21.980,00:07:24.940,可你需要什么你自己可明白吗,00:07:23.040,00:07:26.218,But do you know what you need?
00:07:25.690,00:07:26.770,就是因为明白,00:07:26.686,00:07:28.099,It's because I know what I need
00:07:27.690,00:07:28.930,才知道自己得不到,00:07:28.589,00:07:30.145,that I know I can never have it.
00:07:29.860,00:07:31.070,既然得不到,00:07:30.832,00:07:32.280,"If you can't have it,"
00:07:31.490,00:07:33.100,就不必无谓地伤心了,00:07:32.550,00:07:34.280,there’s no need to grieve.
00:07:34.370,00:07:35.360,说起来容易,00:07:35.317,00:07:36.563,It’s easy to say
00:07:36.490,00:07:37.900,可做起来却太难了,00:07:37.455,00:07:39.059,but hard to do.
00:07:42.170,00:07:43.250,你一个大男人,,,
00:07:43.580,00:07:44.990,怎么变得这样的罗嗦,00:07:43.047,00:07:44.396,You’re a man!
00:07:45.540,00:07:46.780,你若是喜欢她,00:07:44.571,00:07:46.166,Why would you let yourself wallow?
00:07:47.090,00:07:48.580,她喜不喜欢你又何妨,00:07:46.600,00:07:48.112,"If you are devoted to her,"
00:07:48.880,00:07:50.920,你只需执着自己的本心就好,00:07:48.112,00:07:49.786,why does it matter if she loves you back?
00:07:51.550,00:07:52.830,你若是不喜欢她了,00:07:49.940,00:07:52.154,You only need to stay faithful to your own heart.
00:07:53.180,00:07:54.590,坦然放下也就是了,00:07:52.665,00:07:54.240,"If you no longer feel affection for her,"
00:07:54.970,00:07:57.130,又何必把自己弄得这么憔悴难堪,00:07:54.240,00:07:55.884,then gladly let it go.
00:07:57.430,00:07:58.670,白白地惹人笑话,00:07:56.066,00:07:57.928,What's the point of languishing
00:08:01.600,00:08:02.470,微臣从不知道,00:07:58.417,00:08:00.219,and making a fool of yourself?
00:08:02.810,00:08:04.680,端庄持重的惠嫔娘娘说起话来,00:08:02.522,00:08:05.600,I’ve never imagined that the courtly Concubine Vertu
00:08:06.440,00:08:07.550,却如此厉害,00:08:07.366,00:08:08.898,could be so... ferocious.
00:08:11.990,00:08:13.100,不是厉害,00:08:12.957,00:08:14.377,I’m not ferocious.
00:08:16.070,00:08:18.280,只是劝人劝己,00:08:17.036,00:08:19.566,"In saying such things to persuade someone else,"
00:08:19.540,00:08:21.570,都是一样的话,00:08:20.350,00:08:23.006,I am also trying to convince myself.
00:08:30.960,00:08:31.920,看着这水,00:08:31.890,00:08:33.319,"Looking at the water,"
00:08:33.590,00:08:35.800,我便想起昔年在圆明园湖中,,,
00:08:36.140,00:08:37.050,偶遇你的情景,00:08:34.584,00:08:38.508,I think back to our encounter on the lake in the Summer Palace.
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.470,不曾想过还有今天,00:08:40.033,00:08:41.959,I never imagined there would be a day like this.
00:08:41.850,00:08:42.510,是啊,00:08:42.786,00:08:44.051,Neither did I.
00:08:43.560,00:08:45.180,那日你胆子可真够大的,00:08:44.403,00:08:46.403,You were so bold
00:08:46.150,00:08:48.560,敢去偷偷看被禁了足的姐妹,00:08:47.057,00:08:50.000,that you dared to visit your friend in confinement.
00:08:53.780,00:08:55.690,也不知眉姐姐如今怎么样了,00:08:54.840,00:08:57.261,I wonder how Meizhuang is doing.
00:08:58.320,00:09:00.690,她很好才刚晋了惠嫔,00:08:59.380,00:09:02.066,She’s doing well and has just been promoted to Concubine.
00:09:01.700,00:09:02.690,除了去看胧月,00:09:02.760,00:09:03.858,"Except for visiting Longyue,"
00:09:03.710,00:09:05.120,她还是不喜欢与人来往,00:09:04.700,00:09:06.712,she still doesn’t like seeing anyone.
00:09:06.880,00:09:08.120,以姐姐的气性,00:09:07.838,00:09:09.352,That is her nature:
00:09:09.590,00:09:10.950,她是宁愿孤老宫中,00:09:10.481,00:09:12.521,she’d rather age in the palace alone
00:09:11.630,00:09:13.710,也不会再回头向皇上乞怜的,00:09:12.690,00:09:14.845,than beg for His Majesty’s pity.
00:09:15.300,00:09:17.010,只是她还这样年轻美貌,00:09:16.360,00:09:18.571,"But she’s still so young and beautiful,"
00:09:17.800,00:09:18.880,却要郁郁终生,,,
00:09:20.140,00:09:21.000,太可惜了,00:09:18.860,00:09:20.768,yet she has to spend her life in depression.
00:09:23.270,00:09:24.350,你觉得她可惜吗,00:09:21.080,00:09:22.400,What a pity.
00:09:25.560,00:09:26.470,有太后的保护,00:09:24.274,00:09:26.137,You really think it's a pity?
00:09:27.480,00:09:28.940,况且她还是失了宠的人,00:09:26.541,00:09:28.370,She is protected by the Empress Dowager.
00:09:29.940,00:09:31.150,没有人会加害于她,00:09:28.540,00:09:30.376,"And by avoiding His Majesty's favor,"
,,,00:09:31.000,00:09:32.797,no one will have a reason to harm her.
00:09:35.070,00:09:36.440,就如我的胧月一样,00:09:36.130,00:09:38.095,It's the same for my Longyue.
00:09:37.990,00:09:39.780,她不像太子一般惹人注目,00:09:39.050,00:09:41.237,She doesn’t draw attention as a prince does.
00:09:41.830,00:09:44.320,我只希望我的胧月能够平安,00:09:42.729,00:09:45.683,I only hope that Longyue can live in peace.
00:09:45.120,00:09:47.450,皇兄和太后都视她如掌上明珠,00:09:46.018,00:09:49.063,"His Majesty and the Empress Dowager see her as ""a pearl in their palm""."
00:09:48.630,00:09:50.740,何况胧月本身也十分地讨人喜爱,00:09:49.650,00:09:51.954,And Longyue herself is an endearing child.
00:09:51.710,00:09:52.580,你不必担心,00:09:52.699,00:09:53.883,You need not worry.
00:09:54.510,00:09:55.590,每个人都好,00:09:55.570,00:09:56.763,Everyone is doing well.
00:09:57.180,00:09:58.420,你现在需要的只是,00:09:58.184,00:09:59.676,What you need to do now
00:09:59.590,00:10:00.710,好好地爱护自己,00:10:00.650,00:10:02.184,is take care of yourself.
00:10:02.640,00:10:03.300,是,00:10:03.700,00:10:04.586,Yes.
00:10:05.810,00:10:07.170,要好好地爱护自己,00:10:06.870,00:10:08.666,I must take care of myself
00:10:08.350,00:10:11.560,为你也为所有让我牵挂的人,00:10:09.410,00:10:10.730,for you
,,,00:10:10.956,00:10:12.860,and for all those I care about.
00:10:22.740,00:10:23.780,积年旧物了,,,
00:10:24.620,00:10:25.860,还这样贴身藏着呢,00:10:23.579,00:10:25.094,Such an old thing.
00:10:26.660,00:10:27.820,虽然是积年旧物,00:10:25.541,00:10:27.334,You still always keep it with you.
00:10:28.540,00:10:30.120,可是这么些年如果没有它,00:10:27.720,00:10:29.214,Even though it's old，
,,,00:10:29.600,00:10:31.563,"if I didn’t have it all these years,"
00:10:31.290,00:10:33.870,我的心境也不会如此平静,00:10:32.350,00:10:35.252,I wouldn't have been at peace with myself.
00:10:35.840,00:10:37.300,有时候啊我总以为,00:10:36.712,00:10:38.360,"Sometimes, I thought that"
00:10:38.340,00:10:39.630,这辈子能够留下的,00:10:39.312,00:10:41.340,the only thing I could keep in my life
00:10:41.930,00:10:43.260,只有这一枚小像了,00:10:42.846,00:10:44.722,would be this little portrait of you.
00:10:46.930,00:10:49.470,其实在宫中时 我已把你视作知己,00:10:48.098,00:10:51.041,"Back in the palace, I already saw you as my confidant."
00:10:51.560,00:10:53.020,只是我害怕自己的心,00:10:52.532,00:10:54.473,But I was afraid of my heart.
00:10:56.900,00:10:59.270,那么现在你还怕吗,00:10:57.960,00:11:00.330,Are you still afraid now?
00:11:01.610,00:11:02.350,有你在,00:11:02.562,00:11:03.782,With you…
00:11:03.910,00:11:04.770,我什么都不怕,00:11:04.868,00:11:06.223,I'm not afraid of anything.
00:11:10.120,00:11:12.710,皇上敬事房的人来了,00:11:11.180,00:11:13.770,"Your Majesty, Attendant Services is here."
00:11:13.210,00:11:15.170,皇上该翻片卑子了,00:11:14.126,00:11:16.338,"Your Majesty, it's time to select a concubine."
00:11:15.380,00:11:16.460,去延示喜宫,00:11:16.363,00:11:18.188,The Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:11:17.550,00:11:20.710,皇上您这几日除了埋头看摺子,00:11:18.610,00:11:22.080,"Your Majesty, other than burying your head in memorandums these days,"
00:11:21.220,00:11:22.960,去的都是安嫔娘娘那儿,00:11:22.239,00:11:24.215,you've only been visiting Concubine An.
00:11:23.180,00:11:25.590,今儿要不要换换别的小主啊,00:11:24.240,00:11:27.085,Would Your Majesty like to change to another concubine today?
00:11:26.560,00:11:28.340,你胆子越发大了,00:11:27.620,00:11:29.501,You are getting even bolder.
00:11:29.020,00:11:29.850,奴才不敢,00:11:30.010,00:11:31.104,I do not dare.
00:11:30.480,00:11:31.890,奴才只是随口一说,00:11:31.540,00:11:33.135,I said that thoughtlessly.
00:11:32.440,00:11:34.850,或者皇上您要去寿康宫看看太后,00:11:33.500,00:11:36.050,Or would Your Majesty like to visit the Empress Dowager?
00:11:35.440,00:11:36.930,您这些日子忙于朝政,00:11:36.383,00:11:38.272,You have been busy with state affairs these days
00:11:37.440,00:11:39.480,已经很久没去向太后请安了,00:11:38.500,00:11:40.627,and haven’t paid respects to Her Majesty for a long...
00:11:39.740,00:11:40.600,朕明日再去,00:11:40.652,00:11:41.878,I will go tomorrow.
00:11:44.120,00:11:45.200,摆驾延禧宫,,,
00:11:45.740,00:11:46.450,嘛,00:11:44.610,00:11:46.988,Arrange the sedan to go to the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:11:48.040,00:11:48.990,太后病重,00:11:46.988,00:11:47.829,Yes.
00:11:49.500,00:11:51.360,皇上却经常在臣妾这儿,00:11:48.972,00:11:50.475,"The Empress Dowager is seriously ill,"
,,,00:11:50.475,00:11:52.544,yet Your Majesty often stays with me.
00:11:51.960,00:11:53.570,臣妾都快被人骂死了,00:11:52.951,00:11:54.657,I am almost insulted to death by others.
00:11:54.580,00:11:57.250,她们骂你什么 说给朕听听,00:11:55.640,00:11:58.310,How are they insulting you? Tell me.
00:11:57.670,00:11:58.660,狐媚惑主,,,
00:11:59.670,00:12:00.750,红颜祸水,00:11:58.730,00:12:00.522,"""A bewitching minx to her master."""
00:12:02.050,00:12:03.170,在朕听来,00:12:00.730,00:12:02.468,"""Disastrous like a flood to the country."""
00:12:03.800,00:12:05.380,这些都是夸人的话,00:12:03.142,00:12:04.545,"To my ear,"
00:12:06.600,00:12:08.210,皇上也不心疼臣妾,00:12:04.783,00:12:06.553,these are compliments.
00:12:08.720,00:12:10.180,朕怎么不心疼你了,00:12:07.660,00:12:09.440,Your Majesty doesn't care for me.
00:12:10.930,00:12:12.550,皇上要是心疼臣妾,00:12:09.734,00:12:11.430,How do I not?
00:12:12.890,00:12:14.350,就告诉臣妾一句实话,00:12:11.938,00:12:13.692,"If Your Majesty cares about me,"
,,,00:12:13.882,00:12:15.493,just tell me the truth.
00:12:15.400,00:12:16.060,什么,00:12:16.357,00:12:17.403,About what?
00:12:17.440,00:12:18.900,太后病了这些日子,00:12:18.428,00:12:20.170,"For these days that Her Majesty has been sick,"
00:12:19.650,00:12:21.360,皇上为什么不去看太后,00:12:20.710,00:12:22.581,why hasn't Your Majesty visited Her Majesty?
00:12:22.490,00:12:23.900,真的是因为臣妾吗,00:12:23.550,00:12:25.156,Is it really because of me?
00:12:24.780,00:12:26.570,那臣妾可就罪该万死了,00:12:25.733,00:12:27.874,"If so, I ought to die a thousand deaths."
00:12:26.910,00:12:28.740,太后的病因何而起,00:12:27.874,00:12:30.000,She knows better than anyone else
00:12:29.620,00:12:30.980,她自己最清楚,,,
00:12:31.660,00:12:32.900,皇上别动怒,00:12:30.680,00:12:32.252,what caused her illnesses.
00:12:33.670,00:12:35.160,您看您最近这些日子,00:12:32.700,00:12:34.265,"Don't get angry, Your Majesty."
00:12:35.420,00:12:36.780,关在养心殿批折子,00:12:34.527,00:12:38.172,"You have shut yourself in the Hall of
Mental
Cultivation reviewing memorandums."
00:12:37.290,00:12:38.280,脸都绿了,,,
00:12:38.880,00:12:40.240,可要注意身子啊,00:12:38.301,00:12:39.479,You look so pale.
00:12:40.630,00:12:41.960,朕心里有数,00:12:39.940,00:12:41.450,Please take care of your health.
,,,00:12:41.690,00:12:43.170,I'm aware of my health.
00:12:45.010,00:12:48.720,今儿早上胧月来给朕请安,00:12:46.078,00:12:47.362,"This morning,"
,,,00:12:48.010,00:12:50.105,"when Longyue came to pay her respects to me,"
00:12:50.060,00:12:53.720,朕恍惚听见今儿是什么日子,00:12:51.120,00:12:54.780,I thought I heard that today was a day of significance?
00:12:54.690,00:12:55.930,今儿是四月十七,00:12:55.622,00:12:57.142,Today is April 17th.
00:13:00.900,00:13:02.310,也不是什么大日子,00:13:01.880,00:13:03.376,It's not a big day.
00:13:02.690,00:13:04.230,的确不是什么大日子,00:13:03.583,00:13:05.440,It's truly not a big day.
00:13:06.240,00:13:09.230,朕仿佛记得是谁的生日,00:13:07.236,00:13:10.437,I vaguely remember today is someone's birthday.
00:13:11.080,00:13:14.190,皇上臣妾伺候您歇息吧,00:13:12.140,00:13:13.155,"Your Majesty,"
,,,00:13:13.407,00:13:15.530,let me get you ready to rest.
00:13:27.720,00:13:29.130,来 月儿,00:13:28.731,00:13:30.553,"Here, Yue’er."
00:13:30.390,00:13:31.130,吃吧,00:13:31.450,00:13:32.416,Take a bite.
00:13:32.220,00:13:33.010,真乖,00:13:33.280,00:13:34.399,Good girl.
00:13:35.730,00:13:38.090,妹妹 你这是怎么了,00:13:36.621,00:13:39.216,"Meizhuang, what's going on?"
00:13:38.730,00:13:40.100,非让我把胧月带过来,00:13:39.813,00:13:41.459,You asked me to bring Longyue here
00:13:40.610,00:13:41.690,也不说什么缘故,00:13:41.670,00:13:42.900,and didn't say why.
00:13:43.070,00:13:44.060,敬妃姐姐,00:13:44.130,00:13:45.502,"Estime,"
00:13:44.780,00:13:46.770,今天是嬛儿的生日,00:13:45.744,00:13:47.896,today is Huan’er’s birthday.
00:13:51.370,00:13:53.480,惠嫔这话可说不得,00:13:52.310,00:13:54.799,"Concubine Vertu, you can't talk about this."
00:13:54.700,00:13:56.320,我知道皇上下了旨,00:13:55.720,00:13:57.627,I know His Majesty has decreed
00:13:56.830,00:13:58.200,不许让人提嬛儿,00:13:57.834,00:13:59.612,to forbid any mentions of Huan’er
00:13:58.830,00:14:00.570,更不许提胧月的生母,00:13:59.890,00:14:02.071,and of Longyue’s birth mother.
00:14:01.960,00:14:03.000,可是嬛儿,00:14:03.020,00:14:04.060,But Huan’er…
00:14:03.300,00:14:05.080,她终究是胧月的亲生额娘,00:14:04.085,00:14:06.140,She is Longyue’s mother after all.
00:14:05.470,00:14:06.670,我不能不让姐姐,,,
00:14:07.010,00:14:08.340,带着胧月过来坐一坐,,,
00:14:08.760,00:14:10.130,以表一点心意,00:14:06.486,00:14:11.287,"I had to ask you to bring Longyue here
to show my thoughts for her."
00:14:11.720,00:14:13.760,我知道你心里惦记着莞嫔,00:14:12.732,00:14:15.199,I know you have Concubine Sourire in your heart.
00:14:14.560,00:14:15.760,我何尝不是啊,00:14:15.620,00:14:16.960,I do too.
00:14:17.730,00:14:18.930,我早看出来了,00:14:18.797,00:14:20.253,I've been aware that
00:14:19.400,00:14:21.640,皇上表面是放下莞嫔了,00:14:20.460,00:14:23.174,His Majesty pretends to have let go of her.
00:14:22.110,00:14:23.970,其实这心里还惦记着呢,00:14:23.199,00:14:25.278,But he still has her on his mind.
00:14:24.780,00:14:27.520,你看自从莞嫔出宫以后,00:14:25.840,00:14:28.719,"You see, since Concubine Sourire left the palace,"
00:14:27.860,00:14:30.190,皇上除了去安嫔和祺嫔那里,00:14:28.856,00:14:31.690,"other than visiting Concubine An and Concubine Délice,"
00:14:31.410,00:14:34.870,就连咱们后宫都不踏进半步了,00:14:32.429,00:14:36.049,His Majesty barely sets half his foot into the harem.
00:14:35.330,00:14:37.320,皇上来不来后宫都无妨,00:14:36.390,00:14:38.740,It doesn't matter if His Majesty visits the harem.
00:14:38.040,00:14:39.500,我只惦记着嬛儿,00:14:39.044,00:14:40.922,My thoughts are only with Huan'er.
00:14:40.250,00:14:42.330,不知道她在宫外过得好不好,00:14:41.199,00:14:43.742,I wonder how she is doing outside the palace.
00:14:43.380,00:14:44.960,自从去年冬天,,,
00:14:45.170,00:14:47.000,太后断断续续地病了之后,00:14:44.440,00:14:48.158,"Since the Empress Dowager fell ill last winter,"
00:14:47.340,00:14:50.130,连芳若姑姑也不得空出宫去了,00:14:48.400,00:14:51.319,even Madam Orchid can't spare time to leave the palace.
00:14:50.390,00:14:51.840,没事的一定没事的,00:14:51.344,00:14:53.106,I'm sure she's all right!
00:14:52.510,00:14:53.840,莞嫔吉人天相,00:14:53.561,00:14:55.231,Concubine Sourire is blessed.
00:14:54.720,00:14:56.050,不会再有人欺负她的,00:14:55.780,00:14:57.417,No one will bully her any more.
00:14:56.970,00:14:57.680,放心,00:14:58.030,00:14:59.040,Don't worry.
00:15:03.190,00:15:03.890,皇上,,,
00:15:04.270,00:15:05.140,皇上 您怎么了,00:15:04.250,00:15:05.024,Your Majesty!
00:15:05.480,00:15:06.100,皇上,00:15:05.330,00:15:06.496,Your Majesty! Are you all right?
00:15:06.900,00:15:07.640,皇上,00:15:06.540,00:15:07.160,Your Majesty!
,,,00:15:07.960,00:15:08.700,Your Majesty!
00:15:08.990,00:15:11.020,苏公公 苏公公,00:15:10.050,00:15:12.080,Mr. Su! Mr. Su!
00:15:13.370,00:15:14.980,小兔崽子 出事了,,,
00:15:15.200,00:15:15.940,皇上 皇上你怎么了,00:15:14.279,00:15:16.040,You sleepy rabbit! Something's wrong!
00:15:16.290,00:15:17.740,皇上 皇上,00:15:16.260,00:15:17.240,Is Your Majesty all right?
00:15:17.910,00:15:18.740,怎么了 怎么了,00:15:17.350,00:15:18.800,"Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!"
00:15:19.210,00:15:19.740,皇上 怎么了,00:15:18.970,00:15:19.800,What happened?
00:15:19.960,00:15:20.790,苏公公 快快快,,,
00:15:21.420,00:15:22.450,皇上突然发高热,00:15:20.607,00:15:21.685,Mr. Su! Quickly!
00:15:22.750,00:15:23.540,快去传太医呀,00:15:22.292,00:15:23.810,It's a high fever!
00:15:24.170,00:15:24.700,皇上,00:15:23.810,00:15:25.014,Summon the imperial doctors immediately!
00:15:24.920,00:15:25.660,快去吧 您,00:15:25.440,00:15:25.970,Your Majesty!
00:15:25.920,00:15:27.000,是是是 太医,00:15:25.980,00:15:26.800,"Hurry, Mr. Su!"
,,,00:15:26.853,00:15:28.213,"Yes, the imperial doctors..."
00:15:27.670,00:15:29.750,传太医 快,00:15:28.730,00:15:30.810,Summon the imperial doctors immediately! Hurry!
00:15:30.300,00:15:31.000,宝鹃,00:15:31.360,00:15:32.060,Coua...
00:15:32.720,00:15:34.130,快去把里头的香料倒了,00:15:33.691,00:15:35.635,Dispose of the incense in this right away!
00:15:34.600,00:15:36.380,这里头的东西可千万不能见人,00:15:35.660,00:15:37.440,No one can see the contents.
00:15:36.720,00:15:38.840,记住闭紧你的嘴,00:15:37.780,00:15:38.395,"Remember,"
00:15:39.770,00:15:41.350,若香炉里的东西传出去,00:15:38.395,00:15:39.900,keep your lips sealed!
00:15:42.310,00:15:44.350,我和你都死无葬身之地,00:15:40.718,00:15:43.227,"If anyone finds out what's in the censer,"
00:15:45.310,00:15:45.890,快去呀,00:15:43.227,00:15:45.783,Neither you nor I will have a burial ground for our dead bodies.
00:15:46.070,00:15:46.680,好,00:15:46.370,00:15:46.950,Go!
,,,00:15:47.130,00:15:47.740,Yes.
00:15:54.240,00:15:56.230,皇帝已经移去养心殿了吗,00:15:55.108,00:15:57.550,Has the Emperor been transferred to the Hall of Mental Cultivation?
00:15:56.490,00:15:57.150,是的,00:15:57.550,00:15:58.473,Yes.
00:15:57.950,00:16:00.160,已经安排了嫔妃和众亲王,,,
00:16:00.460,00:16:01.540,轮流侍疾了,00:15:59.010,00:16:02.857,"We've already arranged concubines and State
Princes to take turns attending to His Majesty."
00:16:02.370,00:16:04.080,侍疾的嫔妃无需多,00:16:03.430,00:16:05.521,"There's no need for too many concubines,"
00:16:04.790,00:16:06.750,尤其不要妖媚的,00:16:05.850,00:16:08.148,especially not the bewitching ones.
00:16:07.880,00:16:10.370,就皇后齐妃敬妃,00:16:08.915,00:16:12.184,"The Empress, Consort Astuce, Consort Estime,"
00:16:11.590,00:16:13.170,还有惠嫔就可以了,00:16:12.438,00:16:14.374,and Concubine Vertu should suffice.
00:16:13.380,00:16:14.040,嘛,00:16:14.440,00:16:15.100,Yes.
00:16:14.800,00:16:16.960,太医看了皇帝的病怎么说,00:16:15.748,00:16:18.129,What did the imperial doctors have to say?
00:16:17.350,00:16:18.050,太医说,,,
00:16:18.430,00:16:21.170,皇上脉象虚浮 操劳过度,00:16:18.385,00:16:22.644,"That His Majesty's pulse is feeble and
floating,
suggesting that he has strained himself."
00:16:22.310,00:16:24.430,皇帝最近都在哪儿啊,00:16:23.370,00:16:25.718,What has the emperor been doing lately?
00:16:24.940,00:16:27.520,皇上不是见大臣就是批折子,00:16:26.000,00:16:28.702,Either meeting with officials or reviewing memoranda.
00:16:28.190,00:16:29.680,不过也不知为什么,00:16:29.218,00:16:30.777,"But these past few days,"
00:16:29.900,00:16:32.520,这几天总是不高兴的样子,00:16:30.960,00:16:33.806,His Majesty has seemed unhappy for some reason.
00:16:32.990,00:16:35.190,那侍寝呢都有谁,00:16:34.010,00:16:36.395,Who has been serving the emperor at night?
00:16:35.620,00:16:37.280,多半都是安嫔娘娘,,,
00:16:37.580,00:16:38.610,要不就是祺嫔,00:16:36.680,00:16:38.433,"Mostly Her Highness Concubine An,"
00:16:39.160,00:16:40.820,不过侍寝的日子也不多,00:16:38.458,00:16:40.000,and sometimes Concubine Délice.
00:16:41.660,00:16:43.240,太后您若是不相信,00:16:40.119,00:16:42.256,But neither of them for many nights.
00:16:43.620,00:16:45.530,可以去查一下敬事房的记档,00:16:42.720,00:16:44.577,"If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,"
00:16:47.960,00:16:49.620,事情发生在延示喜宫,00:16:44.602,00:16:46.983,you can check the records with Attendance Services.
00:16:50.050,00:16:51.750,总和安嫔脱不了干系,00:16:49.020,00:16:51.110,"The emperor fell ill at the Palace of Prolonging Happiness,"
00:16:53.340,00:16:54.380,可是皇帝,00:16:51.110,00:16:53.224,so Concubine An must be responsible somehow.
00:16:55.010,00:16:57.050,最近都不高兴是怎么回事啊,00:16:54.400,00:16:58.355,But why would the emperor be unhappy recently?
00:16:58.890,00:17:00.130,尤其是这几天,00:16:59.950,00:17:01.716,And especially for these past few days...
00:17:01.720,00:17:03.010,昨儿是什么日子,00:17:02.780,00:17:04.256,What was the date yesterday?
00:17:03.270,00:17:05.880,回太后 昨儿是四月十七,00:17:04.330,00:17:07.155,"Your Majesty, yesterday was April 17."
00:17:07.360,00:17:08.390,有何不妥,00:17:08.420,00:17:09.789,What's wrong with this date?
00:17:10.690,00:17:13.020,昨儿是废妃莞嫔的生辰,00:17:11.562,00:17:14.607,Yesterday was the birthday of the banished Concubine Sourire.
00:17:16.910,00:17:19.490,这么说 就不干安嫔的事,00:17:17.970,00:17:20.849,"If that's the case, then it's not because of Concubine An."
00:17:23.290,00:17:25.400,哀家原以为他放下了,00:17:24.350,00:17:26.689,I thought that he had moved on.
00:17:26.500,00:17:27.450,原来如此,00:17:27.560,00:17:28.744,Now I see...
00:17:30.000,00:17:30.740,苏培盛,,,
00:17:31.000,00:17:31.710,奴才在,00:17:31.060,00:17:31.984,Su Peisheng.
00:17:32.090,00:17:33.670,去告诉安嫔宽心,00:17:32.060,00:17:32.770,Your Majesty.
00:17:34.220,00:17:36.210,陪哀家去看看皇帝,00:17:33.054,00:17:34.913,"Go assure Concubine An not to worry,"
00:17:36.760,00:17:38.340,太后您歇着吧,00:17:35.280,00:17:37.415,and accompany me to check on the emperor.
00:17:38.590,00:17:40.380,您自个儿的身子骨也不好,00:17:37.796,00:17:39.502,"Your Majesty, please stay and rest."
00:17:40.640,00:17:42.000,要是皇上醒来知道了,00:17:39.650,00:17:41.440,You haven't fully recovered yet.
00:17:42.470,00:17:43.550,岂不要怪罪奴才们,00:17:41.590,00:17:43.194,"If His Majesty woke up and found out,"
00:17:43.980,00:17:45.140,没有好好地伺候吗,00:17:43.225,00:17:46.370,"we servants would surely be blamed
for not properly attending to Your Majesty."
00:17:45.310,00:17:46.050,糊涂,00:17:46.370,00:17:47.411,Don't be foolish.
00:17:46.690,00:17:48.720,哀家重要还是皇帝重要,00:17:47.686,00:17:49.892,Am I more important than the emperor?
00:17:49.900,00:17:52.140,竹息扶哀家起来,00:17:50.960,00:17:53.320,"Bamboo, help me get out of bed."
00:17:52.400,00:17:53.060,是,00:17:53.460,00:17:54.308,Yes.
00:17:56.990,00:17:57.650,小姐,,,
00:17:58.200,00:17:58.810,阿晋,00:17:57.978,00:17:58.729,My Lady.
00:17:59.740,00:18:00.650,是阿晋来了,00:17:59.260,00:18:00.000,Ajin!
,,,00:18:00.800,00:18:01.809,Ajin's here.
00:18:01.160,00:18:03.490,宫里来了消息 说皇上身体抱恙,00:18:01.961,00:18:04.859,News came from the palace that His Majesty is ill.
00:18:03.790,00:18:05.780,紧赶着让王爷入宫侍疾去了,00:18:04.884,00:18:07.537,"His Lordship was ordered back to the palace
to attend to His Majesty immediately."
00:18:06.460,00:18:08.370,这一病仿佛还不轻呢,00:18:07.562,00:18:09.759,It seems to be more severe than a normal illness.
00:18:09.790,00:18:10.870,可说是什么病呢,,,
00:18:11.340,00:18:12.700,这个我也不知道,00:18:10.794,00:18:12.375,Did they say what kind of illness it was?
00:18:13.090,00:18:15.420,只恍惚听皇上身边的小厦子说起,00:18:12.400,00:18:13.937,"I don't know for certain,"
,,,00:18:13.962,00:18:17.074,"but apparently His Majesty's servant
 Xiao-Xiazi said that"
00:18:16.260,00:18:19.670,仿佛是宿在安嫔宫里时发高热,00:18:17.099,00:18:21.028,His Majesty developed a high fever while staying with Concubine An.
00:18:20.050,00:18:21.090,究竟是什么缘由,,,
00:18:21.390,00:18:22.340,宫里也是讳莫如深了,00:18:21.053,00:18:23.989,"But the cause of illness ...
Nobody in the palace dares speak of it."
00:18:23.100,00:18:24.180,皇上心思深,,,
00:18:24.680,00:18:26.390,难免操心太过伤了身子,00:18:24.152,00:18:27.959,"His Majesty is often in deep thought.
Overexertion was inevitable."
00:18:27.940,00:18:30.140,王爷此去可还住在凝晖堂吗,00:18:28.906,00:18:31.515,Will His Lordship stay at the Hall of Converging Light again?
00:18:30.480,00:18:32.270,是王爷得了太后嘱咐,,,
00:18:32.520,00:18:34.610,和恒亲王 慎贝勒一同入宫侍疾,00:18:31.540,00:18:36.146,"Yes. The Empress Dowager also summoned
State Prince Heng and Venerable Prince Shen."
00:18:35.530,00:18:37.440,这回皇上是病得不轻啊,00:18:36.426,00:18:39.031,It seems that His Majesty's illness is quite severe.
00:18:39.240,00:18:41.730,那他这些日子都不能出宫了是吗,00:18:39.998,00:18:43.155,"So, he cannot leave the palace for a few days, can he?"
00:18:42.120,00:18:43.820,王爷要在宫里侍疾不能出来,,,
00:18:44.160,00:18:44.900,可阿晋却不要紧,00:18:43.180,00:18:45.960,"His Lordship cannot leave the palace, but I can."
00:18:46.450,00:18:48.620,王爷知道这些日子不能来看娘子,,,
00:18:48.910,00:18:49.620,所以特意嘱咐了,00:18:47.546,00:18:50.138,"His Lordship knew that he wouldn't be able to see you,"
00:18:50.000,00:18:51.030,把这个花笺送给娘子,00:18:50.138,00:18:52.825,so he instructed me to bring you his personal stationery
00:18:52.040,00:18:54.080,请娘子有空的时候互为唱和,00:18:53.035,00:18:55.365,hoping to communicate with you through poetry.
00:18:54.460,00:18:55.620,阿晋每日会来一次,,,
00:18:56.420,00:18:57.790,将娘子写的给王爷,00:18:55.390,00:18:56.945,I will come here every day
00:18:58.130,00:18:58.870,王爷写的给娘子,00:18:57.152,00:19:00.000,"to carry your poem to His Lordship, and his to you."
00:18:59.760,00:19:00.670,一张机,00:19:00.820,00:19:02.031,“The Loom Stretched Once.”
00:19:01.430,00:19:03.510,采桑陌上试春衣,00:19:02.371,00:19:05.166,"""Donning a spring cloak, traversing fields to collect mulberry leaves"""

00:19:12.940,00:19:15.020,明明是因病侍疾不能出宫,00:19:14.024,00:19:16.444,"He can't leave because he must attend to His Majesty,"
00:19:15.440,00:19:18.520,可他偏要说 花上啼莺留人住,00:19:16.500,00:19:19.935,but he instead said that singing birds made him stay.
00:19:19.990,00:19:22.730,这样的闲雅疏狂也便有他了,00:19:21.021,00:19:24.241,Such elegance and mischief - only in him.
00:19:28.870,00:19:29.990,两张机,00:19:29.930,00:19:31.600,“The Loom Stretched Twice.”

00:19:41.630,00:19:44.550,回头一笑花间归去,00:19:42.631,00:19:46.353,"“Turning her head, she smiles, quickly disappearing into the flowers.”"
00:19:45.220,00:19:47.380,只恐被花知,00:19:46.353,00:19:48.974,“Afraid that even the blossoms might know her heart.”
00:19:50.890,00:19:51.850,你给王爷送去,,,

00:19:54.480,00:19:55.340,一则太过显眼,00:19:53.619,00:19:55.474,and tell him there's no need to send one back every day.
,,,00:19:55.499,00:19:56.511,"It might draw attention,"
00:19:55.820,00:19:58.150,二来他在宫中侍疾也辛苦得很,00:19:56.777,00:19:59.046,plus he must be tired from attending His Majesty.
00:19:58.860,00:20:00.350,娘子果然体贴我们王爷,,,

00:20:02.490,00:20:03.730,王爷这些日子出不了宫,00:20:01.591,00:20:03.296,I'll make sure to keep it safe.
00:20:04.490,00:20:06.200,这花笺可是当宝贝来看的,00:20:03.555,00:20:05.433,"His Lordship can't leave the palace these days,"
00:20:06.490,00:20:08.480,只怕王爷是日里看夜里看,00:20:05.473,00:20:07.373,so I'm sure he will treasure this letter.

00:20:23.260,00:20:25.500,皇帝可有苏醒的述象,00:20:24.320,00:20:26.780,Has the emperor shown signs of regaining consciousness?
00:20:25.720,00:20:26.460,还没有,00:20:26.780,00:20:27.926,Not yet.
00:20:27.100,00:20:29.550,太医说皇上是高热虚弱,00:20:28.160,00:20:30.749,"The imperial doctors said that
His Majesty is weak, and"
00:20:29.850,00:20:31.640,苏醒还得要些时辰,00:20:30.815,00:20:32.700,with the high fever it will take some time to regain consciousness.
00:20:41.940,00:20:43.020,这些日子,00:20:42.962,00:20:44.310,"These days,"
00:20:44.110,00:20:45.100,皇帝呀,00:20:45.170,00:20:46.337,the emperor
00:20:46.660,00:20:48.440,他真是太任性了,00:20:47.720,00:20:49.880,has been wallowing in his emotions.
00:20:49.490,00:20:51.110,哀家知道他心里苦,00:20:50.427,00:20:52.671,"I understand the bitterness in his heart,"
00:20:52.080,00:20:54.700,也知道他不是个轻易失度的人,00:20:52.952,00:20:56.520,"and that he doesn't easily lose his composure,"
00:20:57.960,00:21:01.750,可是皇帝太不爱惜自己了,00:20:59.020,00:21:00.440,but the emperor
00:21:04.260,00:21:05.620,太后一定要珍重自身,00:21:00.925,00:21:03.200,has overly neglected his own well-being.
00:21:05.930,00:21:07.460,千万别再伤了自己的身子,00:21:05.175,00:21:06.821,Your Majesty must take care as well
,,,00:21:06.846,00:21:08.971,not to allow any harm to come to your health.
00:21:10.720,00:21:13.060,这儿你们好好看照着,00:21:11.780,00:21:14.233,Attend to the emperor carefully.
00:21:13.810,00:21:15.020,每过两个时辰,,,
00:21:15.850,00:21:17.470,让人回报哀家一次,00:21:14.870,00:21:18.714,Send someone to report to me every four hours.
00:21:18.810,00:21:21.150,让皇帝静静地躺着,,,
00:21:21.650,00:21:22.730,别让人吵扰,00:21:19.870,00:21:23.834,Let the emperor rest in bed peacefully and undisturbed.
00:21:22.900,00:21:23.560,是,00:21:23.880,00:21:24.540,Yes.
00:21:24.110,00:21:26.070,朝政上的事自会有人料理,00:21:24.983,00:21:27.192,State affairs have been taken care of in the meantime.
00:21:26.660,00:21:27.610,太后安心吧,00:21:27.720,00:21:28.971,Your Majesty need not worry.
00:21:32.240,00:21:33.950,那哀家就先回去了,00:21:33.300,00:21:35.257,I will take my leave now.
00:21:35.210,00:21:36.410,你多陪陪皇帝,,,
00:21:37.040,00:21:37.660,是,00:21:36.118,00:21:38.100,"Spend some more time with the emperor, would you?"
,,,00:21:38.100,00:21:38.946,Yes.

00:21:51.720,00:21:52.460,什么,00:21:52.607,00:21:53.632,What was that?
00:21:54.180,00:21:55.510,皇兄想念皇嫂了,00:21:55.276,00:21:57.206,His Majesty was calling the late Empress Première.
00:21:59.400,00:22:00.230,这些年,00:22:00.253,00:22:01.467,"After all these years,"
00:22:01.650,00:22:05.480,皇帝放不下的难道就你皇嫂一个,00:22:02.710,00:22:06.864,is she really the only one the emperor hasn't let go of?
00:22:06.530,00:22:08.190,皇兄情深意重,00:22:07.404,00:22:09.393,His Majesty has deep and lasting affection.
00:22:08.530,00:22:11.570,这情深意重是帝王家不该有的,00:22:09.393,00:22:12.831,That is not something an emperor should possess!
00:22:13.990,00:22:17.580,这一点皇帝就比不过你,00:22:15.050,00:22:18.736,"On this matter, the emperor should learn from you."

00:24:42.520,00:24:44.130,太后都说不关你的事,00:24:42.330,00:24:43.180,It's all right.
00:24:44.560,00:24:45.850,你又何必自己放不下,00:24:43.580,00:24:45.488,The Empress Dowager said you were not involved.
00:24:46.690,00:24:48.270,你要是不懂侍奉皇上,00:24:45.513,00:24:47.480,Don't trouble yourself over it.

00:24:52.820,00:24:55.530,这一两年来皇上少进后宫,00:24:53.696,00:24:56.800,His Majesty has rarely visited the harem in the past couple of years.
00:24:55.740,00:24:56.980,譬如齐妃吧,00:24:56.800,00:24:58.363,Take Consort Astuce for instance.
00:24:57.410,00:24:59.400,就再没有单独见过皇上,00:24:58.388,00:25:00.862,She has never seen His Majesty alone.
00:24:59.830,00:25:02.410,有这样的福气你要惜福才是,00:25:00.887,00:25:03.994,You should cherish your fortune while you have it.

00:25:33.650,00:25:34.810,你这样出身的人,00:25:31.990,00:25:34.162,Naturally she would favor women of similar upbringing.
00:25:35.280,00:25:37.400,能够在皇后身边伺候洒扫,00:25:34.590,00:25:36.211,It's already to your great fortune
00:25:37.740,00:25:38.900,已经是你的福气了,00:25:36.522,00:25:38.278,that a person of your birth
00:25:39.830,00:25:41.910,能有今日你该千恩万谢,00:25:38.544,00:25:40.647,could sweep and clean in her palace.
,,,00:25:41.041,00:25:43.732,You should constantly feel grateful for what you have today.
00:25:42.580,00:25:45.570,难道还要跟我争夺宠幸吗,00:25:43.732,00:25:46.596,"You know you shouldn't compete with me
for favor, don't you?"
00:25:46.420,00:25:47.120,是,00:25:47.480,00:25:48.180,Yes.
00:25:56.180,00:25:57.420,起轿,00:25:57.240,00:25:58.644,Raise the sedan.
00:26:03.890,00:26:05.260,娘娘这样不眠不休的,00:26:04.724,00:26:06.647,Your Majesty hasn't rested at all.
00:26:06.020,00:26:08.100,不如先休息片刻再来陪皇上吧,00:26:07.054,00:26:09.815,"How about getting some rest before
continuing to attend to His Majesty?"
00:26:09.230,00:26:10.010,不必了,,,
00:26:11.190,00:26:12.430,本宫已经很久,00:26:10.251,00:26:11.547,There is no need.
00:26:12.900,00:26:15.390,没有这么多时间陪着皇上了,00:26:12.264,00:26:16.889,"I haven't been able to accompany
His Majesty for such a long time."
00:26:16.610,00:26:20.070,也不能这么仔细地看着皇上,00:26:17.670,00:26:21.259,Nor have I been able to look so closely at His Majesty.
00:26:26.500,00:26:28.780,皇上皇上,00:26:27.372,00:26:29.976,Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
00:26:29.420,00:26:30.330,你醒了,00:26:30.439,00:26:31.716,Your Majesty is awake!
00:26:32.040,00:26:33.080,快拿杯水来给皇上,,,

00:26:53.690,00:26:54.220,弘时,00:26:53.529,00:26:54.402,Mother!
00:26:54.440,00:26:55.180,额娘您,00:26:54.717,00:26:55.579,Hongshi.
00:26:55.480,00:26:56.390,您怎么过来了,00:26:55.579,00:26:57.598,Mother... Why did you come here?
00:26:57.240,00:26:58.480,皇上高热刚退,,,
00:26:58.780,00:27:00.060,现在还在昏睡中,00:26:58.219,00:27:01.155,"His Majesty's fever has come down, but he is still asleep."
00:27:00.490,00:27:02.480,那那额娘怎么没去侍疾呢,00:27:01.581,00:27:03.917,How ... How come you are not attending to His Majesty?
00:27:03.660,00:27:05.070,额娘趁着皇后侍疾,,,
00:27:05.370,00:27:06.320,才能来看看你,00:27:04.679,00:27:07.682,"The Empress is attending to His Majesty now,
so I took the chance to come see you."
00:27:08.500,00:27:12.120,弘时额娘又快两个月,00:27:09.560,00:27:10.566,Hongshi.
00:27:12.380,00:27:13.460,没跟你说上话了,00:27:11.867,00:27:14.580,It's been almost two months since I last talked to you.
00:27:14.090,00:27:14.750,额娘,00:27:15.118,00:27:15.983,Mother.
00:27:15.590,00:27:16.830,儿子也很挂念您,00:27:16.624,00:27:18.306,I also miss you very much.
00:27:20.550,00:27:21.130,弘时,00:27:21.555,00:27:22.435,Hongshi.
00:27:22.720,00:27:24.510,你读书别太累着,00:27:23.658,00:27:25.645,Do not overwork yourself with the books.
00:27:26.390,00:27:27.680,额娘看着,00:27:27.450,00:27:29.010,"Looking at you right now,"
00:27:29.140,00:27:30.630,你都瘦多了,00:27:30.104,00:27:31.905,you have lost a lot of weight.
00:27:31.730,00:27:34.470,皇额娘要儿子日夜勤读书,00:27:32.837,00:27:35.935,Imperial Mother tells me to be studious day and night
00:27:35.320,00:27:36.810,皇阿玛才会喜欢儿子,00:27:36.206,00:27:38.474,so that I will have more favor with Father.
00:27:37.610,00:27:39.350,皇后不是你的亲额娘,00:27:38.474,00:27:40.719,The Empress is not your birth mother.
00:27:39.900,00:27:41.390,她自然不会心疼你,00:27:40.884,00:27:42.714,Of course she doesn't care for your health.
00:27:42.410,00:27:43.400,你是长子,,,
00:27:43.820,00:27:45.610,是唯一养在宫里的儿子,00:27:43.470,00:27:44.855,You are the eldest son.
,,,00:27:44.855,00:27:46.936,And the only prince living in the palace.
00:27:46.330,00:27:48.160,你将来是要继承大统的,00:27:47.390,00:27:49.355,You will be the heir to the throne.
00:27:48.910,00:27:51.450,你皇阿玛怎么会不喜欢你呢,00:27:49.863,00:27:52.510,How can your father not favor you?
00:27:54.460,00:27:55.370,弘时,00:27:55.520,00:27:56.430,Hongshi.
00:27:57.670,00:27:58.500,好孩子,00:27:58.650,00:27:59.555,My dear.
00:28:00.260,00:28:01.290,你要当心,00:28:01.150,00:28:02.687,You have to take care of yourself.
00:28:03.220,00:28:04.800,你别熬坏了身子,00:28:04.176,00:28:05.860,Don't let your health suffer.
00:28:05.550,00:28:08.010,额娘看着就心疼,00:28:06.464,00:28:09.315,I am sad looking at you.
00:28:08.680,00:28:09.390,额娘,00:28:09.699,00:28:10.583,"Mother,"
00:28:10.270,00:28:12.180,我几次三番请求皇额娘,00:28:11.247,00:28:13.403,I have asked Imperial Mother many times
00:28:12.850,00:28:15.640,可皇额娘都说儿子功课忙,00:28:13.822,00:28:16.918,but she says that I'm too busy with schoolwork
00:28:16.060,00:28:16.930,不让儿子见您,00:28:16.943,00:28:18.423,and doesn't allow me to see you.
00:28:18.070,00:28:18.770,额娘,00:28:19.169,00:28:20.224,Mother.
00:28:19.690,00:28:22.110,我还偷偷跑去长春宫门口看过您,00:28:20.737,00:28:23.563,I even went to the Palace of Eternal Spring in secret.
00:28:24.240,00:28:25.700,可连个影子也没看见,00:28:25.273,00:28:27.253,But I couldn't even catch a glimpse of you at the gate.
00:28:26.580,00:28:27.820,额娘也是,00:28:27.640,00:28:28.991,Me as well.
00:28:30.160,00:28:32.620,皇后总不让额娘见你,00:28:31.151,00:28:33.750,"Her Majesty never permits me to see you,"
00:28:33.540,00:28:35.530,说怕耽误了你读书,00:28:34.564,00:28:36.800,saying that I will disturb your studies.
00:28:36.500,00:28:38.330,甚至连一件衣裳,00:28:37.607,00:28:39.680,She doesn't even let me send over
00:28:39.590,00:28:40.950,和一份点心,00:28:40.392,00:28:42.180,a single piece of clothing
00:28:41.670,00:28:44.210,都不让额娘送过来,00:28:42.654,00:28:45.177,or a plate of pastries.
00:28:46.470,00:28:50.210,额娘真是后悔呀,00:28:47.554,00:28:51.334,I truly regret everything.
00:28:50.770,00:28:53.180,额娘您后悔什么,00:28:51.779,00:28:54.309,"Mother, what do you mean?"
00:28:54.650,00:28:56.310,都是额娘不好,00:28:55.789,00:28:57.449,It's all my fault.
00:28:58.150,00:29:00.100,不能好好地管教你,00:28:59.140,00:29:01.191,I'm unable to look after you.
00:29:03.820,00:29:05.310,额娘就盼着你,00:29:04.735,00:29:06.875,I am looking forward to the day
00:29:06.240,00:29:08.030,哪天继承大统,00:29:07.135,00:29:09.328,you ascend to the throne.
00:29:08.830,00:29:11.110,额娘就不会再这么,00:29:09.688,00:29:12.493,"I will no longer be like this,"
00:29:11.620,00:29:15.530,担惊受怕地过日子了,00:29:12.609,00:29:16.682,living in fear and worry.
00:29:17.210,00:29:18.490,儿子要为额娘争气,,,
00:29:19.460,00:29:21.080,将来封额娘为皇太后,00:29:18.056,00:29:20.000,"I will make you proud, Mother."
00:29:21.590,00:29:22.750,好好补偿额娘,00:29:20.505,00:29:22.344,"I will honor you as the Empress Dowager,"
00:29:23.010,00:29:23.920,好孩子,00:29:22.555,00:29:24.851,"- and repay you profusely.
- My good son."
00:29:30.010,00:29:32.760,齐妃真的是这么告诉三阿哥的,00:29:30.991,00:29:34.009,Was that really what Consort Astuce said to the Third Prince?
00:29:33.180,00:29:35.300,奴婢亲耳听到的千真万确,00:29:34.140,00:29:36.671,"Exactly, I heard it with my own ears."
00:29:36.100,00:29:37.680,娘娘您待三阿哥那么好,00:29:37.018,00:29:38.981,"Your Majesty has been so good to the Third Prince,"
00:29:37.980,00:29:39.850,衣食周全悉心教导,00:29:39.040,00:29:41.134,providing him comfortable living conditions and attentive guidance.
00:29:40.400,00:29:42.520,可这毕竟不是自己亲生的孩子,00:29:41.407,00:29:43.655,"But after all, he is not your child."
00:29:42.860,00:29:44.320,奴婢听着都觉得寒心,00:29:43.880,00:29:45.660,It makes my heart cold with disappointment.
00:29:45.030,00:29:46.640,三阿哥那么大了,00:29:46.011,00:29:47.772,The Third Prince is older now.
00:29:46.860,00:29:49.650,和年幼的孩子要不一样一些,00:29:47.797,00:29:50.574,He's different from the younger children.
00:29:51.160,00:29:53.530,可惜四阿哥卑微,,,
00:29:53.830,00:29:54.820,五阿哥多病,00:29:52.220,00:29:56.137,"Sadly, the Fourth Prince is inferior,
and the Fifth Prince is sickly."
00:29:55.250,00:29:57.030,都不是可以调教的孩子,00:29:56.199,00:29:58.033,Neither is fit for fostering.
00:29:59.790,00:30:01.580,三阿哥不懂事就算了,00:30:00.850,00:30:03.102,"The Third Prince might be immature,"
00:30:02.170,00:30:04.000,齐妃更是个糊涂的,00:30:03.126,00:30:05.268,but Consort Astuce is even more foolish.
00:30:05.220,00:30:07.170,不过三阿哥还是听娘娘话的,00:30:06.282,00:30:08.573,"Fortunately, the Third Prince still obeys Your Majesty."
00:30:07.550,00:30:08.760,最近也用功多了,00:30:08.626,00:30:10.396,He has been putting in more effort recently.
00:30:09.760,00:30:11.380,不过就齐妃这么挑峻,00:30:10.782,00:30:12.495,"But with Consort Astute stirring the pot,"
00:30:11.760,00:30:13.250,娘娘您真是白护着她了,00:30:12.673,00:30:14.762,Your Majesty's good intentions for her are wasted.
00:30:14.020,00:30:16.300,知恩图报乃人间正理,00:30:15.080,00:30:17.414,"""One shall repay another's gratitude in kind."""
00:30:16.690,00:30:19.850,齐妃不懂也不懂得回报本宫,00:30:17.686,00:30:20.893,"Consort Astuce seems oblivious of this, and unappreciative."
00:30:20.360,00:30:21.600,有这样的额娘,00:30:21.360,00:30:22.911,"With a mother like her,"
00:30:22.020,00:30:24.140,本宫再怎么悉心调教,00:30:23.044,00:30:25.280,it won't matter what kind of effort I put forth.
00:30:24.480,00:30:27.440,三阿哥的前途都会堪忧,00:30:25.389,00:30:28.780,The Third Prince's future will always be uncertain.
00:30:27.990,00:30:30.150,就齐妃也妄想当皇太后,00:30:28.981,00:30:31.331,Consort Astuce covets the title of Empress Dowager.
00:30:30.740,00:30:31.610,她也配吗,,,
00:30:31.870,00:30:32.780,她怎么不配,00:30:32.000,00:30:32.880,How is she worthy?
00:30:33.290,00:30:34.870,她是三阿哥的生母,00:30:33.015,00:30:34.082,How is she not??
00:30:35.160,00:30:36.650,来日三阿哥登基之后,00:30:34.236,00:30:36.066,She is the birth mother of the Third Prince.
00:30:37.080,00:30:38.740,她这位圣母皇太后,00:30:36.108,00:30:37.874,"When the Third Prince takes the throne,"
00:30:39.290,00:30:40.830,自然要盖过本宫,00:30:38.062,00:30:40.350,"she will be the Divine Mother Empress Dowager,"
00:30:41.210,00:30:42.920,这位母后皇太后了,00:30:40.350,00:30:43.775,"surpassing me, the Imperial Mother Empress Dowager."
00:30:43.300,00:30:43.950,您看齐妃,,,
00:30:44.210,00:30:45.920,现在就急着教三阿哥这些,00:30:44.222,00:30:47.125,"You can see Consort Astuce is anxious
to teach this to the Third Prince now."
00:30:47.300,00:30:49.460,这些是她的心里话,00:30:48.360,00:30:50.666,Her words come from her heart.
00:30:49.930,00:30:50.960,怎么不能教,00:30:50.865,00:30:52.243,Why can't she teach them to him?
00:30:52.100,00:30:54.800,本宫原以为上回护着她了,00:30:53.186,00:30:55.886,"I thought that since I protect her,"
00:30:55.020,00:30:57.720,她将来安分做个太妃也就罢了,00:30:56.080,00:30:58.855,she would be satisfied being a Consort Dowager in the future.
00:30:58.690,00:31:00.550,原来她如此心高啊,00:30:59.711,00:31:01.695,"As it turns out, she is quite ambitious."
00:31:01.020,00:31:02.890,本宫真是小看她了,00:31:02.080,00:31:03.950,I have really underestimated her.
00:31:03.480,00:31:06.650,娘娘 一山可不容二虎啊,00:31:04.463,00:31:05.415,"Your Majesty,"
00:31:06.820,00:31:07.730,她不是虎,00:31:05.944,00:31:07.692,"""Two tigers cannot dwell in one mountain."""
00:31:08.700,00:31:09.530,是猫,00:31:07.717,00:31:08.790,She is no tiger.
,,,00:31:09.760,00:31:10.703,She's a cat.
00:31:10.820,00:31:12.150,一只病猫,00:31:11.880,00:31:13.210,A sick cat.
00:31:20.790,00:31:21.410,王爷,00:31:21.808,00:31:22.694,Your Lordship.
00:31:25.250,00:31:25.910,澜依,00:31:26.186,00:31:27.145,Lanyi.
00:31:28.090,00:31:29.000,你怎么进宫了,,,
00:31:29.300,00:31:30.910,不是要进宫是要出宫了,00:31:29.010,00:31:30.330,What made you come to the palace?
00:31:31.180,00:31:31.920,怎么了,00:31:30.330,00:31:32.033,"I’m not going into the palace, but leaving."
00:31:32.220,00:31:33.080,皇上病体初愈,00:31:32.213,00:31:33.099,What’s the matter?
00:31:33.430,00:31:34.010,太后说呀,00:31:33.099,00:31:34.465,His Majesty has just recovered.
00:31:34.260,00:31:36.130,今年立夏就不表演驯马节目了,00:31:34.490,00:31:37.525,The Empress Dowager called off the horse training performance for Lixia Festival
00:31:36.470,00:31:37.380,让我们先回圆明园,00:31:37.525,00:31:39.194,and asked us to return to the Summer Palace.
00:31:38.430,00:31:40.390,这皇上的病啊才刚好,00:31:39.490,00:31:41.594,His Majesty has just made a recovery.
00:31:40.890,00:31:42.600,看到你呀必定要惊艳,00:31:41.950,00:31:43.660,He would get over-excited if he sees you perform.
00:31:43.520,00:31:46.310,太后这懿旨果然是为了皇上好,00:31:44.580,00:31:47.539,So Her Majesty's decree is truly for His Majesty's own good.
00:31:46.650,00:31:49.610,王爷 什么时候变得这样嘴坏,00:31:47.710,00:31:50.710,"Your Lordship, why would you tease me about it?"
00:31:50.280,00:31:51.110,不是嘴坏,00:31:51.340,00:31:52.256,I'm not teasing.
00:31:51.700,00:31:53.310,是你穿这青色的衣裳啊,,,
00:31:53.820,00:31:54.530,真好看,00:31:52.760,00:31:55.463,It's just that you look so lovely wearing blue garments.
00:31:56.540,00:31:59.070,王爷最近忙 都没空来圆明园了,00:31:57.600,00:32:00.212,Your Lordship has been so busy that you haven't visited the Summer Palace lately.
00:31:59.330,00:32:01.320,等我闲下来 闲下来一定去看你,00:32:00.246,00:32:02.543,I'll definitely go see you when I'm free.
00:32:01.670,00:32:02.530,那王爷别忘记了,,,
00:32:02.670,00:32:03.330,一定,00:32:02.584,00:32:03.705,"Don't forget, Your Lordship."
00:32:04.290,00:32:05.000,走,00:32:03.730,00:32:04.545,Certainly.
,,,00:32:05.251,00:32:06.060,Let’s go.
00:32:15.890,00:32:17.220,批了半天的折子,00:32:16.765,00:32:18.579,I've read memoranda for half a day.
00:32:19.020,00:32:20.000,真是累呀,,,
00:32:20.390,00:32:21.930,皇上您圣体才好,00:32:20.101,00:32:21.277,It's so tiring.
00:32:22.270,00:32:23.050,就忙于朝政,00:32:21.302,00:32:24.431,Your Majesty has been occupied with state affairs when you have just recovered.
00:32:23.690,00:32:25.180,可得小心龙体呀,00:32:24.750,00:32:26.473,Your health takes priority.
00:32:25.810,00:32:27.270,得去哪儿散散心哪,00:32:26.825,00:32:28.423,I should go somewhere to unwind.
00:32:28.400,00:32:30.690,要不皇上去惠嫔娘娘那儿看看,00:32:29.460,00:32:31.750,How about visiting Her Highness Concubine Vertu?
00:32:31.740,00:32:32.980,您病的那段日子,00:32:32.800,00:32:34.213,"When you were sick,"
00:32:33.490,00:32:35.600,惠嫔娘娘侍奉得最勤了,00:32:34.550,00:32:36.660,Concubine Vertu served the most diligently.
00:32:36.160,00:32:38.150,惠嫔倒也细心殷勤,00:32:37.179,00:32:39.380,"Concubine Vertu is careful and attentive,"
00:32:39.950,00:32:42.570,但朕看着她怎么觉得有点累呀,00:32:40.938,00:32:43.813,but why does it tire me when I see her?
00:32:44.420,00:32:46.580,那是因为皇上以前遇上的,,,
00:32:46.920,00:32:48.370,都是国色天香的才女,00:32:45.607,00:32:49.430,"That's because the ladies Your Majesty previously encountered
are all beautiful and talented."
00:32:48.960,00:32:50.620,自然笑语怡人哪,00:32:49.897,00:32:51.718,Their words and smiles are pleasing.
00:32:51.340,00:32:52.330,眼睛真毒,00:32:52.425,00:32:53.813,Your eyes are viciously sharp.
00:32:54.180,00:32:55.540,看到点子上了,00:32:55.328,00:32:56.807,You saw the core of the matter.
00:32:57.100,00:32:58.630,你就说这个安嫔吧,00:32:58.160,00:32:59.842,"Take Concubine An,"
00:33:00.060,00:33:01.470,大字也不识几个,00:33:01.154,00:33:02.618,she can barely read.
00:33:01.980,00:33:04.890,唱个歌能让你觉得舒坦,00:33:03.040,00:33:05.950,But her singing brings peace to the mind.
00:33:06.060,00:33:09.770,祺嫔虽然也温柔殷勤,00:33:07.278,00:33:11.111,"Concubine Délice is also gentle and attentive,"
00:33:10.570,00:33:12.430,可你总觉得少了点什么,00:33:11.312,00:33:13.636,but I always feel like there's something lacking.
00:33:13.820,00:33:16.780,要说二者平衡当属莞嫔,00:33:14.796,00:33:17.986,The balance between the two is definitely Concubine Sourire.
00:33:18.910,00:33:19.650,不提也罢,00:33:19.970,00:33:21.375,Let's not speak of her.
00:33:21.870,00:33:24.660,要不皇上去安嫔那儿,00:33:22.837,00:33:25.702,How about visiting Concubine An?
00:33:25.120,00:33:26.360,或者是祺嫔那儿,,,
00:33:26.540,00:33:27.330,算了,00:33:26.180,00:33:27.474,Or Concubine Délice?
,,,00:33:27.499,00:33:28.503,Forget it.
00:33:28.130,00:33:30.080,朕去圆明园逛逛吧,00:33:29.110,00:33:31.300,I will go to the Summer Palace for a walk.
00:33:30.920,00:33:31.660,嘛,00:33:31.927,00:33:32.741,Yes.
00:33:36.220,00:33:37.250,七张机,00:33:37.192,00:33:38.711,“The Loom Stretched Seven Times.”
00:33:38.510,00:33:40.800,鸳鸯织就又迟疑,00:33:39.586,00:33:42.192,“The weaver hesitates over the mandarin ducks she completed.”
00:33:42.020,00:33:44.180,只恐被人轻裁剪,00:33:43.080,00:33:45.996,“Fearing someone’s fleet scissors may cut them apart.”
00:33:46.350,00:33:47.840,分飞两处,,,
00:33:49.190,00:33:50.400,一场离恨,00:33:47.410,00:33:51.813,“Two places they fly to; one bitter separation.”
00:33:51.230,00:33:53.600,何计再相随,00:33:52.290,00:33:54.754,“By what means could they ever meet again?”
00:33:59.910,00:34:01.360,怎么写这样伤感的词啊,00:34:01.022,00:34:02.930,Why do you write such a sad verse?
00:34:05.250,00:34:07.110,已经三十七日不曾看到你了,00:34:06.310,00:34:08.400,I haven't seen you for thirty-seven days.
00:34:08.290,00:34:09.370,我心中害怕,,,
00:34:10.250,00:34:10.990,再害怕,00:34:09.288,00:34:10.705,I was afraid in my heart.
00:34:11.670,00:34:13.130,也不要有这样的伤感之语,00:34:11.310,00:34:14.190,"No matter how afraid you are,
don't speak of such sad things."
00:34:16.720,00:34:18.580,我几乎是看着星沈月落,,,
00:34:18.930,00:34:20.260,整夜整夜思念着你,00:34:17.614,00:34:21.600,"I've been watching the stars sink and moon fall,
thinking about you all night, every night."
00:34:21.100,00:34:21.840,可惜,00:34:22.107,00:34:23.132,"Unfortunately,"
00:34:22.760,00:34:24.500,你不能一直这样来看我,00:34:23.740,00:34:25.996,you can't keep coming to me like this.
00:34:30.940,00:34:31.680,苏培盛,00:34:31.929,00:34:33.003,"Su Peisheng,"
00:34:33.690,00:34:35.400,你说这宫里的女人,00:34:34.484,00:34:36.904,"Why, in your view, do the women in the palace"
00:34:36.740,00:34:39.570,怎么看多了就觉得乏味了呢,00:34:37.844,00:34:40.896,look boring after seeing them too much?
00:34:40.530,00:34:42.570,朕现在觉得看谁都一样,00:34:41.412,00:34:43.705,They all look the same to me now.
00:34:42.910,00:34:44.270,没点新鲜别致的,00:34:43.909,00:34:45.390,Nothing new or special.
00:34:44.790,00:34:47.070,皇上奴才哪懂这些呀,00:34:45.956,00:34:48.680,"Your Majesty, it's beyond my knowledge."
00:34:47.790,00:34:50.370,要不皇上咱们再选一回秀得了,00:34:48.850,00:34:51.430,Why not run another Concubine Selection?
00:34:50.670,00:34:51.780,光选秀有什么用,00:34:51.455,00:34:53.156,How would that help?
00:34:53.170,00:34:56.130,一个个见了朕就万岁万万岁的,00:34:54.217,00:34:58.400,"All of them would chant ""Long live the Emperor,""
and then fall as silent as trembling cicadas."
00:34:56.380,00:34:57.340,噤若寒蝉,,,
00:34:57.720,00:35:00.210,除了脸长得不一样 其他都一样,00:34:58.697,00:35:01.562,"Besides having different faces, everything else is the same."
00:35:00.800,00:35:03.170,可奴才瞧着都觉得不一样啊,00:35:01.813,00:35:04.393,"It's all different in my eyes, Your Majesty."
00:35:03.850,00:35:05.300,一个赛一个地漂亮,00:35:04.845,00:35:06.457,Each is prettier than the last.
00:35:05.770,00:35:07.300,看得奴才眼都花了,00:35:06.642,00:35:08.605,My eyes are dazzled by their beauty.
00:35:08.310,00:35:10.520,你是越发会胡说八道了,00:35:09.370,00:35:12.557,You are getting more pleasant to talk to.
00:35:12.400,00:35:13.480,这是什么地方,00:35:13.318,00:35:14.680,Where is this?
00:35:13.940,00:35:15.730,皇上这是百骏园哪,00:35:14.915,00:35:16.970,"Your Majesty, this is the Hundred Stallion Pavillion."
00:35:16.480,00:35:19.820,专驯化外域进贡的良马用的,00:35:17.540,00:35:20.880,It is used for taming foreign tribute horses.
00:35:20.490,00:35:21.150,去目秋目秋,00:35:21.558,00:35:22.686,Let's go take a look.
00:35:25.410,00:35:27.120,皇上驾到,00:35:26.398,00:35:28.196,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:35:27.450,00:35:28.110,皇上吉祥,00:35:28.221,00:35:29.486,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:35:48.850,00:35:49.640,皇,00:35:49.910,00:35:51.188,Your Majesty...
00:36:28.600,00:36:29.340,段公公,00:36:29.453,00:36:30.262,Mr. Duan.
00:36:31.480,00:36:32.260,苏公公,00:36:32.493,00:36:33.421,Mr. Su.
00:36:34.310,00:36:36.100,那位马上的女子是谁呀,00:36:35.370,00:36:37.298,Who is that lady riding the horse?
00:36:36.310,00:36:36.970,她呀,00:36:37.323,00:36:38.135,Her?
00:36:37.650,00:36:40.440,她就是百骏园的驯马女叶澜依,00:36:38.710,00:36:41.743,"She is Ye Lanyi, the horse trainer in the Hundred-Stallion Pavillion."
00:36:42.530,00:36:43.810,驯马女呀,00:36:43.590,00:36:45.065,A horse trainer.
00:36:46.280,00:36:47.360,她可有福了,00:36:47.347,00:36:48.688,She's in good fortune.
00:36:54.620,00:36:55.580,你是看见了什么,,,
00:36:56.040,00:36:57.000,还是听见了什么,00:36:55.527,00:36:56.976,"Have you seen something,"
,,,00:36:57.001,00:36:58.204,or heard something?
00:36:58.380,00:37:00.120,我看你这次从宫里出来,00:36:59.440,00:37:01.301,You have been unhappy
00:37:00.550,00:37:01.580,一直闷闷不乐的,00:37:01.326,00:37:03.155,since you came back from the palace.
00:37:03.090,00:37:05.710,环儿我在宫里侍疾的时候,00:37:04.150,00:37:06.908,"Huan'er, when I was attending to His Majesty,"
00:37:06.890,00:37:09.050,皇兄在梦里叫了你的名字,00:37:07.950,00:37:10.339,he called your name in his dream.
00:37:10.720,00:37:12.510,我在宫中侍疾三十七日,00:37:11.708,00:37:13.712,I attended to His Majesty for thirty-seven days.
00:37:13.180,00:37:14.800,虽然只听皇兄在睡梦中,,,
00:37:15.100,00:37:16.590,含糊地喊过一次你的名字,00:37:14.240,00:37:17.650,"Although I only heard His Majesty
vaguely call your name once in his sleep,"
00:37:18.190,00:37:19.020,但我也害怕,00:37:19.250,00:37:20.306,I'm still afraid.
00:37:20.110,00:37:20.850,嬛儿,00:37:21.170,00:37:22.160,"Huan'er,"
00:37:21.610,00:37:24.440,我怕有一天会没有你,00:37:22.670,00:37:25.761,I'm afraid of losing you one day.
00:37:28.030,00:37:29.400,那么在皇上的睡梦里,,,
00:37:29.740,00:37:30.730,常常呼p奂着的人,00:37:29.097,00:37:31.797,"The name His Majesty often calls out in the dream,"
00:37:31.160,00:37:33.950,可是纯元皇后宛宛是吗,00:37:32.058,00:37:35.010,"is Empress Première, Surissé, isn't it?"
00:37:34.120,00:37:34.830,是的,,,
00:37:35.420,00:37:36.580,皇兄在养病的时候,00:37:35.093,00:37:36.130,Yes.
00:37:37.080,00:37:37.950,常常独自一人翻看,00:37:36.432,00:37:37.592,"While he was recuperating,"
00:37:38.330,00:37:39.320,纯元皇后的遗物,00:37:37.822,00:37:40.638,"His Majesty often looked through
the relics of Empress Première alone."
00:37:42.880,00:37:44.210,他在清醒的时候,,,
00:37:44.420,00:37:45.760,想念的是纯元皇后,00:37:43.940,00:37:47.159,"When he is awake, the one he misses is Empress Première."
00:37:46.630,00:37:48.250,会在梦中喊我的名字,00:37:47.690,00:37:49.806,The reason why my name was called in his sleep
00:37:49.140,00:37:51.300,大抵是因为我有五分似纯元皇后,00:37:49.997,00:37:52.510,is that I look quite similar to Empress Première.
00:37:53.140,00:37:55.470,他不过是在想念纯元皇后本人时,00:37:54.279,00:37:56.797,He was missing Empress Première
00:37:56.350,00:37:56.970,偶尔想到了,,,
00:37:57.310,00:37:58.640,我这个不受驯的影子罢了,00:37:57.535,00:38:00.429,"and happened to think of me:
an unruly shadow of Empress Première."
00:38:01.110,00:38:03.810,何况我是被驱逐出宫的人,00:38:02.170,00:38:02.772,"Besides,"
