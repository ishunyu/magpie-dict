,,,00:02:30.360,00:02:31.900,I thank Your Majesty.
00:02:40.800,00:02:42.750,许久没见你们一起来了,00:02:41.760,00:02:44.160,I haven't seen you two arrive together in a long time.
00:02:43.360,00:02:44.190,如果宫中,,,
00:02:44.440,00:02:47.190,人人都如你们这样和睦就好了,00:02:44.400,00:02:48.280,"If only everyone in the palace could be
as harmonious as you two."
00:02:47.600,00:02:49.670,我跟姐姐一向和睦啊,00:02:48.560,00:02:50.980,Sourire and I have always been harmonious sisters.
00:02:50.280,00:02:51.340,天气热起来,,,
00:02:51.560,00:02:53.550,皇上说要去圆明园避暑,00:02:51.200,00:02:52.620,"Because the weather is getting hotter,"
00:02:53.960,00:02:55.390,过些日子就要启程,00:02:52.620,00:02:54.840,"His Majesty is planning to escape
the heat in the Summer Palace."
00:02:55.760,00:02:58.030,你们要带哪些人 带什么东西,00:02:54.980,00:02:56.620,We will depart in a few days.
00:02:58.320,00:02:59.590,都早些准备吧,00:02:56.720,00:03:00.660,"You should organize who and what
you want to bring with you beforehand."
00:02:59.960,00:03:00.750,是,00:03:00.940,00:03:02.180,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:03:05.600,00:03:06.910,启禀皇后娘娘,,,
00:03:07.280,00:03:08.630,太后自从病了以后,00:03:06.500,00:03:07.940,"Your Majesty,"
00:03:08.880,00:03:10.230,不曾离开宫禁避暑,00:03:08.240,00:03:11.420,"The Empress Dowager has not been able to
leave the palace since she became ill."
00:03:10.560,00:03:13.590,臣妾愿替皇上留于宫中陪伴太后,00:03:11.620,00:03:14.700,I would like to stay and attend Her Majesty.
00:03:13.960,00:03:16.750,尽心侍奉 以尽臣女孝道,00:03:14.920,00:03:18.000,"I will fulfill my filial piety to
Her Majesty through attentive service."
00:03:17.840,00:03:20.030,你有这样的孝心自然是好,00:03:18.780,00:03:21.080,I appreciate your filial thoughts.
00:03:20.680,00:03:21.660,多谢娘娘,00:03:21.720,00:03:23.620,I thank Your Majesty.
00:03:26.400,00:03:29.630,内务府都安排好了一切照旧,00:03:27.340,00:03:31.000,"The Imperial Household Department has

00:03:35.920,00:03:38.430,娘娘还是碧桐书院,00:03:36.920,00:03:40.020,Your Highness stays in Verdant Reading Hall.
00:03:41.240,00:03:42.750,安贵人不是住繁英阁吗,,,
00:03:43.280,00:03:44.190,怎么往这边走了,00:03:42.240,00:03:44.200,Doesn’t Noble Lady An stay in Lush Blossoms Chamber?
00:03:45.040,00:03:46.180,回娘娘的话,00:03:44.200,00:03:46.020,Why did she walk that way?
00:03:46.800,00:03:48.910,安贵人住在闲月阁了,00:03:46.040,00:03:47.880,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:03:47.880,00:03:50.500,Lady An will live in Leisured Moon Chamber.
00:03:49.720,00:03:50.990,皇上的意思,00:03:50.920,00:03:52.420,His Majesty says that
00:03:51.280,00:03:55.230,安贵人平日和娘娘交好亲厚,00:03:52.420,00:03:56.500,"Lady An is close to Your Highness, so your residences"

00:04:02.720,00:04:05.280,本宫还有事 就不去安贵人处了,00:04:03.600,00:04:06.560,"I have something else to attend to.
I will visit Lady An another time."
00:04:06.120,00:04:06.790,你先退下吧,,,
00:04:07.280,00:04:08.630,奴才告辞了,00:04:07.040,00:04:08.340,You may leave.
,,,00:04:08.340,00:04:10.280,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:04:18.720,00:04:21.470,小主是为惠贵人的事情伤感吗,00:04:19.760,00:04:20.720,"My Lady,"
,,,00:04:20.720,00:04:22.840,are you feeling sad about Lady Vertu?
00:04:22.880,00:04:24.550,昔年眉庄春风得意,00:04:23.760,00:04:25.980,"Last year, Meizhuang was in the prime of His Majesty's favor."
00:04:25.120,00:04:27.500,如今这闲月阁已是陵容在住,00:04:25.980,00:04:28.980,"But this year, Lingrong stays in Leisured Moon Chamber."
00:04:28.120,00:04:29.430,当真是物是人非,00:04:29.060,00:04:31.500,"Household items remain the same, but occupants change."
00:04:31.000,00:04:34.070,我怕我一过去 难免会触景伤情,00:04:31.840,00:04:33.620,"I fear that once I go there,"
,,,00:04:33.760,00:04:36.000,it will sadden me.
00:04:35.880,00:04:38.260,小主重视姐妹之情 甚是难得,00:04:36.860,00:04:39.640,It's kind of you to feel this way.
00:04:38.920,00:04:40.310,只是小主应该清楚,00:04:39.820,00:04:41.760,"But you should understand, My Lady,"
00:04:41.280,00:04:44.630,在这个宫中娘娘 小主多得很,00:04:41.840,00:04:45.720,there are many concubines in the palace.
00:04:45.480,00:04:48.070,今日你受宠 明日她受宠,00:04:46.360,00:04:49.420,"One may be favored today, and another one tomorrow."
00:04:51.920,00:04:52.830,并无定数,,,
00:04:53.600,00:04:55.110,小主虽然在意惠贵人,00:04:52.880,00:04:54.340,It is not certain.
00:04:56.040,00:04:57.710,也不必为此事过于伤感,00:04:54.600,00:04:56.380,"You care about Lady Vertu,"
,,,00:04:57.020,00:04:59.200,but you don’t need to feel sad about her.
00:04:59.680,00:05:00.310,槿汐,00:05:00.540,00:05:01.620,Jinxi.
00:05:01.760,00:05:04.220,我总是爱在这些小事上计较难过,00:05:02.740,00:05:05.520,I always worry too much over such trifles.
00:05:05.600,00:05:08.710,小主有时候是有些多愁善感,00:05:06.640,00:05:09.920,"My Lady, you are sentimental sometimes."
00:05:10.040,00:05:12.150,不过只有温柔善良的人,00:05:10.940,00:05:12.000,"However,"
00:05:12.520,00:05:13.550,才会如此多思呢,00:05:12.000,00:05:14.740,only a kind and gentle person would feel this way.
00:05:14.040,00:05:15.550,那冷酷之人是不会的,00:05:14.960,00:05:16.880,Cruel people would never.
00:05:17.120,00:05:18.390,小主的不足之处,,,
00:05:18.640,00:05:20.110,就在于心肠太柔软,00:05:18.140,00:05:21.240,Your shortcoming is that you are too soft-hearted.
00:05:20.560,00:05:21.750,为人顾忌太多,00:05:21.520,00:05:23.500,You have so much to care about.
00:05:23.520,00:05:24.230,莞娘娘,00:05:24.400,00:05:25.700,Your Highness!
00:05:25.560,00:05:26.310,莞娘娘,00:05:26.560,00:05:27.880,Your Highness!
00:05:28.200,00:05:30.110,四阿哥 你快下来快下来,00:05:29.100,00:05:31.200,"Fourth Prince, come down! Come down here!"
00:05:30.400,00:05:31.070,小心 别摔着,,,
00:05:31.560,00:05:32.230,快下来,00:05:31.240,00:05:32.340,Be careful not to fall.
,,,00:05:32.420,00:05:33.720,Come down here.
00:05:37.040,00:05:39.310,给娘娘请安 莞娘娘吉祥,00:05:37.880,00:05:40.400,Peace to Your Highness.
00:05:40.120,00:05:41.230,你怎么爬那么高啊,,,
00:05:41.760,00:05:42.590,也不怕跌着,00:05:41.060,00:05:42.540,Why did you climb up so high?
,,,00:05:42.680,00:05:44.080,Aren't you afraid of falling?
00:05:43.160,00:05:45.670,除了嬷嬷 没人这么关心我,00:05:44.080,00:05:46.700,"Except for my maids, no one cares about me."
00:05:46.120,00:05:46.870,傻孩子,00:05:46.980,00:05:47.980,Silly boy!
00:05:47.920,00:05:49.510,听说皇阿玛来这里了,,,
00:05:49.960,00:05:50.990,想给皇阿玛请安,00:05:48.860,00:05:50.960,"I heard that Father came here, and"
00:05:51.520,00:05:52.910,又怕皇阿玛不愿意见我,00:05:50.960,00:05:52.420,I want to pay my respects to him.
00:05:53.520,00:05:54.910,所以就爬到石头上,00:05:52.440,00:05:54.400,But I'm scared that he doesn’t want to see me.
00:05:55.240,00:05:57.350,想看看能不能看见皇阿玛,00:05:54.400,00:05:56.160,So I climbed up on the rocks
00:05:57.840,00:05:58.980,你想见你皇阿玛,00:05:56.180,00:05:58.440,hoping that I would see him.
00:05:59.280,00:06:00.310,我带你去见就是了,00:05:58.860,00:06:00.220,You want to see your father?
00:06:01.200,00:06:01.990,只是今日,00:06:00.220,00:06:01.740,I will bring you to visit him.
00:06:02.320,00:06:03.380,你皇阿玛正在和前朝,00:06:02.140,00:06:03.220,"But today,"
00:06:03.760,00:06:04.670,几位大人说话呢,00:06:03.280,00:06:05.640,His Majesty is meeting officials in court.
00:06:04.880,00:06:06.270,怕是一时半会儿停不了,00:06:05.780,00:06:07.560,I’m afraid he won’t finish anytime soon.
00:06:07.320,00:06:08.150,要不你先回去,,,
00:06:08.680,00:06:09.550,等皇上有空了,00:06:08.280,00:06:09.640,Why don't you go back?
00:06:09.840,00:06:11.230,我叫上你一同去见 好吗,00:06:09.640,00:06:11.680,"When His Majesty is available,
I will take you to him."
00:06:11.720,00:06:12.470,谢娘娘,00:06:11.680,00:06:12.620,All right?
,,,00:06:12.620,00:06:13.800,I thank Your Highness!
00:06:12.800,00:06:14.950,儿臣只要能见皇阿玛一面就好,00:06:13.800,00:06:16.060,I'll be happy just to see Father.
00:06:16.280,00:06:16.870,去吧,00:06:17.240,00:06:18.260,Go on.
00:06:19.080,00:06:20.910,对了 娘娘 这个给你,00:06:20.040,00:06:22.340,"Here, Your Highness, this is for you."
00:06:26.160,00:06:27.470,臣启皇上,00:06:27.040,00:06:28.600,"Your Majesty,"
00:06:28.520,00:06:31.630,年羹尧趁朝廷用兵之际,00:06:29.520,00:06:33.900,"Nian Gengyao took advantage of military
actions to claim false merits,"
00:06:31.840,00:06:34.140,虚冒军功 营私纳贿,,,
00:06:34.440,00:06:36.900,为其下属谋取高官厚禄,00:06:34.060,00:06:37.840,"and secretly accepted bribes to arrange
high-ranking posts for his subordinates."
00:06:37.440,00:06:40.630,而其下属则更是倚仗权势,00:06:38.380,00:06:42.840,His subordinates leaned on his power to act with impunity.
00:06:40.920,00:06:41.900,有恃无恐,,,
00:06:42.600,00:06:45.310,年羹尧未出籍的家奴魏之耀,00:06:43.480,00:06:46.320,Nian Gengyao's household servant Wei Zhiyao
00:06:45.640,00:06:46.670,一向煊赫,00:06:46.340,00:06:48.040,has been exceedingly arrogant.
00:06:47.280,00:06:48.390,其进京之时,00:06:48.280,00:06:49.740,"When he came to Beijing,"
00:06:49.160,00:06:51.350,竟至文官道旁作躬,00:06:49.740,00:06:52.200,all civil officials bowed to him
00:06:51.680,00:06:53.030,武官道旁跪拜,00:06:52.620,00:06:54.720,and all military officers knelt.
00:06:53.960,00:06:57.390,而魏之耀乘轿而过 全然不理,00:06:54.900,00:06:58.840,"But Wei Zhiyao passed by sitting on his sedan
without even looking at them."
00:06:57.840,00:07:02.390,足见其气势嚣张跋扈到何等地步,00:06:59.000,00:07:03.540,This demonstrates his arrogance and feelings of power.
00:07:03.320,00:07:03.950,皇上,00:07:04.140,00:07:04.840,"Your Majesty,"
00:07:04.760,00:07:07.220,年羹尧对我文武百官蛮横无理,00:07:05.320,00:07:08.540,Nian Gengyao exercises dominance over all the officials.
00:07:07.880,00:07:10.110,他以军前效力 学习理事为名,00:07:08.860,00:07:11.480,"On the pretext of training the military,"
00:07:10.600,00:07:12.390,扣押大量文武百官的子弟,,,
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.350,在他幕中,00:07:11.540,00:07:14.640,he detains many children of officials in his encampment.
00:07:13.920,00:07:15.910,川北总兵王允吉退职后,00:07:14.900,00:07:17.400,"After Wang Yun, the General of North Sichuan retired,"
00:07:16.640,00:07:18.750,年羹尧令其送一子,,,
00:07:19.120,00:07:20.260,在他军前效力,00:07:17.660,00:07:21.500,Nian Gengyao ordered his son to serve in his own regiment:
00:07:20.840,00:07:22.910,名为效力 实为人质,00:07:21.500,00:07:24.420,"requested in the name of service,
but truly held as a hostage."
00:07:23.640,00:07:25.710,迫使文武百官依附自己,00:07:24.640,00:07:27.000,This is how he forces officials to obey him.
00:07:26.120,00:07:26.830,好了,00:07:27.080,00:07:27.780,Enough.
00:07:32.800,00:07:34.070,兹事体大,00:07:33.780,00:07:35.760,This matter is of paramount significance.
00:07:35.160,00:07:37.230,今日先议到这儿,00:07:36.160,00:07:38.420,Let's end it here today.
00:07:37.920,00:07:42.430,明日让张廷玉 隆科多来见朕,00:07:38.740,00:07:43.380,Inform Zhang Tingyu and Longkodo to see me tomorrow.
00:07:43.240,00:07:44.380,你们跪安吧,00:07:44.040,00:07:45.480,You may leave.
00:07:45.800,00:07:47.390,谢皇上,00:07:46.660,00:07:48.480,I thank Your Majesty.
00:07:55.000,00:07:55.630,娘娘,,,
00:07:55.920,00:07:56.550,皇上呢,00:07:55.940,00:07:56.800,Your Highness.
,,,00:07:57.020,00:07:58.420,Where is His Majesty?
00:07:57.680,00:08:00.790,皇上说今日不能来陪娘娘用膳了,00:07:58.720,00:08:01.900,His Majesty says that he is unable to dine with Your Highness.
00:08:01.360,00:08:02.470,请娘娘自便吧,00:08:02.300,00:08:04.000,Please dine without him.
00:08:03.400,00:08:06.670,还有 皇上说这两日朝政繁忙,00:08:04.400,00:08:05.540,"What’s more,"
,,,00:08:05.540,00:08:07.820,His Majesty said he anticipates being very busy
00:08:07.160,00:08:09.270,恐怕都不能来陪娘娘了,00:08:08.100,00:08:10.620,and might not be able to accompany Your Highness.
00:08:11.480,00:08:12.700,奴才先告退,00:08:12.420,00:08:14.080,Allow me to take my leave.
00:08:15.040,00:08:15.630,起开,00:08:16.020,00:08:17.360,Stay away!
00:08:21.440,00:08:22.750,本宫仔仔细细地,,,
00:08:23.040,00:08:24.350,询问了皇上身边的人,00:08:22.440,00:08:25.700,I carefully inquired of His Majesty's servants.
00:08:26.440,00:08:27.710,原来是甄远道他们,,,
00:08:28.000,00:08:29.550,弹勤了哥哥和下属,00:08:27.460,00:08:31.360,"It turns out that Zhen Yuandao led an impeachment
against my brother and his subordinates."
00:08:31.760,00:08:33.270,皇上已经派刑部,,,
00:08:33.680,00:08:34.870,查处了魏之耀所贪污的,00:08:32.560,00:08:34.780,His Majesty has ordered the Ministry of Justice
00:08:35.200,00:08:36.310,几十万两家产,00:08:34.780,00:08:37.540,"to seize the hundreds of thousands of taels
embezzled by Wei Zhiyao."
00:08:37.640,00:08:39.270,说他是仆以主富,00:08:38.560,00:08:40.820,"His Majesty said he gained his wealth
only because of his master"
00:08:40.080,00:08:42.510,说哥哥仗着总督私自牟利,00:08:40.940,00:08:44.120,"and that my brother abused his position to fill his own pockets,"
00:08:43.240,00:08:45.030,倚仗下属中饱私囊,00:08:44.300,00:08:46.740,which overflowed into those of his subordinates.
00:08:47.320,00:08:49.070,皇上最恨一个贪字,00:08:48.420,00:08:50.540,His Majesty despises corruption most of all.
00:08:50.040,00:08:51.830,他们怎么做事那么不当心,,,
00:08:52.160,00:08:53.470,非要惹皇上不痛快,00:08:51.000,00:08:54.540,Why were they so careless as to provoke His Majesty?
00:08:54.440,00:08:56.270,都是甄远道多事多口,00:08:55.340,00:08:57.800,Zhen Yuandao's mouth never stops causing trouble.
00:08:57.280,00:08:58.630,甄远道是为了帮她女儿,,,
00:08:58.920,00:09:00.110,才处处跟本宫作对,00:08:58.280,00:09:01.500,"He wants to help his daughter, and so he is against me."
00:09:01.560,00:09:05.180,也不知道皇上会不会迁怒于哥哥,00:09:02.380,00:09:04.040,I don’t know whether His Majesty
00:09:06.920,00:09:08.550,到底是些奴才们的小事,00:09:04.700,00:09:06.140,will also turn his anger on my brother.
00:09:08.960,00:09:10.630,也还不至于牵扯到年大将军,00:09:07.740,00:09:09.820,These are small matters among some subordinates.
00:09:11.800,00:09:12.940,而且以前也有过一些,00:09:10.020,00:09:12.060,General Nian surely wasn’t involved.
00:09:13.200,00:09:15.470,不知死活的蠢货弹勤过年大将军,00:09:12.860,00:09:16.660,"Formerly there were some brazen fools who
tried to impeach General Nian,"
00:09:16.160,00:09:17.790,还不都受了皇上的训斥,00:09:17.140,00:09:19.400,but they were all rebuked by His Majesty.
00:09:18.680,00:09:21.060,正因为皇上从前都是护着哥哥,00:09:19.680,00:09:22.100,His Majesty always trusted my brother
00:09:21.560,00:09:22.870,训斥弹勤之人,,,
00:09:24.080,00:09:25.220,如今却派人去询问,00:09:22.520,00:09:24.660,and rebuked those who reprimanded him.
00:09:25.520,00:09:27.870,哥哥是否知道魏之耀贪污之事,00:09:25.100,00:09:29.320,"But this time His Majesty has sent people to investigate
whether my brother knew of Wei Zhiyao's corruption."
00:09:30.160,00:09:31.790,岂非对哥哥起了疑心,00:09:31.120,00:09:33.220,Does His Majesty suspect my brother?
,,,00:09:33.460,00:09:34.120,"Your Highness,"
00:09:32.480,00:09:37.270,娘娘 皇上循例问问也是有的,00:09:35.340,00:09:38.460,It is only normal that His Majesty inquires.
00:09:39.560,00:09:40.830,哥哥手底下的人,,,
00:09:41.280,00:09:42.670,还想替魏之耀瞒着,00:09:40.460,00:09:43.740,"But my brother’s subordinates tried to
cover up for Wei Zhiyao."
00:09:43.160,00:09:44.070,能瞒得住吗,00:09:44.080,00:09:45.400,How could they?
00:09:45.720,00:09:47.390,如今皇上以为哥哥手下的人,,,
00:09:47.680,00:09:49.110,官官相护 自成一党,00:09:46.620,00:09:50.240,"Now His Majesty thinks that my brother’s
subordinates formed a faction to shield one another."
00:09:49.640,00:09:51.590,才会派人去询问哥哥,00:09:50.480,00:09:52.820,That’s why His Majesty sends people to investigate.
00:09:54.280,00:09:55.310,难怪,00:09:55.180,00:09:56.080,No wonder …
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.830,难怪皇上近日都不来本宫这儿,00:09:58.660,00:10:01.220,No wonder why His Majesty doesn’t come these days.
00:10:02.080,00:10:03.590,怕是也迁怒了本宫,00:10:03.100,00:10:05.400,I’m afraid he's also turned his anger on me.
00:10:05.320,00:10:06.380,娘娘别伤心,00:10:06.200,00:10:07.800,"Don’t be sad, Your Highness."
00:10:07.320,00:10:09.590,娘娘现在想见皇上一面都难,00:10:08.240,00:10:10.620,It is difficult for Your Highness to see His Majesty right now.
00:10:10.040,00:10:12.630,所以以后更不能替大将军分辩了,00:10:10.860,00:10:14.240,"In the future, Your Highness should refrain
 from speaking about the Great General."
00:10:14.120,00:10:15.260,那如今怎么办,00:10:15.100,00:10:16.120,What can I do now?
00:10:16.920,00:10:20.620,人人能说的话 本宫却不能说,00:10:17.840,00:10:19.540,"Everyone can speak about it,"
,,,00:10:20.180,00:10:21.680,everyone but me.
00:10:21.760,00:10:25.230,娘娘 奴才觉得为今之计,00:10:22.660,00:10:23.820,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:10:24.060,00:10:26.140,"I think, the plan for now,"
00:10:26.360,00:10:29.750,娘娘就不能再让皇上迁怒于您了,00:10:27.320,00:10:30.840,is to avoid making His Majesty angry with Your Highness.
00:10:30.680,00:10:33.430,那 让曹贵人替本宫开口,,,
00:10:33.840,00:10:34.590,不妥,00:10:33.000,00:10:34.760,"Then, let Lady Cao speak for me."
,,,00:10:34.780,00:10:35.900,It's not appropriate.
00:10:35.320,00:10:38.230,这曹贵人一向不是皇上最宠的,00:10:36.320,00:10:39.200,Noble Lady Cao is never in high favor with His Majesty.
00:10:38.600,00:10:40.470,她也不是皇上心尖子上的人,00:10:39.520,00:10:41.800,She is also not at the center of His Majesty's heart.
00:10:41.200,00:10:43.950,恐怕不便开口吧,00:10:42.160,00:10:43.440,I'm afraid ...
,,,00:10:43.960,00:10:46.280,it's not appropriate for her to speak up.
00:10:45.640,00:10:47.150,本宫不能说的话,00:10:46.460,00:10:47.760,"If I can't speak for myself,"
00:10:48.720,00:10:50.510,还得安排个人在皇上身边,00:10:49.620,00:10:52.220,I will need someone to gain favor from His Majesty
00:10:51.840,00:10:52.980,替本宫开口,00:10:52.760,00:10:54.660,and speak for me.
00:11:26.320,00:11:29.550,皇上 魏之耀严火之事还是小事,00:11:27.280,00:11:28.220,"Your Majesty,"
00:11:30.080,00:11:30.870,臣已查明,00:11:28.220,00:11:30.920,"the missteps of Wei Zhiyao are small
compared to other matters."
00:11:31.320,00:11:33.510,年羹尧派家人四处经商,00:11:31.040,00:11:32.440,My investigation clearly shows
00:11:33.800,00:11:34.510,牟取暴利,00:11:32.440,00:11:35.660,"Nian Gengyao used his family to seek
exorbitant profits through business."
00:11:34.920,00:11:37.110,年羹尧之子年富 年斌,00:11:35.900,00:11:37.260,"Nian Gengyao's sons,"
00:11:37.560,00:11:39.710,偏编名色 私占盐池,00:11:37.260,00:11:38.620,"Nian Fu and Nian Bin,"
,,,00:11:38.620,00:11:40.880,falsified documents to take ownership of salt pools.
00:11:40.280,00:11:44.510,这两年获取暴利超过十七万两,00:11:41.300,00:11:45.900,They have made a profit of more than one hundred seventy thousand taels in the last two years.
00:11:45.080,00:11:47.710,如此种种 只是九牛一毛,00:11:46.020,00:11:48.980,"This is only ""one hair of a bull's back""
compared to what they have done."
00:11:48.400,00:11:49.460,按大清惯例,00:11:49.380,00:11:50.640,"As Qing Dynasty's law prescribes,"
00:11:50.120,00:11:53.430,我朝大将军 督抚往来都用咨文,00:11:51.100,00:11:55.360,"generals and governors should communicate
in the format of a Counsel Letter."
00:11:53.680,00:11:54.510,以示平等,,,
00:11:54.960,00:11:56.670,年羹尧却擅用令谕,00:11:55.920,00:11:58.220,"But, without permission, Nian Gengyao sends Command Orders"
00:11:57.360,00:11:59.110,直书将军 督抚官名,00:11:58.260,00:12:00.720,to his subordinate generals and governors
00:12:00.120,00:12:01.390,语气一如皇上,00:12:01.100,00:12:02.920,in the tone of an emperor.
00:12:02.320,00:12:05.230,年羹尧出资刻印的陆宣公奏议,00:12:03.280,00:12:06.540,"Nian Gengyao endowed publishing
""Sir Lu Zhi's Memorials to Emperor Dezong"""
00:12:05.720,00:12:08.630,曾请皇上替此书写一篇序言,00:12:06.720,00:12:09.940,and entreated Your Majesty to write a preface for the book.
00:12:09.600,00:12:10.310,几日前,00:12:10.600,00:12:12.140,"However, several days ago,"
00:12:11.000,00:12:13.870,年羹尧却以不敢上烦圣心为名,00:12:12.160,00:12:14.980,"on the pretext of saving Your Majesty the bother,"
00:12:14.320,00:12:16.110,替皇上拟写了一份序言,00:12:15.240,00:12:17.520,he wrote the preface himself
00:12:16.840,00:12:18.470,并颁发于天下,00:12:17.780,00:12:19.860,and published it to the people.

00:12:59.760,00:13:02.590,皇上 年羹尧僧越至此,00:13:00.680,00:13:01.340,"Your Majesty,"
00:13:03.200,00:13:04.550,实属大逆不道,00:13:02.000,00:13:03.680,Nian Gengyao's arrogant behavior

00:13:26.760,00:13:29.030,皇上 这是新到的雨前龙井,00:13:27.740,00:13:30.240,"Your Majesty, this is the latest Longjing tea."
00:13:29.480,00:13:30.540,请皇上品茶,00:13:30.380,00:13:31.560,Please have a taste.
00:13:30.840,00:13:32.550,没问你 多嘴,00:13:31.740,00:13:32.360,Quiet.
,,,00:13:32.760,00:13:34.080,You were not spoken to.

00:13:38.760,00:13:41.950,颂芝 是你啊,00:13:39.600,00:13:40.760,Song Zhi ...
00:13:42.320,00:13:43.830,奴婢奉华妃娘娘之命,00:13:42.080,00:13:43.000,It's you.
00:13:44.120,00:13:45.340,侍奉皇上用茶,00:13:43.300,00:13:46.700,"I obey Her Highness Consort Flour's order
to serve Your Majesty the tea."
00:13:51.240,00:13:52.460,你这身衣服不错,00:13:52.120,00:13:53.660,This dress looks nice on you.
00:13:58.040,00:13:59.230,奴才告退,,,
00:13:59.480,00:14:00.540,臣告退,00:13:58.960,00:14:00.700,Allow me to take my leave.

00:14:05.240,00:14:07.800,你说是华妃让你来的,00:14:06.220,00:14:08.780,You said that Consort Flour sent you here.
00:14:20.160,00:14:21.550,华妃娘娘吉祥,,,
00:14:21.800,00:14:22.510,两位大人好,00:14:21.220,00:14:22.440,Peace to Your Highness.
00:14:25.520,00:14:26.230,起来吧,00:14:22.440,00:14:23.540,"Greetings, ministers."
00:14:27.440,00:14:28.270,谢皇上,00:14:26.520,00:14:27.580,You may rise.
,,,00:14:28.420,00:14:29.760,I thank Your Majesty.
00:14:33.960,00:14:35.020,皇上请用茶,00:14:34.880,00:14:36.460,"Your Majesty, please have the tea."
00:14:55.040,00:14:55.670,娘娘,00:14:56.040,00:14:57.040,Your Highness.
00:14:56.520,00:14:59.190,娘娘日寸候不早了,00:14:57.500,00:14:58.520,"Your Highness,"
00:15:00.080,00:15:02.190,奴才估计颂芝姑娘,00:14:59.140,00:15:00.540,it's been a while.
00:15:02.840,00:15:04.670,今儿大概是不会出来了,00:15:01.100,00:15:05.760,I believe Song Zhi will stay here today.
00:15:05.160,00:15:06.350,娘娘先请回吧,00:15:06.200,00:15:07.520,Your Highness can leave if you wish.
00:15:10.280,00:15:11.110,谢谢苏公公,00:15:11.260,00:15:12.720,"Thank you, Mr. Su."
00:15:12.120,00:15:13.750,是娘娘您有眼光啊,00:15:13.060,00:15:15.120,Your Highness has a keen eye for beauty.
00:15:14.440,00:15:17.590,这才能让颂芝姑娘入了皇上的眼,00:15:15.420,00:15:18.620,That's why His Majesty appreciates Song Zhi.
00:15:52.800,00:15:54.750,娘娘 您还不睡吗,00:15:53.800,00:15:56.140,"Your Highness, you haven't slept yet?"
00:16:00.120,00:16:02.910,从前曹贵人和丽嫔依附本宫,00:16:01.240,00:16:04.040,"In the past, Lady Cao and Concubine Beauté
were seeking my support"
00:16:04.360,00:16:05.630,本宫也提拔她们,00:16:05.320,00:16:06.920,and I aided in their promotion.
00:16:09.240,00:16:11.750,但是把女人送到皇上床上去,00:16:10.260,00:16:13.100,But to send a woman to His Majesty's bed ...
00:16:14.800,00:16:16.230,本宫还是头一回,00:16:15.720,00:16:17.320,It's the first time.
00:16:18.080,00:16:19.390,娘娘也是不得已,00:16:19.160,00:16:21.000,Your Highness had your reasons to do so.
00:16:22.280,00:16:24.910,本宫此刻多希望颂芝回来,00:16:23.220,00:16:26.420,How I wish Song Zhi would come back
00:16:27.160,00:16:30.830,说皇上不喜欢她 让她离开,00:16:28.260,00:16:30.260,and tell me that His Majesty didn't like her
,,,00:16:30.820,00:16:32.500,so she was told to leave.
00:16:33.600,00:16:34.910,但真若如此,00:16:34.560,00:16:36.060,"But if that happens,"
00:16:37.080,00:16:38.550,又于大计无益,00:16:37.920,00:16:39.860,it's not good for the greater plan.
00:16:44.960,00:16:45.630,下去,00:16:45.900,00:16:46.760,Go out.
00:16:56.080,00:16:57.350,你伺候得很周到,00:16:56.820,00:16:58.540,I appreciate your service.
00:16:59.720,00:17:01.510,奴婢不敢忘了自己的身份,00:17:00.700,00:17:02.800,I dare not forget my position.
00:17:02.920,00:17:06.310,你既提到身份 朕不能委屈了你,00:17:03.900,00:17:05.180,"Speaking of your position,"
,,,00:17:06.100,00:17:07.340,I cannot make you feel aggrieved.
00:17:07.640,00:17:09.390,你是华妃身边的人,00:17:08.600,00:17:10.600,"You are Consort Fleur's maid,"
00:17:09.760,00:17:10.900,朕也不能薄待了你,00:17:10.660,00:17:12.580,so I need to treat you generously.
00:17:11.800,00:17:14.070,就破例从答应做起,00:17:12.620,00:17:13.760,I will make an exception and
,,,00:17:14.120,00:17:15.020,"grant you the rank of Companion,"
00:17:15.120,00:17:16.990,不必从官女子开始熬了,00:17:16.140,00:17:18.380,instead of starting from Escort.
00:17:19.000,00:17:19.830,谢皇上,,,
00:17:21.240,00:17:22.590,去给华妃磕个头,00:17:19.980,00:17:21.400,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:23.200,00:17:24.510,她好歹是你的主子,00:17:22.220,00:17:24.060,Remember to kowtow to Consort Flour.
,,,00:17:24.160,00:17:25.860,She was your master after all.
00:17:26.520,00:17:28.150,该谢她提携之恩,00:17:27.460,00:17:29.680,You should thank her for promoting you.
00:17:30.320,00:17:30.870,是,00:17:31.200,00:17:31.820,Yes.
00:17:56.840,00:17:59.710,娘娘 奴婢试过了 水温正好,00:17:57.740,00:17:58.440,"Your Highness,"
00:18:00.120,00:18:01.590,玫瑰花水也兑进去了,00:17:58.740,00:18:00.780,I've tested - the water temperature is comfortable.
00:18:02.240,00:18:03.710,奴婢伺候您洗脸吧,00:18:01.080,00:18:03.080,I've added the rose extract.
,,,00:18:03.200,00:18:05.580,"Please allow me to serve
Your Highness as you wash your face."
00:18:39.600,00:18:40.350,回来了,00:18:40.540,00:18:41.960,You are back.
00:18:41.600,00:18:45.030,皇上有没有赐你官女子的位分,00:18:42.560,00:18:43.960,Did His Majesty
,,,00:18:43.960,00:18:46.120,give you the rank of Escort?
00:18:48.000,00:18:49.470,皇上看重娘娘,00:18:49.020,00:18:50.640,His Majesty holds Your Highness in great esteem
00:18:49.800,00:18:52.430,赐了奴婢答应的位分,00:18:50.920,00:18:51.980,"and so, granted me"
,,,00:18:52.280,00:18:54.040,the rank of Companion.
00:19:01.040,00:19:03.870,难得皇上这么给你脸面,00:19:01.940,00:19:04.720,That is quite an honor.
00:19:05.200,00:19:08.670,想必皇上一定很喜欢你,00:19:06.200,00:19:08.100,I assume that His Majesty ...
00:19:10.280,00:19:11.230,奴婢能有今日,00:19:08.600,00:19:10.120,likes you very much.
00:19:11.600,00:19:12.950,全因皇上顾惜娘娘,00:19:11.240,00:19:14.060,"The only reason I was promoted is that Your Highness
holds a prominent place in His Majesty's heart."
00:19:13.360,00:19:14.670,皇上亲口对奴婢说,00:19:14.460,00:19:15.700,His Majesty told me that
00:19:14.920,00:19:16.630,因为奴婢是娘娘身边的人,00:19:15.940,00:19:17.640,I am Your Highness's servant
00:19:16.920,00:19:18.390,所以不能薄待了奴婢,00:19:17.780,00:19:19.300,so he wouldn't treat me humbly.
00:19:18.560,00:19:22.180,好了 如今都是正经的小主了,00:19:19.640,00:19:20.300,All right.
,,,00:19:21.300,00:19:23.060,You are a concubine now.
00:19:23.360,00:19:26.870,别一口一个奴婢 作践了自己,00:19:24.380,00:19:25.960,"From now on,"
,,,00:19:26.700,00:19:28.360,stop calling yourself a servant.
00:19:30.240,00:19:31.870,皇上让你住哪儿啊,00:19:31.340,00:19:33.240,Where did His Majesty assign you to live?
00:19:32.320,00:19:33.150,皇上说了,00:19:33.340,00:19:34.280,"His Majesty said,"
00:19:33.680,00:19:35.430,因为奴婢是娘娘身边的人,00:19:34.640,00:19:36.440,"since I have always lived with Your Highness,"
00:19:35.760,00:19:37.350,所以还叫跟着娘娘住,00:19:36.760,00:19:38.660,I will continue living with Your Highness.
00:19:45.760,00:19:47.070,奴婢虽然承蒙圣恩,00:19:46.680,00:19:48.180,His Majesty bestowed grace upon me
00:19:47.640,00:19:49.390,但一切皆因娘娘的提拔,00:19:48.540,00:19:50.480,only because Your Highness promoted me.
00:19:50.200,00:19:51.710,不管奴婢是宫女也好,,,
00:19:51.960,00:19:52.830,是小主也好,00:19:51.260,00:19:53.820,"Whether I am a maid or concubine,"
00:19:53.920,00:19:55.670,奴婢始终都是娘娘的奴婢,00:19:54.920,00:19:57.040,I will always be Your Highness's servant.
00:20:09.000,00:20:09.790,起来吧,00:20:09.980,00:20:11.160,Rise.
00:20:10.960,00:20:12.750,你既承恩 又不忘本,00:20:11.840,00:20:14.120,You received favor and didn't forget your origins.
00:20:13.400,00:20:15.780,本宫今后自会把你当妹妹一样,00:20:14.380,00:20:16.800,I will treat you like a sister of mine.
00:20:16.760,00:20:18.950,让周宁海把西间打扫一下,00:20:17.760,00:20:20.020,"Inform Zhou Ninghai to clean the west chamber,"
00:20:20.000,00:20:21.790,再派两个人伺候着你吧,00:20:21.080,00:20:22.880,and select two maids to serve you.
00:20:24.160,00:20:25.110,多谢娘娘,00:20:25.160,00:20:26.520,I am grateful to Your Highness.
00:20:27.840,00:20:28.980,下去歇着吧,,,
00:20:29.400,00:20:30.620,让别人伺候就行了,00:20:28.920,00:20:30.020,Go and take some rest.
,,,00:20:30.340,00:20:32.120,I will have someone else serve me.
00:20:33.520,00:20:35.390,奴婢伺候娘娘伺候惯了,00:20:34.460,00:20:36.800,I am accustomed to serving Your Highness.
00:20:36.280,00:20:38.790,让奴婢替娘娘上妆梳头吧,00:20:37.220,00:20:39.860,Please let me help Your Highness get ready.
00:20:42.480,00:20:44.070,难得你有这份心,00:20:43.420,00:20:45.280,I appreciate your thoughts.

00:20:52.600,00:20:53.710,不去皇后那里,00:20:53.560,00:20:54.840,I will not visit the Empress.
,,,00:20:55.060,00:20:55.560,Yes.
00:20:54.080,00:20:57.550,嗻 那皇上您是回九州清晏用膳,00:20:56.380,00:20:58.560,Would Your Majesty like to dine in Jiuzhou Qingyan or ...
00:20:57.800,00:20:58.550,去华妃那里,00:20:58.560,00:21:00.020,I'll dine with Consort Fleur.

00:21:03.720,00:21:05.830,你是不是觉得朕心性不定,,,
00:21:06.160,00:21:07.030,喜怒无常啊,00:21:04.620,00:21:07.940,Do you think my mood is fickle?
00:21:07.760,00:21:10.550,皇上 您是一国之君哪,00:21:08.440,00:21:11.520,Your Majesty is the monarch of the country.

00:21:12.840,00:21:13.820,这是应该的,00:21:13.660,00:21:15.020,and we will follow.
00:21:15.880,00:21:18.310,朕有日子没去华妃那儿了,00:21:16.840,00:21:19.500,It has been long since last time I visited her.
00:21:19.520,00:21:21.870,华妃娘娘已变得贤惠了,00:21:20.460,00:21:22.820,Her Highness has cultivated her virtues.
00:21:22.400,00:21:25.630,她要给朕看她的贤惠 朕就看看,00:21:23.340,00:21:26.580,"She wants me to see her virtues,

00:21:34.640,00:21:36.310,皇上可有日子没来了,00:21:35.760,00:21:37.580,Your Majesty has not come for some time.
00:21:38.480,00:21:39.540,前朝事忙,00:21:39.360,00:21:41.320,I've been occupied with the issues in court.
00:21:40.640,00:21:42.390,自然有些疏忽 你要体谅,00:21:41.720,00:21:43.900,You have to understand.
00:21:46.640,00:21:48.670,芝答应 你也坐吧,00:21:47.600,00:21:49.940,"Companion Zhi, take a seat."

00:22:17.600,00:22:20.790,这是哥哥送来的 说是淡雅质朴,00:22:18.480,00:22:20.200,My brother sent this set to me.
,,,00:22:20.420,00:22:22.100,He said it's simple and elegant.
00:22:23.400,00:22:25.630,难得他不喜奢侈,00:22:24.340,00:22:26.640,I'm glad that he appreciates simplicity.
00:22:26.080,00:22:27.110,哥哥常这样说,00:22:26.920,00:22:28.340,My brother often says
00:22:27.960,00:22:30.910,富贵来得不易 不能轻易挥霍,00:22:29.100,00:22:32.220,"""Wealth is a rarity and must not be squandered."""
00:22:32.120,00:22:33.670,只是哥哥身处高位,00:22:33.080,00:22:34.920,My brother holds a high post.
00:22:34.520,00:22:36.510,又得皇上圣恩隆重,00:22:35.560,00:22:37.820,He is also deeply honored by Your Majesty's grace.
00:22:37.680,00:22:39.670,难免有人会妒忌陷害,00:22:38.660,00:22:40.900,"It's inevitable that some would
defame him out of jealousy."
00:22:42.400,00:22:47.030,华妃 前朝的事朕自有分寸,00:22:43.320,00:22:44.520,"Consort Fleur,"
,,,00:22:45.860,00:22:48.060,I know what is proper in governance of the state.
00:22:48.560,00:22:50.070,你在朕身边多年,00:22:49.460,00:22:51.120,You have been serving me all these years.
00:22:50.400,00:22:51.870,应该知道哪些话能置嚎,00:22:51.360,00:22:52.880,"You should understand
which matters you can comment on"
00:22:52.200,00:22:53.030,哪些不能,00:22:53.040,00:22:54.200,and which you cannot.
00:22:54.240,00:22:55.030,是,00:22:55.280,00:22:56.480,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:22:57.080,00:22:58.190,皇上用完膳了,00:22:58.120,00:22:59.540,Your Majesty has finished.
00:22:58.760,00:23:01.990,不如让芝答应伺候皇上午睡吧,00:22:59.720,00:23:00.400,"Perhaps,"
,,,00:23:00.900,00:23:02.900,Companion Zhi can accompany Your Majesty to rest?
00:23:04.280,00:23:07.430,好啊 正好朕也乏了,00:23:05.080,00:23:05.880,Very well.
,,,00:23:06.360,00:23:08.460,"I am pretty tired, myself."
00:23:07.800,00:23:08.860,去芝答应屋里吧,00:23:08.720,00:23:10.300,I'll go to Companion Zhi's chamber.
00:23:11.760,00:23:12.390,是,00:23:12.680,00:23:13.440,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:23:14.080,00:23:15.470,华妃要举荐人也好,00:23:15.120,00:23:17.360,"There's nothing wrong with Consort Fleur
presenting concubines to His Majesty."
00:23:16.600,00:23:18.270,怎么选了身边的宫女呀,00:23:17.600,00:23:19.460,But why did she choose her maid?
00:23:19.520,00:23:22.030,华妃生怕日后再度失宠,00:23:20.520,00:23:23.220,Consort Fleur was afraid to lose favor again.
00:23:22.560,00:23:25.390,其实自从失去丽嫔帮助后,00:23:23.560,00:23:24.340,"In fact,"
00:23:25.720,00:23:27.230,她便已有心栽培人手,00:23:24.720,00:23:26.500,"after losing Concubine Beauté,"
,,,00:23:26.640,00:23:28.620,she wanted to foster new concubines.
00:23:28.120,00:23:30.270,只是她不愿用高门官宦的女子,00:23:28.980,00:23:31.580,But she didn't want a lady from a distinguished family.
00:23:30.920,00:23:33.270,怕日后分宠太甚 不好驾驭,00:23:31.740,00:23:34.260,"She feared she would lose control
if they gained too much favor."
00:23:33.560,00:23:34.700,因此才选了颂芝,,,
00:23:35.240,00:23:36.830,也算是知根知底的人,00:23:34.540,00:23:36.120,So she selected Song Zhi.
,,,00:23:36.300,00:23:38.240,At least Consort Fleur knows her thoroughly.
00:23:37.880,00:23:41.110,颂芝可否成大器 姐姐可曾留心,00:23:38.720,00:23:40.560,Can Song Zhi become a powerful instrument?
00:23:42.040,00:23:43.430,娘娘想听真话吗,00:23:40.940,00:23:42.660,Did you ever pay attention to her?
,,,00:23:43.060,00:23:44.960,Does Your Highness wish to hear the truth?
00:23:45.200,00:23:47.580,华妃这次太心急了,00:23:46.260,00:23:48.780,Consort Fluer made an impetuous decision.
00:23:49.720,00:23:50.430,怎么说,00:23:50.640,00:23:52.080,Why do you say that?
00:23:52.240,00:23:54.750,颂芝确实有几分小聪明,00:23:53.180,00:23:55.580,Song Zhi does have her cleverness
00:23:55.040,00:23:55.950,也颇有姿色,00:23:55.740,00:23:57.040,and a pretty face.
00:23:56.480,00:23:59.110,可她太过畏惧华妃 太听话了,00:23:57.400,00:24:00.280,But she is so afraid of and obedient to Consort Fleur.
00:23:59.600,00:24:01.670,因此不足以成大器,00:24:00.580,00:24:02.740,that she can't pose any threat.
00:24:03.000,00:24:04.310,华妃想用颂芝,00:24:04.080,00:24:05.320,Consort Fleur wanted Song Zhi
00:24:04.600,00:24:06.230,来分您和安贵人的恩宠,00:24:05.560,00:24:07.400,"to share His Majesty's favor
from Your Highness and Lady An."
00:24:06.720,00:24:08.470,实在不是明智之举,00:24:07.620,00:24:09.520,It's not a sensible decision.
00:24:09.520,00:24:11.710,我从未想过一个颂芝可以抗衡,00:24:10.480,00:24:12.920,I never thought that Song Zhi could contend against me.
00:24:12.840,00:24:14.630,华妃也算是黔驴技穷了,00:24:14.020,00:24:16.240,"It appears that all Consort Fleur's tricks
have been exhausted."
00:24:15.760,00:24:16.740,若是在以前,,,
00:24:17.440,00:24:18.550,她绝对不会允许,00:24:16.740,00:24:18.220,"In the past,"
00:24:18.840,00:24:20.310,身边有姿色的侍女,,,
00:24:20.600,00:24:22.070,贸然地接近皇上,00:24:18.380,00:24:22.980,"Consort Fleur would never allow
any maids to get close to His Majesty."
00:24:22.880,00:24:24.190,可到了今时今日 她也,00:24:23.800,00:24:25.060,"But today, she ..."
00:24:24.520,00:24:25.500,华妃自己也知道,00:24:25.220,00:24:26.580,Even she knows that
00:24:26.920,00:24:28.670,今时不同往日了,00:24:27.900,00:24:29.760,today is different from the past.
00:24:29.000,00:24:31.350,是 娘娘您的父亲,00:24:29.960,00:24:30.920,Of course.
00:24:31.720,00:24:33.830,带头弹勤年羹尧和他的家奴,00:24:31.140,00:24:32.580,Your Highness's father
,,,00:24:32.700,00:24:35.180,led the impeachment of Nian Gengyao and his servants
00:24:34.520,00:24:37.830,这每一本都正中年氏要害,00:24:35.560,00:24:38.840,hitting him where it hurts most.
00:24:41.520,00:24:43.350,娘娘 皇上今儿一早,00:24:42.500,00:24:43.300,"Your Majesty,"
00:24:43.640,00:24:45.430,就封了华妃身边的一个宫女,00:24:43.540,00:24:46.620,This morning His Majesty promoted one of Consort Fleur's maids ...
00:24:46.120,00:24:46.870,为答应,00:24:47.060,00:24:48.080,to Companion.
00:24:48.240,00:24:50.950,宫女晋封也该从官女子开始,00:24:49.140,00:24:52.060,Maids should be promoted to Escort first.
00:24:51.800,00:24:54.310,怎么没听皇上说什么时候临幸的,00:24:52.780,00:24:55.280,Why didn't His Majesty tell me when she served him?
00:24:55.040,00:24:56.180,就昨晚的事,00:24:56.020,00:24:57.720,She served His Majesty last night.
00:24:57.000,00:24:59.790,奴婢觉得这根本不符合规矩,00:24:57.900,00:25:01.160,I consider it against the imperial rules.
00:25:00.520,00:25:02.630,规矩也是皇上定的规矩,00:25:01.540,00:25:03.760,It is the emperors who made the rules.
00:25:03.960,00:25:06.190,宫里也很久没有新宠了,00:25:04.940,00:25:07.340,There hasn't been a new concubine for a long time.
00:25:06.920,00:25:08.060,要封就封吧,00:25:07.920,00:25:09.180,Let it be.
00:25:11.400,00:25:12.430,你怎么梳的,00:25:12.340,00:25:13.920,What are you doing?
00:25:13.360,00:25:14.310,梳好一点,00:25:14.200,00:25:15.640,Comb my hair carefully!
00:25:18.960,00:25:19.830,天气这么热,,,
00:25:20.040,00:25:21.550,幸好娘娘带咱们去看戏,00:25:19.780,00:25:20.740,The weather is so hot.
00:25:21.920,00:25:22.870,是皇上有心,00:25:20.740,00:25:22.700,"Fortunately, Her Highness has invited us to the opera house."
00:25:23.200,00:25:24.470,惦记着咱们爱看戏,00:25:22.740,00:25:25.540,"It‘s His Majesty who remembered
that we enjoy watching operas."
00:25:24.840,00:25:26.060,一早出来便这么热,00:25:25.820,00:25:27.440,It's already so hot in the morning.
00:25:26.720,00:25:28.910,到了午后还不知要什么样子呢,00:25:27.720,00:25:30.120,It will be intolerable by the afternoon.
00:25:29.400,00:25:30.270,小主最怕热,,,
00:25:30.520,00:25:31.790,等一下回去先沐浴更衣,00:25:30.340,00:25:31.600,"You cannot stand the heat, My Lady."
,,,00:25:31.600,00:25:33.140,You can bathe first thing when ...
00:25:36.080,00:25:37.140,华妃娘娘金安,00:25:37.020,00:25:38.560,Peace to Your Highness.
00:25:46.120,00:25:46.910,起来吧,00:25:47.040,00:25:48.200,Rise.
00:25:49.960,00:25:51.710,本宫有今日重定之时,00:25:50.840,00:25:52.660,Have you ever imagined ...
00:25:52.880,00:25:54.020,你可曾想到,00:25:53.700,00:25:55.540,the day I have my status restored?
00:25:56.160,00:25:57.380,娘娘后福无穷,00:25:57.180,00:25:58.960,Your Highness has unending blessings from Heaven.
00:25:58.040,00:25:59.990,岂是妹妹可以揣测预知的,00:25:59.020,00:26:01.080,I do not question the divine.
00:26:01.320,00:26:03.590,还未来得及恭贺娘娘重定之喜,00:26:02.280,00:26:04.820,"I haven't congratulated Your Highness
on your reinstatement."
00:26:04.360,00:26:05.270,在此贺过,00:26:05.360,00:26:06.540,I extend my congratulations.
00:26:05.600,00:26:09.670,免了 本宫可不敢当莞嫔此礼,00:26:06.640,00:26:07.800,No need.
,,,00:26:08.500,00:26:10.760,I do not merit your congratulations.
00:26:11.560,00:26:12.700,你越是恭顺,00:26:12.660,00:26:14.360,"The more obediently you behave,"
00:26:14.320,00:26:15.910,本宫就越是觉得可憎,00:26:15.340,00:26:16.960,the more detestable you are.
00:26:16.400,00:26:17.620,娘娘真是说笑了,00:26:17.320,00:26:19.040,Your highness is bantering.
00:26:18.440,00:26:19.830,难道娘娘是喜欢妹妹,00:26:19.400,00:26:21.220,Does Your Highness prefer me to be defiant
00:26:20.240,00:26:22.310,对娘娘不恭不顺 直言犯上吗,00:26:21.220,00:26:23.380,and speak disrespectfully to Your Highness?
00:26:24.040,00:26:25.910,妹妹并不敢肆意冒犯娘娘,00:26:25.060,00:26:27.080,I dare not offend Your Highness.
00:26:26.480,00:26:28.550,不敢冒犯也已经冒犯了,00:26:27.460,00:26:29.620,But you have already.
00:26:31.640,00:26:33.710,本宫绝不会忘了昔日之事,00:26:32.640,00:26:34.820,I will never forget what happened in the past.
00:26:34.880,00:26:36.310,娘娘教训得极是,00:26:35.840,00:26:37.760,I appreciate Your Highness's advice.
00:26:37.160,00:26:40.030,妹妹愿意时时聆听娘娘的教诲,00:26:38.080,00:26:41.260,"I am always willing to listen to
Your Highness's teachings."
00:26:41.680,00:26:43.230,你愿意时时聆听,00:26:42.640,00:26:44.500,You are always willing
00:26:44.080,00:26:46.640,本宫却不愿时时见你这副面孔,00:26:44.980,00:26:47.640,but I don’t want to often see your face.
00:26:48.680,00:26:49.990,娘娘莫要生气,,,
00:26:50.400,00:26:51.540,娘娘千金之体,00:26:49.740,00:26:51.360,"Your Highness, please don’t be angry."
00:26:51.840,00:26:54.350,若为一介小小宫嫔气伤了身体,00:26:51.360,00:26:52.960,Your Highness's precious health
00:26:54.720,00:26:56.030,倒不值许多呢,00:26:52.960,00:26:56.780,is not worth being harmed by a trivial concubine.
00:26:57.200,00:26:58.390,世间尊卑有道,,,
00:26:58.840,00:27:00.110,哪里有尊贵之身,00:26:58.240,00:26:59.720,Status and rank are the natural order.
00:27:00.560,00:27:02.990,为卑贱之身生气之缘故呢,00:26:59.740,00:27:03.880,Why should a noble person be angry with a humble person?
00:27:04.640,00:27:07.590,那岂不是太便宜了那些卑贱之人,00:27:05.640,00:27:08.540,Wouldn't that be an honor to the humble?
00:27:07.960,00:27:08.510,你,00:27:08.720,00:27:09.600,You ...
00:27:11.440,00:27:12.870,这不是新得皇上宠爱的,,,
00:27:13.160,00:27:14.140,颂芝妹妹吗,00:27:12.380,00:27:15.500,"Isn't this Song Zhi who has
newly gained favor from His Majesty?"
00:27:15.600,00:27:17.790,方才妹妹说的话实在是正理,00:27:16.580,00:27:18.780,What you just said is true.
00:27:18.640,00:27:20.110,世间尊卑有道,00:27:19.560,00:27:21.220,"""Status and rank are the natural order."""
00:27:21.040,00:27:22.630,妹妹这样振振有辞,00:27:21.920,00:27:23.720,You spoke with such confidence
00:27:23.480,00:27:27.390,屈居末流的答应实在是叫人惋惜,00:27:24.400,00:27:26.500,that it is a shame
,,,00:27:26.780,00:27:28.660,that you’re just a humble Companion.
00:27:28.680,00:27:30.950,本宫一定为妹妹向皇上进言,00:27:29.640,00:27:32.060,I must suggest to His Majesty
00:27:31.520,00:27:33.270,非至嫔位或者是贵人,00:27:32.520,00:27:34.680,that he grant you the rank of Concubine or Noble Lady
00:27:33.800,00:27:35.510,方能彰显妹妹的身份,00:27:34.880,00:27:36.860,to recognize your nobleness.
00:27:36.600,00:27:40.990,娘娘 皇上请了娘娘和咱们姐妹,00:27:37.620,00:27:38.880,"Your Highness,"
00:27:41.280,00:27:42.500,去玉镜鸣琴馆听戏,00:27:39.640,00:27:43.420,His Majesty invited us to the opera house.
00:27:42.960,00:27:45.070,听说还特地点了娘娘,00:27:43.960,00:27:45.020,I’ve heard that
00:27:45.400,00:27:47.510,您最爱听的娘子关呢,00:27:45.080,00:27:48.720,"His Majesty specially ordered Your Highness's
favorite play, The Niangzi Pass."
00:27:48.160,00:27:50.030,何苦在这大热天的,00:27:49.160,00:27:51.100,Why bother wasting time
00:27:50.600,00:27:52.270,与人多费口舌呢,00:27:51.520,00:27:53.680,under the scorching sun?
00:28:12.920,00:28:14.110,流朱 我们走,00:28:13.780,00:28:15.180,"Vermilion, let’s go."
00:28:19.440,00:28:21.630,奴婢见外头热了 小主还不回来,00:28:20.340,00:28:22.780,It was getting hot outside and you hadn’t come back.
00:28:21.960,00:28:23.180,正想派人去瞧瞧呢,00:28:22.840,00:28:24.620,I was about to send someone to look.
00:28:24.200,00:28:25.550,不过是在园子里逛逛,00:28:25.160,00:28:26.900,I was just walking around in the garden.
00:28:26.360,00:28:27.310,能出什么事,00:28:27.280,00:28:28.540,What can happen?
00:28:29.000,00:28:30.910,你可不知道 气死我了,00:28:29.800,00:28:31.940,"Jade, I was furious."
00:28:31.240,00:28:33.270,竟然碰上华妃和新得宠的芝答应,00:28:32.220,00:28:34.660,We ran into Consort Fleur and Companion Zhi.
00:28:33.840,00:28:35.390,害得小主受好大的委屈,,,
00:28:36.000,00:28:36.790,这话怎么说啊,00:28:35.000,00:28:36.620,My Lady suffered a great grievance.
00:28:37.600,00:28:39.150,小主现在很得皇上喜欢,00:28:36.940,00:28:38.260,What happened?
00:28:39.480,00:28:40.910,难道她们都不知道顾忌的吗,00:28:38.540,00:28:40.320,My Lady is in high favor right now.
00:28:41.280,00:28:43.070,华妃对小主是一向如此,00:28:40.440,00:28:42.260,How could they not be fearful of behaving rudely?
00:28:43.400,00:28:44.590,可恨的是那个芝答应,00:28:42.300,00:28:44.200,Consort Fleur always treats My Lady like that.
00:28:45.200,00:28:45.870,宫女出身,00:28:44.380,00:28:45.840,But Companion Zhi is intolerable!
00:28:46.320,00:28:47.830,还敢对小主句句带刺的,00:28:46.160,00:28:47.400,She was just a maid.
00:28:48.560,00:28:50.230,芝答应原是华妃身边的人,00:28:47.400,00:28:49.020,"How dare she ""speak with barbs""!"
00:28:50.720,00:28:52.390,自然仗着华妃为虎作怅了,00:28:49.520,00:28:51.360,She was Consort Fleur’s servant.
00:28:53.080,00:28:54.300,小主也太好性了,00:28:51.660,00:28:53.940,"Naturally, she has became a jackal relying on a tiger."
00:28:54.720,00:28:56.070,咱们不理会华妃也便罢了,00:28:54.080,00:28:55.800,"My Lady, you were being too kind."
00:28:56.480,00:28:57.830,难道还由着颂芝轻狂吗,00:28:55.800,00:28:57.420,"We can ignore Consort Fleur,"
00:28:58.520,00:28:59.470,要是依我的性子,00:28:57.420,00:28:59.320,but do we need to tolerate Song Zhi?
00:28:59.920,00:29:01.190,必定狠狠赏她几个耳光,00:28:59.560,00:29:00.840,"If I were you,"
00:29:01.520,00:29:02.190,再禀报皇上,00:29:00.840,00:29:03.340,I would slap her so sharply
00:29:02.560,00:29:03.670,让她去辛者库服苦役,00:29:03.420,00:29:05.620,and tell His Majesty to banish her to the slave caste.
00:29:05.240,00:29:07.750,你听听流朱的嘴 越发厉害了,00:29:06.120,00:29:07.540,Just listen to Vermillion -
,,,00:29:07.640,00:29:09.260,her tongue has become so unsparing.
00:29:09.400,00:29:11.350,眼见我手下就是她当家了,00:29:10.380,00:29:12.380,It seems that she is in charge of my palace.
00:29:12.080,00:29:13.550,你的性子也太急了,00:29:13.060,00:29:14.820,Your temper is too short.
00:29:14.640,00:29:16.430,光是急性子就能办成事吗,00:29:15.640,00:29:17.720,Can that accomplsh anything for me?
00:29:17.640,00:29:20.310,我叮嘱过你们 不要和华妃顶撞,00:29:18.640,00:29:19.980,I told you both:
00:29:20.680,00:29:21.820,如今再说一句,00:29:19.980,00:29:21.540,don't cause conflicts with Confort Fleur.
00:29:22.200,00:29:23.670,也不要和她身边的人顶撞,00:29:21.580,00:29:23.100,Now one more rule:
00:29:24.320,00:29:25.430,敷衍过去就行了,00:29:23.100,00:29:24.740,don't cause conflicts with her subjects.
00:29:25.800,00:29:26.710,还怕没有来日吗,00:29:25.260,00:29:26.440,Pay no attention to them.
00:29:26.960,00:29:29.710,那 那颂芝对小主这样轻慢,00:29:26.560,00:29:28.420,There is ample time ahead for us.
00:29:30.120,00:29:31.630,难道小主还要放过她吗,00:29:28.960,00:29:30.940,"But Song Zhi treated you so impertinently,"
00:29:31.840,00:29:32.590,浣碧 你说呢,00:29:31.040,00:29:32.700,"do you forgive her, My Lady?"
,,,00:29:32.720,00:29:34.120,"Jade, what do you think?"
00:29:34.080,00:29:37.110,奴婢想不如先忍了这一时,00:29:35.060,00:29:36.160,"My Lady,"
00:29:37.560,00:29:38.430,以求后报,00:29:36.740,00:29:38.500,I believe it's better to endure this momentarily
00:29:38.760,00:29:40.270,忍是一定要忍这一时的,00:29:38.600,00:29:39.780,for future revenge.
00:29:41.040,00:29:42.150,更何况我也不屑,00:29:39.820,00:29:41.800,Forbearance is a must at the moment.
00:29:42.440,00:29:43.550,对颂芝这样的人动手,00:29:41.940,00:29:44.540,"Besides, I disdain taking action against someone like Song Zhi."
00:29:44.920,00:29:45.900,忍着颂芝,00:29:45.800,00:29:47.100,Enduring her now
00:29:46.320,00:29:47.990,不代表对其他人没有作为,00:29:47.260,00:29:49.260,doesn't mean I will not act in the future.
00:29:49.160,00:29:51.190,颂芝之所以敢这样倡狂,00:29:50.060,00:29:52.200,Song Zhi dares to be so arrogant
00:29:51.520,00:29:52.830,是因为她背后有华妃,00:29:52.440,00:29:54.340,because she has Consort Fleur behind her.
00:29:53.800,00:29:55.790,你们以为凭她就有这样的能耐,00:29:54.760,00:29:56.820,Do you really think her capable of anything?
00:29:56.120,00:29:57.750,她不过一个区区小卒,00:29:56.940,00:29:58.680,She's just a small pawn.
00:29:58.640,00:29:59.830,小主的意思是,00:29:59.720,00:30:01.180,"My Lady, you mean…"
00:30:00.840,00:30:03.140,杜甫前出塞的第六首是怎么说的,00:30:01.740,00:30:05.160,"What is written in Du Fu’s
sixth poem in “Out of the Frontier”?"
00:30:06.080,00:30:08.380,射人先射马 擒贼,00:30:06.960,00:30:10.280,"""To capture an army, shoot their horses.

00:30:16.720,00:30:17.550,朕看了,00:30:17.600,00:30:18.940,I have read
00:30:18.760,00:30:22.670,这些折子都是弹勤年羹尧的,00:30:19.700,00:30:23.880,all these memorandums are to impeach Nian Gengyao.
00:30:23.560,00:30:25.750,朕也一一作了批示,00:30:24.420,00:30:26.900,I have marked and commented on each of them.
00:30:26.920,00:30:27.510,是,00:30:27.920,00:30:28.760,Yes.
00:30:28.080,00:30:29.830,奴才请皇上圣裁,00:30:28.900,00:30:31.040,I await Your Majesty's adjudication.
00:30:30.840,00:30:32.710,年羹尧做事骄横,00:30:31.880,00:30:34.000,Nian Gengyao acts arrogantly
00:30:33.760,00:30:35.990,下边的人自然有怨气,00:30:34.720,00:30:37.180,and naturally the other officials resent him.
00:30:37.600,00:30:39.790,朕 为皇上,00:30:38.620,00:30:39.560,I

00:30:44.160,00:30:48.150,自然要他们有话直说便好,00:30:45.140,00:30:46.780,"Naturally, I want them"
00:30:49.280,00:30:49.950,甄远道,00:30:47.500,00:30:49.300,to be able to speak freely.

00:30:55.080,00:30:58.150,你都要替朕让他们张开嘴来,00:30:55.680,00:30:58.840,make sure they open their mouths to you.
00:30:58.520,00:30:59.470,是 皇上,,,
00:30:59.920,00:31:00.750,前两日,00:30:59.420,00:31:00.680,"Yes, My Majesty."
,,,00:31:00.800,00:31:02.260,"Two days ago,"
00:31:01.880,00:31:04.550,朕问了年羹尧一件要紧事,00:31:02.880,00:31:05.560,I asked Nian Gengyao about something important.
00:31:06.000,00:31:06.790,自然了,00:31:07.140,00:31:08.020,"Of course,"
00:31:07.560,00:31:09.390,朕也想听听你们的意思,00:31:08.140,00:31:10.240,I also want to hear your opinions.
00:31:09.640,00:31:10.510,是,00:31:10.560,00:31:11.740,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:31:11.360,00:31:14.710,老八允禩和老九允禟,00:31:12.320,00:31:15.800,"Lord VIII Yunsi and Lord IX Yuntang
[the Emperor's brothers]"
00:31:15.240,00:31:17.870,被关在宗人府也有些日子了,00:31:15.940,00:31:18.900,have long been imprisioned in Imperial Clan Court.
00:31:18.640,00:31:21.830,朕听说他们不仅不安心思过,00:31:19.540,00:31:22.800,I've heard they not only didn't reflect on their faults
00:31:22.600,00:31:24.510,还辱骂朕与先帝,00:31:23.460,00:31:25.820,"but also cursed me, and the prior emperor."
00:31:25.840,00:31:29.070,你们以为朕该如何处置,00:31:26.860,00:31:29.860,What do you think I should do?
00:31:29.400,00:31:31.780,罪臣允禩 允禟结党妄行,00:31:30.120,00:31:33.280,"The guilty officials Yunsi and Yuntang
formed a faction and acted unlawfully."
00:31:32.560,00:31:33.910,他们若不思悔改,00:31:33.540,00:31:35.300,"If they refuse to be repentant,"
00:31:34.360,00:31:36.710,便是自作孽 不可活,00:31:35.340,00:31:37.940,that is an unforgivable crime.
00:31:39.120,00:31:40.260,舅舅以为如何,00:31:40.100,00:31:41.980,"Uncle, what do you think?"
00:31:41.720,00:31:44.510,奴才以为允禩与允禟虽然有罪,00:31:42.600,00:31:45.760,"Your Majesty, although Yunsi and Yuntang are guilty,"
00:31:44.880,00:31:47.790,但终究是皇上手足,00:31:45.960,00:31:47.900,"they are, after all,"
,,,00:31:47.920,00:31:49.440,Your Majesty's brothers.
00:31:48.480,00:31:51.910,不如请族中的尊长到宗人府,00:31:49.440,00:31:53.920,"What about sending respected senior members of
the clan to enlighten them in Imperial Clan Court?"
00:31:52.280,00:31:53.150,教导二人,,,
00:31:54.760,00:31:55.740,甄远道,00:31:55.700,00:31:56.860,Zhen Yuandao.
00:31:56.040,00:31:59.430,微臣以为 若只以为是兄弟,00:31:56.900,00:32:00.520,"Your Majesty, if they dare to ignore
the relations of monarch and subject"
00:31:59.720,00:32:01.990,便可以同顾君臣人伦,00:32:00.680,00:32:03.220,"as Your Majesty's brothers,"
00:32:02.320,00:32:05.070,或者他们不行兄弟之义在先,00:32:03.340,00:32:06.440,or if they formerly failed to fulfil the duties between brothers
00:32:05.480,00:32:08.150,而不知悔过改错于后,00:32:06.460,00:32:09.160,"and refuse to repent and amend their faults,"
00:32:08.960,00:32:12.580,那皇上就无须法外施恩了,00:32:09.980,00:32:13.680,then Your Majesty need not grant any favors beyond the laws.
00:32:20.280,00:32:22.840,三位爱卿说得都有理,00:32:21.300,00:32:24.260,All your comments are reasoned.
00:32:25.040,00:32:26.430,朕再斟酌,00:32:26.080,00:32:27.780,I will think it over.
00:32:30.840,00:32:31.820,皇上问及哥哥,,,
00:32:32.160,00:32:33.710,该如何处置允禩与允禟,00:32:31.720,00:32:34.860,"His Majesty asked my brother
what to do about Yunsi and Yuntang."
00:32:34.840,00:32:35.710,你怎么看,00:32:35.700,00:32:36.980,What do you think?
00:32:36.360,00:32:38.390,大将军近日屡受弹勤,00:32:37.380,00:32:39.620,"The great general has been repeatedly impugned recently,"
00:32:38.760,00:32:39.710,而皇上却,00:32:39.680,00:32:40.980,and His Majesty ...
00:32:41.120,00:32:42.590,却褒奖弹勤之人,00:32:42.120,00:32:44.180,expressed approval of the accusers.
00:32:43.440,00:32:46.190,恐怕大将军正为此事郁郁不安,00:32:44.440,00:32:47.200,"I'm afraid the general might be uneasy about this,"
00:32:46.560,00:32:49.310,唯恐应答不当又见罪于皇上,00:32:47.460,00:32:50.400,"and fearful of offending His Majesty
with an improper response."
00:32:51.840,00:32:53.470,所以在这个节骨眼上,00:32:52.960,00:32:54.700,"So at this juncture,"
00:32:54.080,00:32:55.990,就更不能随便回答皇上了,00:32:54.920,00:32:56.900,he must be careful how he answers His Majesty.
00:32:56.200,00:32:56.830,是,,,
00:32:57.320,00:32:58.110,若是说,00:32:57.100,00:32:58.020,Yes.
,,,00:32:58.280,00:32:59.260,If His Majesty
00:32:58.520,00:33:01.110,对允禩与允禟两兄弟不留情面,00:32:59.500,00:33:02.340,"shows no mercy towards
his brothers Yunsi and Yuntang,"
00:33:02.920,00:33:04.990,来日若是哥哥也遭人污蔑,00:33:03.940,00:33:06.660,what would happen if my brother was slandered in the future?
00:33:06.440,00:33:08.390,皇上岂不是要赶尽杀绝,00:33:07.600,00:33:09.540,Would His Majesty be even more ruthless?
00:33:09.200,00:33:10.470,娘娘实在多虑了,00:33:10.160,00:33:11.840,Your Highness is having unnecessary concerns.
00:33:10.840,00:33:13.190,皇上怎会如此对大将军呢,00:33:11.880,00:33:14.580,Why would His Majesty do this to the great general?
00:33:15.240,00:33:18.230,这些日子弹勤哥哥的人多,00:33:16.280,00:33:19.380,There have been so many people speaking against my brother lately.
00:33:19.040,00:33:20.230,就连哥哥身边的人,,,
00:33:20.760,00:33:22.590,也都出现了忘恩负义之徒,00:33:19.980,00:33:21.700,Even among the people surrounding my brother -
00:33:23.520,00:33:24.910,皇上在这种时候,00:33:22.040,00:33:23.680,some ingrates have appeared.
00:33:25.240,00:33:26.830,要哥哥回答这样的问题,00:33:24.440,00:33:28.020,"His Majesty asked my brother
such a question in this situation ..."
00:33:28.920,00:33:30.310,究竟是什么意思,00:33:29.920,00:33:31.860,What does he really mean?
00:33:31.360,00:33:32.030,也许,00:33:32.460,00:33:33.660,Perhaps...
00:33:33.280,00:33:35.840,也许皇上只是随口一问罢了,00:33:34.140,00:33:36.920,"Perhaps His Majesty just asked casually, that's all."
00:33:36.200,00:33:39.790,不会 皇上不会这样,00:33:37.240,00:33:38.240,No chance.
00:33:40.680,00:33:42.150,皇上一直倚重哥哥,00:33:39.400,00:33:41.080,His Majesty is never like that.
,,,00:33:41.720,00:33:43.660,His Majesty always thought highly of my brother.
00:33:43.120,00:33:44.830,今日却有冷落之心,00:33:44.040,00:33:46.200,"But now, begins to doubt my brother."
00:33:47.520,00:33:49.470,年家一直对皇上忠心耿耿,00:33:48.500,00:33:50.760,The Nians are always loyal and devoted to His Majesty.
00:33:50.000,00:33:50.470,是,,,
00:33:50.720,00:33:52.390,皇上一定是被谣言迷惑,00:33:50.940,00:33:51.660,Yes.
,,,00:33:51.660,00:33:53.620,His Majesty must be confused by the rumors.
00:33:53.720,00:33:56.470,皇上并非不念旧情之人,00:33:54.620,00:33:57.480,"His Majesty is not a person who
feels no affection for the past."
00:33:56.960,00:33:58.910,娘娘若是觉得唇亡齿寒,00:33:57.620,00:34:00.260,"If Your Highness is afraid that
""teeth will feel cold when the lips are gone"","
00:33:59.280,00:34:00.190,大可请大将军,00:34:00.260,00:34:01.520,Your Highness could ask the great general
00:34:00.560,00:34:03.350,在皇上面前多提礼仪孝道之义,00:34:01.560,00:34:04.420,"to talk more about etiquette and filial piety
in front of His Majesty"
00:34:03.680,00:34:05.390,以期以情打动皇上,00:34:04.580,00:34:06.700,in order to appeal to His Majesty emotionally.
00:34:05.920,00:34:06.950,皇上顾此及彼,00:34:06.940,00:34:08.340,This will remind His Majesty
00:34:07.400,00:34:09.350,必会感念大将军忠心,00:34:08.440,00:34:10.360,of the great general's loyalty
00:34:09.600,00:34:11.950,想起大将军立下的汗马功劳,00:34:10.520,00:34:12.940,and create gratitude for his military merits.
00:34:14.160,00:34:15.070,可是允禩与允禟,,,
00:34:15.400,00:34:16.870,曾与皇上争夺皇位,00:34:15.120,00:34:18.060,"But Yunsi and Yuntang fought against
His Majesty for the throne"
00:34:17.600,00:34:18.910,又意图动摇天下,00:34:18.520,00:34:20.800,and intended to destabilize His Majesty's authority.
00:34:20.600,00:34:23.750,是皇上最厌弃痛恶之人,00:34:21.580,00:34:22.780,They are
,,,00:34:23.180,00:34:25.240,the ones His Majesty hates and detests the most.
00:34:26.520,00:34:27.630,这样回答可以吗,00:34:27.520,00:34:29.340,Is it all right to reply this way?
00:34:29.680,00:34:31.670,自然不可让大将军,00:34:30.740,00:34:31.760,"Of course,"
00:34:32.040,00:34:33.870,劝皇上释放允禩与允禟,00:34:31.800,00:34:35.020,"the great general should not advise
His Majesty to release Yunsi and Yuntang."
00:34:34.960,00:34:37.070,可是不妨,00:34:35.820,00:34:36.880,"However,"
00:34:37.280,00:34:39.390,多提提往日君臣手足之情,00:34:37.040,00:34:40.760,"there is no harm in mentioning their
decades of devotion as brothers."
00:34:39.920,00:34:43.190,同时略施一笔 以表忠心,00:34:40.960,00:34:44.220,"And at the same time, asserting his own loyalty to His Majesty."
00:34:43.920,00:34:46.710,想来这样也就无妨了,00:34:44.940,00:34:47.660,I believe such a reply would be fine.
00:34:54.080,00:34:56.460,这也不失为一个折中的方法,00:34:55.040,00:34:57.380,This is not a bad concession.
00:34:58.640,00:35:00.790,皇上心软念旧,00:34:59.720,00:35:02.100,His Majesty is soft-hearted and affectionate towards the past
00:35:01.360,00:35:02.580,待娘娘是这样,00:35:02.280,00:35:04.100,"with Your Highness,"
00:35:03.240,00:35:05.800,待大将军更是这样了,00:35:04.180,00:35:06.940,and even more so with the great general.
00:35:29.840,00:35:31.510,你倒是逍遥自在,00:35:30.680,00:35:33.020,You are the most carefree in the palace.
00:35:32.840,00:35:33.670,皇上万福,00:35:33.920,00:35:35.460,Grace to Your Majesty.
00:35:41.160,00:35:43.720,臣妾也是无事可忙 躲懒罢了,00:35:42.100,00:35:44.920,I have nothing to do. I'm just being lazy.
00:35:44.200,00:35:45.710,皇上是从勤政殿过来吗,00:35:45.160,00:35:47.100,Did His Majesty come from the Governance Hall?
00:35:48.000,00:35:49.510,华妃刚才来见朕,00:35:49.000,00:35:50.900,Consort Fleur just came to me.
00:35:50.880,00:35:52.150,是为年将军的事吗,00:35:51.820,00:35:53.720,To speak for General Nian?
00:35:54.280,00:35:55.110,是为你,00:35:55.240,00:35:56.920,She came to speak about you.
00:35:57.440,00:36:00.470,当然 朕知道你已经尽力容忍了,00:35:58.480,00:36:01.620,"Of course, I know you have done your best to tolerate it."
00:36:02.480,00:36:04.670,皇上是不会相信的 是吗,00:36:03.440,00:36:05.980,"Your Majesty won't believe in what she said, right?"
00:36:06.880,00:36:10.910,是 华妃跟朕说你对她不敬,00:36:07.740,00:36:08.980,I won't.
,,,00:36:10.180,00:36:12.060,Consort Fleur told me that you were disrespectful to her.
00:36:11.320,00:36:13.780,还带了芝答应哭哭啼啼不休,00:36:12.260,00:36:15.160,"She also brought Companion Zhi
who was crying endlessly."
00:36:14.520,00:36:17.670,她生性要强 不达目的决不罢休,00:36:15.480,00:36:19.120,"It's her nature to be strong-willed and
she never stops until she reaches her goal."
00:36:19.440,00:36:20.750,那皇上如何打算呢,00:36:20.320,00:36:22.520,What does Your Majesty intend to do about it?
00:36:35.440,00:36:38.710,朕走这步棋也是不得已,00:36:36.500,00:36:39.860,I have to make this move against my will.
00:36:40.280,00:36:42.190,朕不想你听到这些烦心事,,,
00:36:42.520,00:36:43.390,为朕担忧,00:36:41.180,00:36:44.580,"I don't want you to hear these
disturbing things and worry about me."
00:36:44.160,00:36:47.780,朕只告诉你 年羹尧越来越放肆,00:36:45.080,00:36:46.840,I tell you only that
00:36:48.120,00:36:50.070,朕是实在不能再忍了,00:36:47.180,00:36:49.700,Nian Gengyao is getting more and more presumptuous.
,,,00:36:50.160,00:36:51.880,I have no more tolerance for it.
00:36:52.600,00:36:55.060,皇上是天子 无所不能真,00:36:53.480,00:36:56.480,"Your Majesty is the Son of Heaven.
You're capable of doing anything."
00:36:56.000,00:36:57.710,既然刀子搁在心头久了,,,
00:36:58.240,00:36:59.220,也是该拔除了,00:36:57.000,00:36:59.180,"Since the knife has been in your heart for a long time,"
00:37:00.080,00:37:01.470,朕忍到这一刻,00:36:59.180,00:37:00.680,it's time to remove it.
00:37:01.800,00:37:03.790,就是为了拔除的时候更利索些,00:37:01.100,00:37:04.720,"I have refrained until this moment
in order to remove it smoothly."
00:37:04.360,00:37:06.470,要是换成你 你会这么做吗,00:37:05.280,00:37:07.620,"If you were me, would you do the same?"
00:37:07.920,00:37:08.670,臣妾明白,00:37:08.920,00:37:11.020,"Yes, I understand Your Majesty."
00:37:11.360,00:37:12.030,好,00:37:12.180,00:37:13.360,Good.
00:37:12.960,00:37:15.550,时辰尚早 朕回去看折子,00:37:13.840,00:37:16.700,"It's still early, I'll go back to read the memorandum."
00:37:16.240,00:37:17.070,你先休息,00:37:17.140,00:37:18.640,You can have some rest.
00:37:21.240,00:37:22.590,臣妾恭送皇上,00:37:22.040,00:37:23.800,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:37:26.640,00:37:29.350,明日朕在九州清晏设宴,00:37:27.460,00:37:28.420,"Tomorrow,"
00:37:30.040,00:37:31.150,你早点过去,00:37:28.580,00:37:30.680,I will host a banquet in Jiuzhou Qingyan.
00:37:31.320,00:37:31.950,是,00:37:30.960,00:37:32.060,Go there early.
00:37:37.480,00:37:38.150,回禀娘娘,00:37:32.300,00:37:33.320,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:37:38.640,00:37:39.270,皇上今儿晚上,00:37:38.440,00:37:39.560,"Your Highness,"
00:37:39.600,00:37:40.710,翻的又是芝答应的牌子,00:37:39.640,00:37:42.200,"tonight, His Majesty selected
the name tag of Companion Zhi again."
00:37:42.520,00:37:43.150,你下去吧,,,
00:37:43.640,00:37:44.230,嗻,00:37:43.400,00:37:44.580,You can go now.
,,,00:37:44.580,00:37:45.700,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:37:46.040,00:37:47.020,两位姐姐听听,00:37:45.940,00:37:48.100,Did you hear that?
00:37:47.720,00:37:49.270,皇上又召幸了芝答应,00:37:48.660,00:37:50.640,His Majesty is favoring Companion Zhi again.
00:37:49.680,00:37:51.350,这几日哪天不是这样,00:37:50.640,00:37:53.020,Has it been any different in the past few days?
00:37:52.200,00:37:55.150,皇上有了新宠 正在兴头上呢,00:37:53.280,00:37:56.460,"His Majesty has a new favorite.
He is only in the mood for her."
00:37:55.960,00:37:57.020,凭她什么新宠,00:37:56.860,00:37:58.780,What kind of a new favorite is she?
00:37:58.040,00:37:59.630,昨日还是低贱的奴婢,00:37:58.980,00:38:00.760,"She was just a humble servant before,"
00:37:59.920,00:38:02.070,今日就爬上了皇上的龙床,00:38:00.800,00:38:03.080,but now she's climbed into the dragon's bed.
00:38:02.360,00:38:03.270,本宫还嫌她,00:38:03.240,00:38:04.280,It disgusts me
00:38:03.600,00:38:05.230,脏了九州清晏的床铺呢,00:38:04.460,00:38:06.780,when I think about how she soils His Majesty's bed.
00:38:06.040,00:38:07.750,莞妹妹心直口快,00:38:07.000,00:38:08.760,"Sourire, you're being frank and outspoken."
00:38:08.200,00:38:10.500,这话可不敢往外说,00:38:09.080,00:38:11.320,I wouldn't dare to say this out loud.
00:38:10.760,00:38:13.030,这是实话 本宫既然敢说,00:38:11.540,00:38:13.120,I'm speaking the truth.
00:38:13.440,00:38:14.580,就不怕有人往外传,00:38:13.120,00:38:15.940,"Since I dare to say it,
I'm not afraid of anyone spreading it."
00:38:16.440,00:38:18.630,哪日非得叫这位新宠失了恩宠,00:38:17.320,00:38:19.880,"Someday I will turn this ""newly favored"" to ""out of favor""."
00:38:19.240,00:38:20.300,她才知道厉害,00:38:20.220,00:38:21.980,Then she will learn her lesson.
00:38:29.440,00:38:30.150,皇上,00:38:30.400,00:38:31.640,"Your Majesty,"
00:38:30.960,00:38:33.670,听说您最近不喜欢年大将军,00:38:31.820,00:38:34.720,"I heard that you don’t like Great General Nian recently,"
00:38:34.080,00:38:35.870,总是批折子责骂他呢,00:38:34.920,00:38:37.240,and have criticized his memorandums.
00:38:37.960,00:38:39.790,谁和你说的这些话,00:38:38.980,00:38:40.900,Who told you this?
00:38:40.440,00:38:42.030,臣妾不敢乱听乱说,00:38:41.400,00:38:43.360,I dare not listen to any gossip.
00:38:42.720,00:38:45.350,只是臣妾跟在华妃娘娘身边,00:38:43.660,00:38:46.500,It's just because I live with Consort Fleur
00:38:45.720,00:38:47.230,总是听到一些议论,00:38:46.660,00:38:48.600,and always hear such talk.
00:38:48.360,00:38:49.340,她们议论什么,00:38:49.300,00:38:50.840,What are they talking about?
00:38:50.360,00:38:54.470,说朕刻薄寡恩 贬斥功臣吗,00:38:51.240,00:38:55.520,"Do they say I'm unfaithful in my favors,
to rebuke a meritorious official?"
00:38:54.880,00:38:55.830,自然不是了,00:38:55.880,00:38:57.200,Of course not.
00:38:56.240,00:38:58.540,总说年大将军行为不检点,00:38:57.280,00:38:59.640,"They say that Great General Nian's conduct is improper,"
00:38:59.120,00:39:00.510,惹皇上生气了,00:38:59.940,00:39:01.480,which upsets Your Majesty.
00:39:00.760,00:39:04.300,朕生气 是因为朕看重年羹尧,00:39:01.600,00:39:05.800,I am angry because I think highly of Nian Gengyao.
00:39:05.360,00:39:07.550,希望他事事为朕做好,00:39:06.320,00:39:08.540,"I expect him to do everything well,"
00:39:07.880,00:39:10.790,不要落人话柄 也免得朕为难,00:39:08.820,00:39:11.780,"and not give others a reason to talk
and cause trouble for me."
00:39:11.960,00:39:14.190,原来皇上是心疼大将军,00:39:12.880,00:39:15.400,So it's because Your Majesty cherishes the great general.
00:39:15.360,00:39:17.950,朕是心疼华妃和你,00:39:16.340,00:39:19.020,I cherish Consort Fleur and you.
00:39:19.240,00:39:21.030,年羹尧对社稷有功,00:39:20.160,00:39:22.360,Nian Gengyao contributed to the state.
00:39:21.960,00:39:23.310,又是朕的大舅子,00:39:22.840,00:39:24.680,And he's also my brother-in-law.
00:39:24.800,00:39:26.910,华妃侍奉朕多年,00:39:25.840,00:39:28.380,"Consort Fleur has served me for years,"
00:39:28.040,00:39:30.870,又调教出你乖巧可爱,00:39:28.900,00:39:31.820,and she guides you to be sweet and well-behaved.
00:39:32.120,00:39:33.510,朕心里有数,00:39:33.180,00:39:35.020,I hold it dearly in my heart.
00:39:36.240,00:39:37.220,皇上,00:39:37.360,00:39:38.700,Your Majesty.
00:39:43.760,00:39:44.950,哥哥按本宫的意思,,,
00:39:45.320,00:39:46.350,递了折子给皇上,00:39:44.740,00:39:47.640,"My brother handed in a memorandum
following my suggestion."
00:39:46.760,00:39:48.070,皇上什么话都没说,00:39:47.760,00:39:49.300,His Majesty didn't say anything.
00:39:49.440,00:39:51.550,近日倒是停了对哥哥的训示,00:39:50.440,00:39:52.880,But His Majesty has stopped reprimanding my brother.
00:39:51.960,00:39:54.630,那就好了 嫔妾也能放心了,00:39:52.980,00:39:55.680,"That's good. I feel relieved, too."
00:39:55.920,00:39:57.390,你是不知道啊,,,
00:39:57.760,00:39:58.980,本宫每日都知道,00:39:56.900,00:39:58.500,You have no idea.
00:39:59.240,00:40:01.350,皇上在折子上是如何训示哥哥的,00:39:58.780,00:40:02.280,"I heard every day how His Majesty
reprimanded my brother in his memorandums."
00:40:01.680,00:40:03.710,这心里真是一万个心惊胆战,00:40:02.620,00:40:04.980,It sent thousands of shivers through my heart.
00:40:04.960,00:40:08.310,幸好前些日子颂芝侍奉皇上,00:40:05.880,00:40:09.440,"Fortunately, Song Zhi has been serving His Majesty."
00:40:08.880,00:40:11.470,从皇上的口气里听出,00:40:09.900,00:40:11.600,"From His Majesty's tone,"
,,,00:40:11.800,00:40:13.140,she sounded out that
00:40:12.240,00:40:14.990,皇上还是觉得哥哥有大功于社稷,00:40:13.260,00:40:16.240,"His Majesty still recognizes my brother's
great contributions to the nation."
00:40:15.560,00:40:16.230,是,00:40:16.480,00:40:17.460,Yes.
00:40:16.560,00:40:18.270,本宫也可以放心了,00:40:17.480,00:40:19.320,I can finally feel relieved.
00:40:19.480,00:40:20.950,皇上训示大将军,00:40:20.600,00:40:22.420,His Majesty reprimanded the great general
00:40:21.480,00:40:23.860,不过是那些无事生非的小人多了,00:40:22.480,00:40:24.880,"only because of the base persons
seeking trouble from nothing."
00:40:24.200,00:40:25.110,要做做样子罢了,00:40:24.880,00:40:26.580,His Majesty had to make a gesture.
00:40:25.920,00:40:28.480,又怎么会真心地斥责大将军呢,00:40:26.920,00:40:29.820,How can His  Majesty really reprimand the great general?
00:40:30.880,00:40:32.510,你的法子还算管用,00:40:31.940,00:40:33.980,Your method worked fairly well.
00:40:33.480,00:40:35.030,只要皇上见过奏折,00:40:34.440,00:40:36.260,As long as His Majesty sees the memorandum
00:40:35.520,00:40:37.030,能对娘娘更加眷顾,00:40:36.500,00:40:38.240,"and favors Your Highness more,"
00:40:37.480,00:40:39.350,嫔妾也就安心了,00:40:38.420,00:40:40.380,my mind will be at peace.
00:40:39.680,00:40:40.590,算你有心,00:40:40.500,00:40:42.000,You are very conscientious.
00:40:41.320,00:40:44.070,只要皇上对本宫和哥哥宠爱如初,00:40:42.340,00:40:45.180,"As long as His Majesty favors me and my brother as before,"
00:40:44.720,00:40:46.430,本宫自然不会亏待你,00:40:45.600,00:40:47.520,I won't treat you unfavorably.
00:40:47.720,00:40:49.630,待到温宜成人之日,00:40:48.680,00:40:50.880,"On the day when Wenyi comes of age,"
00:40:50.480,00:40:53.750,本宫会让皇上封你一个嫔位的,00:40:51.480,00:40:54.680,I will ask His Majesty to grant you the title of Concubine.
00:40:57.520,00:41:00.030,娘娘 芝答应侍寝回来了,00:40:58.520,00:41:01.180,"Your Highness, Companion Zhi has come back."
00:41:00.760,00:41:03.220,她想给娘娘请安,00:41:01.860,00:41:04.680,She wishes to pay her respects to Your Highness.
00:41:04.200,00:41:06.910,罢了 让她先歇着去吧,00:41:05.180,00:41:06.480,It's all right.
00:41:07.400,00:41:08.030,嗻,00:41:06.820,00:41:08.320,Let her take a rest first.
00:41:08.320,00:41:09.030,等等,00:41:08.320,00:41:09.380,"Yes, Your Highness."
,,,00:41:09.380,00:41:10.420,Wait.
00:41:12.960,00:41:15.260,别忘了把本宫的参汤赏给她喝,00:41:13.980,00:41:16.420,Don’t forget to reward her the ginseng soup.
00:41:17.680,00:41:18.550,嗻,00:41:18.580,00:41:20.040,"Y..Yes, Your Highness."
00:41:22.560,00:41:25.270,昨儿个又是芝答应侍寝呢,00:41:23.380,00:41:26.280,Companion Zhi served His Majesty again last night.
00:41:25.760,00:41:27.110,可见有娘娘调教,00:41:26.680,00:41:28.300,"With Your Highness's guidance,"
00:41:27.480,00:41:30.190,芝答应果然颇受恩宠啊,00:41:28.440,00:41:31.300,"Companion Zhi has certainly
gained high favor with His Majesty."
00:41:30.480,00:41:32.230,这也是她自己的造化,00:41:31.440,00:41:33.340,This is also her own good fortune.
00:41:33.040,00:41:34.590,本宫一样调教你,00:41:34.120,00:41:35.900,"You have my guidance just the same,"
00:41:35.160,00:41:36.510,你倒不如她得宠,00:41:36.100,00:41:38.160,yet you are not favored as she is.
00:41:39.080,00:41:41.350,不过这几日,00:41:40.120,00:41:42.420,"These few days, however,"
00:41:41.760,00:41:44.030,嫔妾的耳朵里刮过几阵风,00:41:42.760,00:41:45.120,a few gusts of wind blew into my ears.
00:41:45.000,00:41:46.110,听说莞嫔,,,
00:41:46.520,00:41:49.750,对芝答应受宠很是不满呢,00:41:45.940,00:41:50.820,"I heard that Concubine Souire is very dissatisfied with
Companion Zhi's new-found favor."
00:41:50.600,00:41:51.190,这些话,,,
00:41:51.520,00:41:53.510,本宫在皇上那儿倒是听了一些,00:41:51.420,00:41:54.380,I've also heard a bit about this from His Majesty.
00:41:54.480,00:41:57.190,难怪皇上今日怎么都不见她,00:41:55.420,00:41:58.020,No wonder His Majesty hasn't visited her recently.
00:41:58.120,00:41:59.310,原来是因为这个,00:41:59.040,00:42:00.540,Now I understand why.
00:41:59.800,00:42:02.390,皇上啊 正在兴头上,00:42:00.740,00:42:03.780,His Majesty desires only Song Zhi.
00:42:03.040,00:42:04.550,怎么会愿意听莞嫔,,,
00:42:04.840,00:42:06.590,这些吃醋的酸话呢,00:42:03.960,00:42:07.720,"Why would His Majesty want to hear
Concubine Souire's words soured with jealousy?"
00:42:07.840,00:42:08.750,好了,00:42:08.960,00:42:10.160,All right.
00:42:12.360,00:42:13.870,她若觉得酸,00:42:13.480,00:42:14.960,"If she has been feeling sour,"
00:42:15.480,00:42:19.070,本宫就让她酸个够,00:42:16.500,00:42:17.760,I will
,,,00:42:18.540,00:42:20.360,turn her favor sour to match.
