00:02:29.310,00:02:30.100,皇后也在,00:02:30.410,00:02:31.531,I see the Empress is also here.
00:02:32.940,00:02:33.770,皇上吉祥,,,
00:02:33.900,00:02:34.480,起来吧,00:02:34.040,00:02:35.000,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:02:35.440,00:02:36.020,是,00:02:35.000,00:02:35.787,Please rise.
,,,00:02:36.540,00:02:37.368,Yes.
00:02:36.740,00:02:38.400,儿子给皇额娘请安,00:02:37.840,00:02:39.500,Peace to Imperial Mother.
00:02:38.950,00:02:41.110,皇额娘的身子今日可好些了吗,00:02:40.050,00:02:42.210,"Are you feeling better today, Imperial Mother?"
00:02:42.120,00:02:42.980,好些了,00:02:43.220,00:02:44.328,I am.
00:02:43.740,00:02:46.400,地气湿冷 快起来 坐,00:02:44.840,00:02:47.500,"The earth qi is cold.
Rise and have a seat."
00:02:51.170,00:02:54.160,叫你来是要嘱咐你一件事,00:02:52.270,00:02:55.260,I asked you to come because I have a request.
00:02:54.750,00:02:56.490,儿子敬听皇额娘盼咐,00:02:55.850,00:02:57.673,"I obey your order, Imperial Mother."
00:02:57.300,00:02:58.880,听说莞嫔有孕,,,
00:02:59.470,00:03:01.170,皇帝碍于天象之说,00:02:58.400,00:03:00.228,"I heard that Concubine Sourire is pregnant,"
00:03:01.640,00:03:02.880,不敢接她回宫,00:03:00.570,00:03:03.960,but you hesitate to bring her back due to the astrological signs.
00:03:03.800,00:03:05.390,此事干系后宫,00:03:04.900,00:03:06.560,"This matter concerns the harem,"
00:03:05.720,00:03:07.340,儿子不敢妄自定夺,00:03:06.820,00:03:08.440,so I can't make a decision on my own.
00:03:08.020,00:03:10.100,更担心皇额娘的安康,00:03:09.120,00:03:11.532,"Also, the Astrological Office said this
might endanger your well-being."
00:03:11.350,00:03:14.270,皇额娘年纪大了身子不好,00:03:12.450,00:03:15.370,I'm advanced in age. My health is declining.
00:03:14.730,00:03:17.390,有什么事比你的皇嗣更重要呢,00:03:15.830,00:03:18.490,But what is more important than your heirs?
00:03:20.360,00:03:22.190,皇后 你说是吗,00:03:21.460,00:03:23.290,"Do you agree, Empress?"
00:03:23.320,00:03:23.940,是,00:03:24.420,00:03:25.280,Yes.
00:03:25.530,00:03:26.570,哀家觉得,00:03:26.630,00:03:28.089,I don't think
00:03:27.540,00:03:29.950,危月燕冲月不是要紧事,00:03:28.420,00:03:31.371,the astrological sign of the Roof mansion is important.
00:03:30.660,00:03:33.780,哀家和皇后福泽深厚自然不怕,00:03:31.760,00:03:34.880,"The Empress and I have Heaven's great blessings
and we are not afraid."
00:03:34.880,00:03:36.620,可是皇帝你知道吗,00:03:35.980,00:03:38.033,"But Emperor, have you been informed"
00:03:37.340,00:03:39.920,四阿哥差点被人毒害,00:03:38.281,00:03:41.248,that the Fourth Prince was almost poisoned last night?
00:03:40.880,00:03:42.620,吓得他一直不敢回宫,00:03:41.980,00:03:44.217,"He is too scared to return to his residence,"
00:03:43.340,00:03:46.260,只能住在哀家宫里 由哀家看护,00:03:44.440,00:03:47.360,and I let him stay in my palace to watch over him.
00:03:48.520,00:03:51.800,若是莞嫔的孩子再有什么差错,00:03:49.620,00:03:52.900,"If anything happens to Concubine Sourire's child,"
00:03:53.520,00:03:55.680,哀家和皇帝容不得她,00:03:54.620,00:03:57.208,you and I must no longer tolerate the offender.
00:03:57.900,00:04:00.690,那儿子想即刻迎莞嫔回宫,00:03:59.000,00:04:01.997,Then I'd like to bring Concubine Sourire back right away.
00:04:01.450,00:04:02.980,甄氏真是好福气呀,,,
00:04:03.450,00:04:05.810,皇上去过一次她便有了,00:04:02.550,00:04:06.880,"Zhen is very blessed, becoming pregnant
from Your Majesty's first visit."
00:04:06.120,00:04:08.530,恐怕要羡煞宫里很多姐妹了,00:04:07.220,00:04:09.754,Her sisters in the palace will feel envious.
00:04:09.200,00:04:12.690,只是那时甄氏被废去妃位,,,
00:04:12.960,00:04:14.570,按理说是等同废妃,00:04:10.300,00:04:16.025,"Moreover, Zhen was deprived of her title of Consort
and was considered banished."
00:04:15.040,00:04:17.120,这些宫里上下无人不知,00:04:16.025,00:04:18.356,This is known by everyone in the palace.
00:04:17.710,00:04:20.920,且祖制并无废妃重回后宫之例,00:04:18.810,00:04:22.268,"There is no precedent for a banished
 concubine to return to the palace."
00:04:21.550,00:04:24.630,位分可废便可封,00:04:22.650,00:04:25.730,Titles can be conferred as well as banished.
00:04:25.510,00:04:29.340,如此朕重新册封予她便是,00:04:26.610,00:04:30.440,"If that is the concern, I will grant her a new title."
00:04:30.350,00:04:31.550,如此大的动静,,,
00:04:31.810,00:04:33.890,只怕外头言官议论,00:04:31.450,00:04:34.960,I'm afraid the civil officials will be critical of such a big change.
00:04:35.310,00:04:39.100,皇额娘莞嫔怀的是皇家子嗣,00:04:36.410,00:04:40.200,"Imperial Mother, Concubine Sourire is bearing an imperial heir."
00:04:39.730,00:04:42.320,总不能让她在荒山野地里晾着,00:04:40.830,00:04:43.632,"We can't leave her ""hanging like laundry"" in the mountains."
00:04:42.860,00:04:45.350,理应接回宫静养才是,00:04:43.963,00:04:46.771,She should be brought back for a peaceful pregnancy.
00:04:48.030,00:04:50.450,如何迎回何时迎回,00:04:49.130,00:04:51.806,You are the emperor.
00:04:51.330,00:04:53.910,你是皇帝你做主便是了,00:04:52.179,00:04:55.373,You decide when and how she will return.
00:04:55.500,00:04:57.290,只是哀家自知病重,00:04:56.600,00:04:59.042,My current concern is the Fourth Prince;
00:04:58.420,00:05:00.280,不能照顾四阿哥太久,00:04:59.456,00:05:01.774,I'm too ill to take care of him for long.
00:05:02.010,00:05:05.370,希望皇帝替他安排一位养母,00:05:03.110,00:05:06.470,I hope you can arrange a foster mother for him.
00:05:06.680,00:05:08.840,别让这孩子孤苦无依,,,
00:05:09.220,00:05:10.260,如惊弓之鸟,00:05:07.780,00:05:11.650,"If left on his own, he will be like
""a bird trembling over the bow twangs."""
00:05:10.890,00:05:11.720,儿子明白,,,
00:05:13.560,00:05:14.670,你还要记得,00:05:11.990,00:05:13.151,I understand.
00:05:15.140,00:05:17.010,哪怕莞嫔有了子嗣,00:05:14.660,00:05:15.977,"And remember,"
00:05:17.690,00:05:19.520,你也不能过于宠爱她,00:05:16.240,00:05:18.240,"even though Concubine Sourire bears an heir,"
00:05:19.860,00:05:21.470,让她再恃宠生骄,00:05:18.790,00:05:22.724,"don't overly favor her and make her
 conceited over her status again."
00:05:22.780,00:05:26.110,哀家想皇后也不会反对吧,00:05:23.880,00:05:27.210,I don't believe the Empress will oppose this arrangement.
00:05:27.950,00:05:30.780,甄妹妹可以回宫自然是好啊,00:05:29.050,00:05:32.016,I'm certainly glad that Zhen can return to the palace.
00:05:31.450,00:05:33.240,臣妾也怪想她的,00:05:32.264,00:05:34.651,I miss her quite a lot.
00:05:36.920,00:05:39.250,这鹅梨帐中香的制法可不一般,00:05:38.020,00:05:40.640,The Goose Pear Bedside Incense requires a special technique.
00:05:39.710,00:05:41.200,先称沉香末一两,00:05:40.810,00:05:42.921,"First, weigh one tael of powdered agarwood"
00:05:44.050,00:05:45.160,檀香末一钱,00:05:45.150,00:05:46.880,and one mace of powdered sandalwood.
00:05:47.680,00:05:50.210,然后再将鹅梨去了中间的瓤核,00:05:48.780,00:05:51.310,Then remove the core of the goose pear
00:05:50.640,00:05:51.720,将香末倒进去,00:05:51.740,00:05:53.068,and pour the powder in.
00:05:54.020,00:05:55.800,再将鹅梨顶继续盖好,00:05:55.120,00:05:57.370,Put the top of the goose pear back carefully.
00:05:56.270,00:05:58.680,然后用那个小银瓮把这个盛好,00:05:57.370,00:05:59.780,Place the whole goose pear into this silver jar
00:05:59.060,00:06:00.140,放在火上蒸三溜,,,
00:06:00.860,00:06:02.020,蒸好了过来告诉我,00:05:59.780,00:06:01.731,and steam and chill it three times.
00:06:02.820,00:06:03.480,是,00:06:01.960,00:06:03.327,Come back to me once it's done.
00:06:06.610,00:06:08.270,不知皇后娘娘大驾光临,00:06:03.920,00:06:04.704,Yes.
00:06:08.570,00:06:10.610,臣妾未曾远迎 还望娘娘恕罪,00:06:07.710,00:06:11.680,Please forgive me for not noticing Your Majesty's honoring presence.
00:06:11.450,00:06:12.230,起来吧,,,
00:06:12.740,00:06:13.400,是,00:06:12.550,00:06:13.594,Rise.
,,,00:06:13.840,00:06:14.600,Yes.
00:06:14.330,00:06:16.440,本宫只是来看你如何制香,00:06:15.430,00:06:17.600,"I just came by to watch you making incense,"
00:06:16.830,00:06:19.200,没有叫人通传 自个儿便进来了,00:06:17.930,00:06:20.300,so I didn't ask them to announce my arrival.
00:06:19.620,00:06:21.290,皇后娘娘需要什么熏香,,,
00:06:21.670,00:06:23.250,你着下人过来通报一声,00:06:20.720,00:06:24.360,"If Your Majesty needs any incense,
you can have your servant send the order to me."
00:06:23.550,00:06:25.330,臣妾亲自给您送过去便是了,00:06:24.650,00:06:26.730,I will deliver the incense to Your Majesty myself.
00:06:25.630,00:06:28.290,只怕下人们说不清道不明,,,
00:06:28.630,00:06:30.970,让你摸不着头 制不出来不说,00:06:26.730,00:06:30.550,I'm afraid the servants can't transmit my words clearly and correctly.
00:06:31.260,00:06:32.420,倒把自己熏倒了,00:06:30.550,00:06:33.768,"Then you might become confused
and even choke yourself from the smoke."
00:06:33.050,00:06:35.590,臣妾愚笨 还请娘娘明示,00:06:34.150,00:06:37.021,I hope Your Majesty can enlighten my dull-witted mind.
00:06:36.810,00:06:39.050,皇上执意要接莞嫔入宫,00:06:37.910,00:06:40.316,His Majesty insists on bringing Concubine Sourire back.
00:06:39.390,00:06:42.140,你有什么香可以使皇上回心转意,00:06:40.490,00:06:43.613,Do you have any incense that can change his mind?
00:06:43.190,00:06:44.020,臣妾无能,00:06:44.290,00:06:45.451,I am incompetent.
00:06:44.610,00:06:46.850,不知皇后娘娘有何打算,00:06:45.710,00:06:47.950,Does Your Majesty have a plan?
00:06:47.190,00:06:48.480,能有什么打算,00:06:48.290,00:06:49.746,What plan could I have?
00:06:49.200,00:06:51.060,皇上一定要让她回宫,00:06:50.300,00:06:52.243,"His Majesty must have her back,"
00:06:51.530,00:06:53.110,本宫让她回宫便是,,,
00:06:53.620,00:06:54.820,在眼皮子底下,00:06:52.630,00:06:54.376,so I will let her come back.
00:06:55.160,00:06:58.320,总比在看不见的地方让人放心吧,00:06:54.720,00:06:59.400,Better to have her under my nose than out of my sight.
00:07:00.790,00:07:02.160,前日臣妾和你说,,,
00:07:02.580,00:07:04.250,要为莞嫔新建宫殿的事情,00:07:01.890,00:07:05.324,"I suggested a new palace should be built
for Concubine Sourire the other day."
00:07:04.540,00:07:05.330,可已定夺,,,
00:07:06.880,00:07:08.120,不提这事便罢,00:07:05.324,00:07:06.738,Have you decided yet?
00:07:08.420,00:07:10.000,一提这事叫人生气,00:07:07.980,00:07:11.452,"I wish you hadn't mentioned it.
It makes me mad when it's brought up."
00:07:12.140,00:07:13.300,怎么会这样呢,00:07:13.240,00:07:14.712,How is it that you feel this way?
00:07:16.510,00:07:20.680,今日朕在前朝把此事一提,00:07:17.610,00:07:18.288,Today ...
00:07:22.150,00:07:24.510,这众大臣就跟商量好了似的,00:07:19.445,00:07:22.276,"I brought this up in court,"
00:07:24.900,00:07:26.060,全都跳出来反对,00:07:23.250,00:07:27.160,"and all the officials opposed it
as if they had planned to in advance."
00:07:27.780,00:07:31.440,说什么西南水灾国库吃紧,00:07:28.880,00:07:32.841,"They said that the Treasury is on a tight budget
due to the floods in the southwest."
00:07:32.660,00:07:35.770,为了迎一个妃子入宫便大兴土木,00:07:33.760,00:07:37.120,"and that we might lose popular support
if we undertook"
00:07:36.620,00:07:40.450,只恐民心失稳小题大做,00:07:37.681,00:07:39.360,large-scale construction for a consort.
,,,00:07:40.010,00:07:42.240,"""A huge speech about a trivial topic!"""
00:07:41.250,00:07:43.830,大臣们向来如此总是小题大做,00:07:42.350,00:07:45.178,"The officials are always like that, fussing over small things."
00:07:44.380,00:07:46.290,皇上自己拿主意便是了,00:07:45.480,00:07:47.514,It's Your Majesty's decision after all.
00:07:46.710,00:07:50.450,群臣反对 此事硬做亦是不妥,00:07:47.810,00:07:51.550,It'd be improper to go against all the officials.
00:07:51.510,00:07:52.750,朕已经想好了,00:07:52.610,00:07:54.365,I have decided
00:07:53.720,00:07:56.080,让内务府把永寿宫整修出来,00:07:54.738,00:07:57.476,"that the Household Department will refurbish
the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:07:56.390,00:07:57.670,谅他们也不好再说什么,00:07:57.476,00:07:59.530,I don't think the officials will oppose.
00:07:58.430,00:07:59.390,这样也好,00:07:59.530,00:08:00.490,Just as well.
00:07:59.890,00:08:02.180,只要莞嫔不觉得委屈就好了,00:08:00.990,00:08:03.360,As long as Concubine Sourire won't feel aggrieved.
00:08:03.190,00:08:04.800,不过让他们这么一提,00:08:04.290,00:08:05.858,But their opinions
00:08:06.060,00:08:07.400,朕倒觉得此事,,,
00:08:07.730,00:08:08.970,还得再下点别的功夫,00:08:06.976,00:08:10.080,made me feel I need to put some further thought into this.
00:08:10.150,00:08:12.690,他们反对朕迎废妃入宫,00:08:11.250,00:08:13.963,They oppose my decision to bring back a banished consort
00:08:13.110,00:08:16.480,不外是说甄氏是罪臣之女,00:08:13.963,00:08:17.589,saying that Zhen is the daughter of a guilty official
00:08:17.370,00:08:19.320,汉军旗下五旗出身,00:08:18.251,00:08:20.578,and is from the lower five Han banners.
00:08:20.160,00:08:24.070,出身既不高贵又不曾诞育皇子,00:08:21.260,00:08:25.170,"They said she doesn't have a noble background nor given birth to a prince,"
00:08:24.540,00:08:27.660,就连腹中的孩子也未知男女,00:08:25.640,00:08:28.926,and that the gender of the child in her belly is still unknown.
00:08:28.290,00:08:29.450,如此种种,00:08:29.390,00:08:30.757,"Considering all this,"
00:08:29.880,00:08:32.290,看来眼下的确不宜接莞嫔回宫,00:08:30.980,00:08:33.763,"it does not seem like a good time
to bring Concubine Sourire back."
00:08:32.920,00:08:33.710,那不如,,,
00:08:34.220,00:08:35.380,朕心已决,00:08:34.020,00:08:35.100,How about...
,,,00:08:35.320,00:08:36.640,I've made up my mind.
00:08:36.340,00:08:38.800,既是汉军旗下五旗出身,00:08:37.440,00:08:40.000,"She came from the lower five Han banners,"
00:08:39.510,00:08:40.970,朕就给她台旗,00:08:40.610,00:08:41.920,but I'll promote her
00:08:41.640,00:08:44.600,升为满军旗上三旗,00:08:42.594,00:08:45.889,"to the top three Manchu banners,"
00:08:45.190,00:08:47.850,赐大姓钮佑禄氏,00:08:46.290,00:08:49.654,"and grant her the surname Niohuru
of the prominent Manchu clan."
00:08:49.190,00:08:50.980,此事皇上可要三思啊,00:08:50.290,00:08:52.246,I hope Your Majesty will reconsider.
00:08:52.030,00:08:55.390,皇上若要赏甄氏脸面要赐姓,00:08:53.130,00:08:56.490,"If Your Majesty would like to award Zhen a prestigious surname,"
00:08:55.780,00:08:58.520,可以在甄姓的后面加一佳字,00:08:56.880,00:08:59.260,"you could append ""Jia"" to her surname"
00:08:59.030,00:09:01.150,台为甄佳氏即可呀,00:08:59.260,00:09:02.550,"so that her surname would be Zhenjia.
[Adding Jia to a surname is an honor.]"
00:09:01.450,00:09:02.320,赐姓之后,,,
00:09:02.790,00:09:05.370,便不再是罪臣甄远道之女了,00:09:02.550,00:09:06.600,"With her new surname, she is no longer
the daughter of the guilty official Zhen Yuandao."
00:09:07.420,00:09:08.370,既无皇子,00:09:08.520,00:09:10.000,"She has no sons,"
00:09:09.540,00:09:12.080,后宫里有的是没有额娘的阿哥,00:09:10.640,00:09:13.767,but there is also a prince who has no mother in the harem.
00:09:13.720,00:09:15.580,皇上是指四阿哥,00:09:14.820,00:09:16.846,Does Your Majesty mean the Fourth Prince?
00:09:17.300,00:09:20.040,可是四阿哥出身微贱,00:09:18.400,00:09:21.223,But the Fourth Prince is from a humble birth.
00:09:20.310,00:09:21.720,正因为出身微贱,,,
00:09:22.770,00:09:25.930,所以才需要一个有身份的额娘,00:09:21.410,00:09:27.000,That's exactly why he needs a mother from a distinguished family.
00:09:27.100,00:09:27.890,从今往后,,,
00:09:28.610,00:09:29.560,四阿哥的生母,00:09:28.200,00:09:29.321,"From today on,"
00:09:29.900,00:09:31.730,便不再是宫女李金桂了,00:09:29.710,00:09:32.888,"the Fourth Prince's mother is no longer the maid Li Jingui,"
00:09:32.320,00:09:35.350,而是朕的妃子钮佑禄甄嬛,00:09:33.420,00:09:36.640,but my Consort Niohuru Zhen Huan.
00:09:36.780,00:09:39.490,可是莞嫔才二十二岁,00:09:37.880,00:09:40.989,But Concubine Sourire is only twenty-two years old
00:09:39.870,00:09:41.980,跟四阿哥他只差了七岁,00:09:40.989,00:09:43.204,- just seven years older than the Fourth Prince.
00:09:42.370,00:09:44.200,怎么能做四阿哥的额娘呢,00:09:43.470,00:09:45.520,How can she be the Fourth Prince's mother?
00:09:44.500,00:09:45.240,这事不难,00:09:45.520,00:09:46.560,That's not difficult.
00:09:46.000,00:09:49.240,就当嬛嬛是生了四阿哥,00:09:47.100,00:09:50.340,I will announce that Huanhuan left the palace to pray for the nation
00:09:49.880,00:09:52.490,才离宫为国祈福,00:09:50.980,00:09:53.590,after giving birth to the Fourth Prince.
00:09:53.250,00:09:54.620,这样便不算是废妃,00:09:54.350,00:09:55.886,Then she's not a banished consort.
00:09:56.220,00:09:59.080,年龄的事更是小事,00:09:57.320,00:10:00.457,"As for her age, that's simple."
00:09:59.590,00:10:00.630,就是添上十岁,,,
00:10:01.430,00:10:03.670,称作三十二岁又有何妨,00:10:00.457,00:10:04.800,What harm would it do if I say she's thirty-two years old.
00:10:04.350,00:10:07.220,皇上执意如此臣妾也无法了,00:10:05.450,00:10:08.320,I'll agree if Your Majesty insists.
00:10:07.730,00:10:10.340,只是怕堵不住那悠悠之口,00:10:08.830,00:10:11.564,I'm just afraid that this won't stop the gossip.
00:10:10.650,00:10:12.060,人言何所畏惧,,,
00:10:13.070,00:10:14.770,他们愿意议论也好,00:10:11.750,00:10:13.850,What's there to be afraid of from gossip?
00:10:15.690,00:10:16.810,不愿意也罢,00:10:14.400,00:10:18.272,"No matter if they gossip about it or not,"
00:10:17.450,00:10:20.190,朕已决意要给嬛嬛妃位,00:10:18.520,00:10:21.528,I am determined to give Huanhuan the title of Consort.
00:10:24.950,00:10:26.030,这个莞字不好,00:10:26.050,00:10:27.773,"The name ""Sourire"" is not good."
00:10:27.710,00:10:30.290,为了从前的事生出许多风波来,00:10:28.766,00:10:31.526,It caused so many troubles in the past.
00:10:31.170,00:10:33.530,朕要给她改个封号,00:10:32.270,00:10:34.878,I will also change her honorary name.
00:10:35.210,00:10:37.370,往事暗沈不可追,00:10:36.310,00:10:38.553,The past is gloomy and cannot be retraced
00:10:38.930,00:10:41.130,来日之路光明灿烂,00:10:40.030,00:10:42.483,but the path forward is full of brilliant light.
00:10:42.680,00:10:43.920,就取个熹字,00:10:43.780,00:10:45.407,I will name her Lumière.
00:10:45.390,00:10:48.600,为光明灿烂之意如何,00:10:46.318,00:10:47.940,"""The brilliant light."""
,,,00:10:48.892,00:10:50.000,What do you think?
00:10:53.230,00:10:55.470,臣妾觉得极好,00:10:54.330,00:10:56.570,"It is excellent, Your Majesty."
00:10:58.650,00:11:00.520,宫中一切都已打点妥当,00:10:59.750,00:11:01.703,Everything is ready in the palace.
00:11:00.990,00:11:02.780,不日就能接娘娘回宫了,00:11:02.090,00:11:04.170,Your Highness will be able to return in a few days.
00:11:03.910,00:11:06.370,皇上说要封娘娘为熹妃,,,
00:11:06.700,00:11:07.570,住永寿宫,00:11:05.010,00:11:09.012,"His Majesty will promote Your Highness to Consort Lumière
and grant you the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:11:08.200,00:11:09.790,还让您抚养四阿哥呢,00:11:09.300,00:11:11.287,Your Highness will also foster the Fourth Prince.
00:11:11.290,00:11:12.080,四阿哥,,,
00:11:12.380,00:11:13.080,是啊,00:11:12.390,00:11:13.480,The Fourth Prince?
00:11:14.000,00:11:15.330,娘娘原本是废妃,00:11:13.480,00:11:14.180,Yes.
00:11:15.630,00:11:18.240,要回宫外头闲话极多,00:11:15.100,00:11:19.320,"Your Highness was a banished consort.
There was too much gossip about it outside the palace."
00:11:18.920,00:11:19.750,为避嫌疑,,,
00:11:20.220,00:11:22.920,皇上赐娘娘姓钮佑禄氏,00:11:20.020,00:11:24.000,"To sidestep these comments, His Majesty grants
Your Highness the surname Niohuru"
00:11:23.640,00:11:25.420,假称为四阿哥的生母,,,
00:11:25.930,00:11:28.260,就连岁数都加了十岁,00:11:24.740,00:11:27.314,and explains that you are the Fourth Prince's mother.
00:11:28.770,00:11:29.800,称三十二岁,00:11:27.314,00:11:31.058,"To make this believable, His Majesty
 added ten years to your age ."
00:11:30.350,00:11:31.180,三十二,00:11:31.450,00:11:32.570,"So, thirty-two?"
00:11:32.020,00:11:34.510,我们娘子怎么像三十二岁呢,00:11:33.120,00:11:35.941,Our mistress doesn't look like thirty-two at all!
00:11:35.610,00:11:36.640,当然不像了,00:11:36.710,00:11:37.920,Of course not.
00:11:37.070,00:11:39.480,那是为了掩人口实罢了,,,
00:11:39.780,00:11:41.020,省得再有闲话,00:11:38.170,00:11:42.120,This is just to prevent any fodder for gossip.
00:11:42.070,00:11:43.230,这些都是小事,00:11:43.170,00:11:44.800,These are trivial matters.
00:11:43.990,00:11:46.360,皇上做主自然是好的,00:11:45.090,00:11:47.600,I appreciate His Majesty's decision.
00:11:47.790,00:11:48.570,皇上还说,,,
00:11:48.950,00:11:51.110,娘娘住在凌云峰太不像样了,00:11:48.890,00:11:52.324,"His Majesty also said that
Peak Lingyun is too inadequate to live in."
00:11:51.870,00:11:54.960,还得委屈娘娘至甘露寺暂住几日,00:11:52.970,00:11:56.296,"Your Highness will be troubled to reside in
the Temple of Pure Dew for a few days."
00:11:55.290,00:11:57.120,再从甘露寺接回娘娘,00:11:56.296,00:11:58.793,And then Your Highness will return to the palace from the temple.
00:11:58.170,00:11:59.380,皇上安排就是,00:11:59.270,00:12:01.060,I will follow His Majesty's arrangements.
00:12:00.340,00:12:03.170,谅那甘露寺也不会有什么异议,00:12:01.440,00:12:04.436,I don't suppose the Temple of Pure Dew will disagree.
00:12:04.220,00:12:05.080,如今再回去,,,
00:12:05.430,00:12:06.590,甘露寺那起子小人,00:12:05.320,00:12:06.590,Returning to the temple now -
00:12:06.970,00:12:08.050,不知道要成什么样子的,00:12:06.590,00:12:09.477,I wonder how those petty snobs will react!
00:12:08.560,00:12:09.670,想想就觉得痛快,00:12:09.684,00:12:11.187,What a delight!
00:12:14.810,00:12:17.470,娘子怎么还没有梳妆呢,00:12:15.910,00:12:18.800,"Mistress, why aren't you ready?"
00:12:18.360,00:12:21.600,等下苏培盛可就要来宣旨回宫了,00:12:19.460,00:12:22.800,Su Peisheng will be here soon to deliver His Majesty's decree.
00:12:26.740,00:12:27.860,浣碧替我梳妆吧,00:12:27.840,00:12:29.440,"Jade, please do my hair."
00:12:41.340,00:12:43.880,娘子此番回宫,00:12:42.440,00:12:45.241,"Mistress, to return to the palace,"
00:12:45.640,00:12:48.380,有些东西你是一定要舍弃了,00:12:46.483,00:12:49.600,there are some things you must leave behind.
00:12:50.640,00:12:51.350,比如,00:12:51.740,00:12:52.840,Including...
00:12:55.440,00:12:56.020,心,,,
00:12:58.560,00:12:59.470,不是狠心,00:12:56.540,00:12:57.600,your heart.
00:13:00.730,00:13:02.140,狠心亦是有心,00:12:59.660,00:13:01.642,"This doesn't mean to have a cruel heart,"
,,,00:13:01.843,00:13:03.957,because that still implies feelings.
00:13:04.150,00:13:06.770,娘娘要做的是狠,00:13:05.100,00:13:06.400,Your Highness must become
00:13:08.030,00:13:08.990,而无心,00:13:06.995,00:13:07.985,cruel
,,,00:13:09.008,00:13:10.623,with no feelings in your heart at all.
00:13:13.370,00:13:16.960,槿汐除了你,00:13:14.470,00:13:15.615,"Jinxi,"
00:13:18.540,00:13:19.280,便再也没有人,00:13:17.146,00:13:18.642,no one else
00:13:19.630,00:13:20.740,会对我说这样的话了,00:13:19.511,00:13:21.964,would say such things to me.
00:13:28.510,00:13:31.420,奉天承运 皇帝诏曰,00:13:29.610,00:13:31.167,"By the grace of Heaven,"
,,,00:13:31.523,00:13:32.876,His Majesty decrees:

00:16:16.350,00:16:17.930,你这回来了,00:16:17.450,00:16:19.030,Now you are back...
00:16:19.020,00:16:19.800,可嬛儿,00:16:20.120,00:16:21.148,But Huan'er...
00:16:20.980,00:16:22.310,她不在这儿了,00:16:22.080,00:16:23.576,is no longer here.
00:16:25.230,00:16:26.940,额娘你说什么,00:16:26.330,00:16:28.040,"What do you mean, Mother?"

00:16:38.580,00:16:39.780,允礼你要明白,00:16:39.680,00:16:41.128,"Yunli, you must understand."
00:16:41.790,00:16:45.500,嬛儿她或许有难言苦衷啊,00:16:42.890,00:16:46.600,Perhaps Huan'er has some reasons she can't speak of.
00:16:49.130,00:16:50.580,嬛儿跟额娘一样,00:16:50.230,00:16:51.846,We both thought...
00:16:51.630,00:16:52.500,都以为你,,,
00:16:53.380,00:16:54.670,你不在了,00:16:52.730,00:16:54.326,that you were ...
00:16:57.390,00:16:58.840,可即便是有种种传言,00:16:54.616,00:16:55.926,you were gone.
00:17:00.010,00:17:01.090,就算她有为难之处,00:16:58.490,00:17:00.230,"But even though there were rumors,"
00:17:01.310,00:17:02.170,可是嬛儿她,00:17:01.110,00:17:02.410,Even if she had difficulties...
,,,00:17:02.410,00:17:03.477,Huan'er is...
00:17:06.900,00:17:09.730,允礼 人各有志,00:17:08.000,00:17:11.040,"Yunli, aspirations differ from person to person."
00:17:11.980,00:17:13.820,你千万不要记恨嬛儿,00:17:13.080,00:17:14.920,Do not hate Huan'er.
00:17:16.070,00:17:17.400,总有一天,00:17:17.170,00:17:18.500,"One day,"
00:17:19.330,00:17:21.490,你会明白嬛儿的难处,00:17:20.430,00:17:22.590,you will know her hardship.
00:17:23.080,00:17:23.690,额娘,00:17:24.180,00:17:25.121,"Mother,"
00:17:25.250,00:17:26.080,我要去找她,00:17:26.350,00:17:27.759,I'm going to find her.
00:17:27.040,00:17:28.830,我要去找嬛儿 找她问个清楚,00:17:28.140,00:17:30.000,I need to ask her about all this!

00:17:39.300,00:17:40.790,回宫的圣旨已下,00:17:40.400,00:17:42.138,His Majesty's decree has been delivered.
00:17:42.560,00:17:44.970,以后就再也看不到宫外的蓝天了,00:17:43.660,00:17:46.280,I will never see the blue skies outside the palace.
00:17:48.350,00:17:49.010,嬛儿,00:17:49.450,00:17:50.400,Huan'er!
00:17:54.650,00:17:55.140,嬛儿,00:17:55.750,00:17:56.540,Huan'er!
00:18:02.450,00:18:03.070,王爷,00:18:03.550,00:18:04.460,Your Lordship!
00:18:14.840,00:18:17.380,嬛儿 你是在等我吗,00:18:15.940,00:18:18.614,"Huan'er, are you sitting here waiting for me?"
00:18:25.810,00:18:28.600,你看娘娘大喜的日子,00:18:26.806,00:18:29.779,"Jade, today is a big day for Her Highness."
00:18:29.730,00:18:31.590,姑娘把衣裳哭湿了多不好啊,00:18:30.781,00:18:32.879,You shouldn't wet your dress with tears.
00:18:32.440,00:18:33.980,去换一身喜庆的衣裳吧,00:18:33.476,00:18:35.306,Go change into something festive.
00:18:35.480,00:18:36.470,王爷平安无事,,,
00:18:37.070,00:18:38.780,我这就去给菩萨上香,00:18:36.492,00:18:38.082,"Seeing Your Lordship return safely,"
,,,00:18:38.082,00:18:40.000,I must go offer incense to Buddha.
00:18:44.620,00:18:47.110,圣旨已下万事不能再回头,00:18:45.695,00:18:48.516,"His Majesty's decree has been delivered.
There is no turning back."
00:18:47.790,00:18:49.120,此时若是感情用事,00:18:48.810,00:18:50.596,"If you let emotions hold sway now,"
00:18:50.370,00:18:52.490,怕日后后患无穷,00:18:51.445,00:18:53.648,there will be endless troubles in the future.
00:18:59.050,00:18:59.790,娘娘,00:19:00.000,00:19:01.154,"""Her Highness""?"
00:19:02.430,00:19:03.790,你果然回宫去了,00:19:03.442,00:19:05.600,So it is true - you are going back to the palace.
00:19:07.980,00:19:09.430,没想到有生之年,00:19:09.096,00:19:10.808,I never expected that
00:19:13.400,00:19:15.640,竟能见到王爷平安归来,00:19:14.468,00:19:16.874,I could witness Your Lordship's safe return in my lifetime.
00:19:16.780,00:19:17.440,王爷,00:19:17.665,00:19:18.808,"""Your Lordship""?"
00:19:19.200,00:19:20.030,一别四月,00:19:20.197,00:19:21.377,"After only four months,"
00:19:21.570,00:19:22.730,变化竟如此之快,00:19:22.606,00:19:24.283,everything has so quickly changed.
00:19:24.950,00:19:25.990,你又成娘娘了,00:19:26.033,00:19:27.445,"You are ""Her Highness"" again."
00:19:29.290,00:19:31.240,大概是许久没有听到这样的称呼,00:19:30.302,00:19:32.960,Perhaps because it's been so long since I heard you addressed like that
00:19:32.460,00:19:33.240,生疏了,00:19:33.512,00:19:34.582,it feels distant.
00:19:35.670,00:19:36.660,你回来就好,00:19:36.651,00:19:38.069,I am glad you are back.
00:19:38.300,00:19:39.540,我情愿死在滇藏,00:19:39.375,00:19:40.982,I wish I died back there in Tibet!
00:19:41.180,00:19:42.090,永远不要回来,00:19:42.177,00:19:43.573,I wish I had never come back!
00:19:44.890,00:19:45.630,嬛儿,00:19:45.910,00:19:46.857,Huan'er.
00:19:47.720,00:19:49.960,我是想着你我才能回来的呀,00:19:48.946,00:19:51.310,It was the thought of you that helped me come back.
00:19:52.560,00:19:53.270,可我一回来,00:19:53.549,00:19:54.880,"But the moment I return,"
00:19:54.940,00:19:57.060,却要亲眼看见你被迎回宫去,00:19:56.040,00:19:58.510,"I have to watch you being escorted back to the palace,"
00:19:58.900,00:20:00.110,回到皇兄身边,,,
00:20:00.400,00:20:01.190,你若不回来,00:20:00.000,00:20:01.268,back to my brother's side.
,,,00:20:01.293,00:20:02.497,"If you hadn't come back,"
00:20:02.570,00:20:04.560,就会一直以为我等着你盼着你,00:20:03.582,00:20:05.820,you would've assumed I was forever waiting for you.
00:20:05.990,00:20:06.860,你若不回来,00:20:07.003,00:20:08.204,"If you hadn't come back,"
00:20:08.330,00:20:08.910,就不会知道,,,
00:20:09.200,00:20:11.070,我是这样一个无情无义的女子,00:20:09.358,00:20:12.294,you wouldn't have realized what a heartless woman I am.
00:20:14.500,00:20:16.540,我本就是一个无情无义的女子,00:20:15.639,00:20:18.076,I have always been this heartless woman!
00:20:21.510,00:20:23.590,无情无义,00:20:22.499,00:20:24.706,Heart... less?
00:20:31.060,00:20:32.220,无情无义,00:20:32.048,00:20:33.390,Heartless!
00:20:36.150,00:20:38.850,本宫愧对王爷再说也无益,00:20:37.098,00:20:39.871,"I'm ashamed of what I've done to Your Lordship.
There's no more to be said."
00:20:39.780,00:20:40.690,王爷请回吧,00:20:40.784,00:20:42.233,"Please go back, Your Lordship."
00:21:10.640,00:21:12.720,太妃浣碧姑娘来了,00:21:11.660,00:21:13.823,"Your Venerable Highness, Jade is here."
00:21:14.350,00:21:15.180,太妃万福,00:21:15.394,00:21:16.721,Grace to Your Venerable Highness.
00:21:16.310,00:21:17.180,你怎么来了,00:21:17.346,00:21:18.547,What brings you here?
00:21:18.020,00:21:20.730,小姐让我来找王爷的,00:21:19.072,00:21:21.989,My Lady sent me to look for His Lordship.
00:21:21.570,00:21:22.270,嬛儿怎么说,00:21:22.670,00:21:23.991,What did Huan'er say?
00:21:33.450,00:21:34.410,一切可妥当,,,
00:21:35.660,00:21:36.620,王爷请勿担心,00:21:34.685,00:21:36.142,Will it be safe to do so?
00:21:38.420,00:21:39.120,好,00:21:36.760,00:21:38.341,"Yes, please don't worry, Your Lordship."
00:21:40.210,00:21:41.500,我会准时在那里等候,00:21:39.615,00:21:40.522,Good.
,,,00:21:41.262,00:21:43.131,I will be waiting there at that time.
00:21:44.880,00:21:45.540,王爷,00:21:45.932,00:21:46.882,Your Lordship.
00:21:47.640,00:21:48.340,保重,00:21:48.723,00:21:49.754,Take care.
00:22:04.360,00:22:05.690,额娘儿子有事,00:22:05.460,00:22:07.038,"Mother, I have to go..."
00:22:06.280,00:22:06.940,去吧,00:22:07.308,00:22:08.382,Just go.
00:22:17.710,00:22:19.910,太妃王爷这样难过,00:22:18.722,00:22:21.341,"Your Venerable Highness, His Lordship is so sad."
00:22:20.630,00:22:22.240,你何不叫他知道实情,00:22:21.706,00:22:23.671,Why don't you tell him the truth?
00:22:23.670,00:22:25.710,我何尝想他这般痛苦啊,00:22:24.714,00:22:27.287,I also don't want to see him suffer like this.
00:22:28.470,00:22:30.050,如果告之他实情,00:22:29.570,00:22:31.398,"But if I told him the truth,"
00:22:30.800,00:22:32.040,以允礼的脾气,00:22:31.900,00:22:33.495,"given Yunli's temperament,"
00:22:33.510,00:22:34.720,必将不顾一切,,,
00:22:35.020,00:22:36.760,想带着嬛儿远走高飞,00:22:34.610,00:22:38.108,he would try to steal away with Huan'er no matter the cost.
00:22:38.390,00:22:40.060,那皇帝也必将知道,,,
00:22:40.350,00:22:42.350,嬛儿腹中的孩子非他所生,00:22:39.490,00:22:43.788,"And then the Emperor would know that
Huan'er is not pregnant with his child."
00:22:43.480,00:22:47.320,可如此 王爷怕要深怨娘子了,00:22:44.580,00:22:48.586,"But now, I'm afraid His Lordship will be
deeply resentful towards Mistress Mochou."
00:22:50.450,00:22:54.530,非如此 大家都会有性命之忧啊,00:22:51.550,00:22:52.858,"Otherwise,"
,,,00:22:53.627,00:22:55.956,all our lives would be at stake.
00:22:55.660,00:22:56.400,如今,00:22:56.760,00:22:58.187,"At the moment,"
00:22:57.710,00:23:02.450,我们也只有两害相权取其轻罢了,00:22:58.766,00:23:03.842,we must choose the lesser of two harms.

00:23:21.730,00:23:23.010,你终于还肯来见我,00:23:22.830,00:23:24.770,You finally wanted to see me.
00:23:25.570,00:23:26.600,看你平安归来,00:23:26.670,00:23:28.691,"Now that I see you've returned safely,"
00:23:28.190,00:23:29.560,我也可以安心回宫了,00:23:29.290,00:23:31.608,I can return to the palace with my mind at peace.
00:23:33.160,00:23:33.900,只为这个,,,
00:23:36.120,00:23:37.030,那王爷以为呢,00:23:34.260,00:23:36.020,You came here only to tell me this?
00:23:38.250,00:23:38.980,一别多日,00:23:37.220,00:23:38.656,What did Your Lordship think?
00:23:40.330,00:23:41.490,你竟不问我去了哪里,00:23:39.350,00:23:40.991,"We were separated for so long,"
00:23:41.870,00:23:42.910,问与不问很重要吗,00:23:41.223,00:23:42.970,and you haven't even asked where I was.
,,,00:23:42.970,00:23:44.800,Does it matter whether I asked or not?
00:23:49.630,00:23:51.370,看你安然无恙站在我面前,00:23:50.730,00:23:53.122,"Now that I see you standing in front of me unscathed,"
00:23:53.180,00:23:54.210,我已经无所牵挂了,,,
00:23:55.470,00:23:57.090,我安然无恙你才无所牵挂,00:23:53.969,00:23:56.056,I have nothing left to worry about.
00:23:57.720,00:23:59.300,想必他日人人传我身死,00:23:56.570,00:23:58.613,"If you stopped worrying because I'm unharmed,"
00:23:59.930,00:24:01.090,你必定是日夜牵挂,00:23:58.640,00:24:00.640,then you must have been worried about me day and night
00:24:01.850,00:24:02.470,对吗,00:24:00.640,00:24:02.695,when rumors were spoken about my death.
00:24:04.190,00:24:05.800,素闻王爷心有七窍,00:24:02.950,00:24:04.192,Am I right?
00:24:08.860,00:24:10.400,想来王爷真是多心了,00:24:05.290,00:24:07.656,"Truly your Lordship's heart is ""as perceptive as seven hearts,"""
00:24:12.820,00:24:14.150,你我早已两心相映,00:24:09.960,00:24:12.297,but Your Lordship is using six hearts too many.
00:24:15.070,00:24:15.860,今日你乍然回宫,00:24:13.920,00:24:15.623,Our hearts already beat as one.
00:24:16.160,00:24:17.490,所以才要刻意冷淡我,00:24:16.170,00:24:18.920,"You're acting cold only because you have to
return to the palace all of a sudden."
00:24:17.910,00:24:18.650,允礼,00:24:19.010,00:24:20.000,"Yunli,"
00:24:22.250,00:24:23.450,我们的缘分已尽,00:24:23.350,00:24:25.167,our shared fate has come to an end.
00:24:24.460,00:24:25.200,缘分,00:24:25.560,00:24:26.611,Our fate?
00:24:27.340,00:24:28.950,从前于男女情分上,,,
00:24:29.300,00:24:30.910,你说你从不相信缘分一说,00:24:28.440,00:24:32.536,"You said you never believed in fate
when it comes to love and affection."
00:24:32.010,00:24:32.840,唯有软弱无力,,,
00:24:33.180,00:24:34.010,自己不肯争取的人,,,
00:24:34.260,00:24:35.590,才会以缘分作为托词,00:24:33.110,00:24:37.600,"Fate is used as a pretense by the weak and spineless
who wouldn't even put up a fight!"
00:24:36.550,00:24:39.140,缘分深重便是相近的藉口,00:24:37.650,00:24:40.454,You said “deeply shared fate” is an excuse to get attached to someone
00:24:39.720,00:24:41.340,已无缘便是了却情意的假词,00:24:40.454,00:24:42.440,and “we are not fated” is a pretense to end it.
00:24:41.520,00:24:42.300,我亦说过,00:24:42.440,00:24:43.886,I also said that
00:24:43.600,00:24:45.810,真到了无路可去 无法可解的地步,00:24:44.700,00:24:47.158,"one day if I had nowhere to go and no future,"
00:24:46.560,00:24:49.560,我才会说缘分已尽了,00:24:47.660,00:24:50.660,"then I would say ""It must have been fated."""
00:24:52.030,00:24:53.190,我现在只想告诉你,00:24:53.130,00:24:55.000,I'm only here to tell you
00:24:54.660,00:24:56.400,我只想了却我和你的情意,00:24:55.760,00:24:58.210,that all I want is to end the affection between us.
00:24:59.330,00:25:00.610,想必有人已经告诉你,00:25:00.430,00:25:02.509,Someone must have told you
00:25:03.460,00:25:04.440,我已怀孕三个月,00:25:04.560,00:25:06.532,that I'm three months pregnant.
00:25:07.540,00:25:08.280,三个月,00:25:08.640,00:25:09.920,Three months.
00:25:10.630,00:25:12.170,你应该知道这孩子不是你的,00:25:11.730,00:25:13.714,You should know that this child is not yours.
00:25:17.300,00:25:19.630,不错 三个月,00:25:18.400,00:25:21.015,"Yes, three months..."
00:25:21.430,00:25:22.720,便是我才走一个月,00:25:22.530,00:25:24.303,That must mean...
00:25:24.310,00:25:25.850,你便和皇兄在一起了,00:25:25.172,00:25:27.779,You reconciled with His Majesty only one month after I left.
00:25:27.900,00:25:30.510,人人都传我死了 那不要紧,00:25:29.000,00:25:31.921,"At that time everyone believed that I was dead,"
00:25:31.650,00:25:33.110,你自求保全也没有错,00:25:32.750,00:25:34.595,so you were not wrong to protect yourself.
00:25:33.690,00:25:34.600,我只是痛心,00:25:34.595,00:25:35.920,But my heart aches for you...
00:25:35.950,00:25:36.650,嬛儿,00:25:37.050,00:25:38.016,Huan'er.
00:25:38.820,00:25:41.110,你是从宫里死了心走出来的,00:25:39.920,00:25:42.293,You came out of the palace with your heart dead.
00:25:42.240,00:25:44.740,为何还要回到伤心地去苦苦经营,00:25:43.340,00:25:46.240,"Why are you returning to that heart-rending place
to have your mind exhausted again?"
00:25:47.080,00:25:48.120,我真的是不忍,00:25:48.180,00:25:49.620,I can't bear to see that.
00:25:50.170,00:25:50.830,我情愿,,,
00:25:53.510,00:25:54.670,我情愿是温实初,00:25:51.270,00:25:52.696,I would rather...
00:25:55.010,00:25:55.960,一生一世来照顾你,00:25:54.610,00:25:57.400,"I would rather that Wen Shichu was the one
who would take care of you for the rest of your life -"
00:25:56.300,00:25:57.670,至少他对你是真心的,,,
00:25:58.010,00:25:59.630,我想要的唯有你皇兄可以给我,00:25:57.400,00:25:58.936,at least he has a true heart for you.
00:26:00.930,00:26:01.790,我父亲的性命,00:25:59.110,00:26:00.960,Only His Majesty can grant me what I want.
00:26:02.680,00:26:03.800,我甄氏一族的活路,00:26:02.030,00:26:03.360,"My father's life,"
00:26:04.480,00:26:05.810,还有我要的荣华富贵,00:26:03.780,00:26:05.332,"a chance to live for the Zhen clan,"
00:26:07.140,00:26:08.300,我在甘露寺数年,00:26:05.580,00:26:07.337,and a life of opulence and glory for me.
00:26:08.650,00:26:09.810,我受尽凌辱与白眼,00:26:08.240,00:26:11.522,"I've suffered enough cold shoulders and humiliation
these years at the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:26:10.860,00:26:13.020,我为鱼肉的日子我过怕了,00:26:11.960,00:26:14.941,"I've had enough of ""living like meat
between the knife and chopping board."""
00:26:14.740,00:26:15.570,我不相信,,,
00:26:16.860,00:26:18.070,荣华富贵,00:26:15.840,00:26:17.158,I don't believe that.
00:26:18.780,00:26:20.770,荣华富贵何时能入得了你的眼,00:26:17.960,00:26:19.360,Opulence and glory?
00:26:22.530,00:26:24.020,如果你真要拿这套说辞,00:26:19.880,00:26:22.225,How can your noble eyes be captured by that?
00:26:24.410,00:26:25.240,来压低自己,00:26:23.630,00:26:26.351,"If you are using that excuse and belittling yourself,"
00:26:26.080,00:26:27.410,那就是把我对你的情意,,,
00:26:27.750,00:26:28.860,一起都压低了,00:26:27.180,00:26:30.000,then you also belittle my feelings for you.
00:26:30.000,00:26:32.830,我允礼真心爱护的女子,00:26:31.100,00:26:33.930,The woman I love wholeheartedly
00:26:33.750,00:26:34.790,岂是这样的人,,,
00:26:35.420,00:26:36.960,王爷当真是看错人了,00:26:34.850,00:26:36.345,is not someone like this!
00:26:38.180,00:26:39.630,我就是凡夫俗子,00:26:36.520,00:26:38.184,Your Lordship was deluded by your eyes!
00:26:40.550,00:26:41.630,我想要活得好,00:26:39.280,00:26:40.730,I'm a mortal with earthly desires.
00:26:42.390,00:26:43.840,我想要身边的人活得好,00:26:41.650,00:26:42.978,I want to live a good life.
00:26:44.720,00:26:45.960,我不想再被人践踏,00:26:43.490,00:26:45.023,I want people around me to live a good life.
,,,00:26:45.820,00:26:47.391,I no longer want to be trampled upon!
00:26:51.860,00:26:52.640,那日,,,
00:26:53.900,00:26:55.360,我的船在黄河沉没,00:26:52.960,00:26:53.988,"On that day,"
00:26:56.400,00:26:57.690,所有的东西都被冲走,00:26:55.207,00:26:56.708,my ship sank in the Yellow River.
00:26:58.650,00:26:59.940,若非我自幼熟悉水性,00:26:57.500,00:26:59.040,All my possessions were washed away.
00:27:00.570,00:27:02.030,现在恐怕早已沈尸河底,00:26:59.750,00:27:01.412,"If I hadn't been a good swimmer since childhood,"
00:27:04.160,00:27:05.490,我好不容易游上岸,00:27:01.670,00:27:03.430,my corpse would be lying underwater right now.
00:27:06.620,00:27:07.610,却被埋伏在周围的,00:27:05.260,00:27:06.921,"I swam to the bank with great difficulty,"
00:27:08.000,00:27:09.030,准葛尔细作制伏,00:27:07.720,00:27:09.820,but was captured by Dzungar spies lying in ambush.
00:27:09.410,00:27:10.870,把我从胧南带往准葛尔,00:27:10.000,00:27:12.000,They took me from Longnan to Dzungar.
00:27:12.330,00:27:13.290,你还记得那一日,,,
00:27:14.040,00:27:14.700,在山上被我救下的,00:27:13.430,00:27:14.762,Do you remember the man
00:27:15.130,00:27:16.460,那名被蛇咬的男子吗,00:27:15.140,00:27:17.731,who we saved from snakebite in the mountain?
00:27:17.380,00:27:20.120,他就是准葛尔汗王的长子摩格,00:27:18.480,00:27:21.220,"He's the eldest son of Dzungar's Khagan Tsewang.
His name is Galdan."
00:27:21.180,00:27:23.040,我这次去就是中了他的埋伏,00:27:22.280,00:27:24.140,He was the one who ambushed my ship.
00:27:25.310,00:27:27.970,他知道我的身份 待我还算不薄,00:27:26.410,00:27:29.070,He recognized who I was and treated me generously.
00:27:28.810,00:27:31.270,那一日我趁他不备抢了马赶出来,00:27:29.910,00:27:32.627,One day I stole his horse and escaped.
00:27:31.900,00:27:32.810,我怕你担心,,,
00:27:33.730,00:27:34.690,日夜兼程赶回来,00:27:33.000,00:27:34.288,I didn't want you to worry about me.
00:27:35.070,00:27:36.100,就是为了见你和额娘,00:27:34.830,00:27:37.241,I rode day and night so I could see you and Mother sooner.
00:27:41.240,00:27:41.980,允礼,00:27:42.340,00:27:43.246,Yunli...
00:27:54.040,00:27:54.750,嬛儿,00:27:55.140,00:27:56.016,"Huaner,"
00:27:56.550,00:27:57.710,现在还来得及,00:27:57.650,00:27:58.934,it's not too late.
00:27:59.590,00:28:00.330,我们走吧,00:28:00.690,00:28:01.844,Come away with me.
00:28:01.470,00:28:03.300,我可以不要这天沟贵胄的身份,00:28:02.570,00:28:04.400,"I can abandon my wealth and imperial identity,"
00:28:03.760,00:28:05.090,我们去做一对布衣夫妻,00:28:04.860,00:28:06.190,and as commoners we can live as husband and wife.
00:28:06.810,00:28:07.760,你肚子里的孩子,,,
00:28:08.810,00:28:10.470,我会待他像亲生孩子一样,00:28:07.910,00:28:09.457,The child in your belly...
00:28:10.770,00:28:11.760,来不及了,00:28:09.830,00:28:11.751,I'll treat him just like my own.
00:28:13.900,00:28:14.730,允礼,00:28:11.800,00:28:13.108,It is too late.
00:28:16.150,00:28:17.010,人在世上,00:28:15.000,00:28:16.078,"Yunli,"
00:28:18.980,00:28:20.440,并非唯有一个情字,00:28:17.250,00:28:21.600,"in this world, we can't live for our love alone."
00:28:21.900,00:28:22.770,圣旨已下,00:28:23.000,00:28:24.449,The imperial decree has been delivered.
00:28:24.530,00:28:25.610,你我若一走,00:28:25.630,00:28:26.880,"If we left together,"
00:28:26.200,00:28:28.110,我们身边所有的人都会被牵连,00:28:27.300,00:28:29.417,everyone around us would be implicated.
00:28:29.490,00:28:30.480,我们不可以自私到,,,
00:28:30.790,00:28:32.320,牺牲他们来成全我们,00:28:30.590,00:28:31.890,We can't be so selfish
00:28:33.120,00:28:33.910,我做不到,00:28:31.890,00:28:33.792,and sacrifice them for our own sake.
00:28:34.630,00:28:35.540,你也做不到,00:28:34.220,00:28:35.217,I can't do that.
,,,00:28:35.730,00:28:36.800,Neither can you.
00:28:39.250,00:28:40.460,我若可以跟你走,00:28:40.350,00:28:42.015,"If it were possible to go with you,"
00:28:42.760,00:28:44.710,我何尝不愿抛下一切就跟你走,00:28:43.860,00:28:45.810,I would gladly leave everything behind.
00:28:46.470,00:28:47.800,可是你我任性一走,00:28:47.570,00:28:49.232,But if we acted so willfully，
00:28:48.510,00:28:50.800,却将父母族人的性命置于何地,00:28:49.610,00:28:52.148,"you know what would happen
to the lives of our parents and clans!"
00:28:51.270,00:28:52.970,受灭顶之灾的就是他们,00:28:52.370,00:28:54.820,Calamities would drown them like a sweeping flood!
00:28:54.850,00:28:55.720,天下之大,,,
00:28:57.060,00:28:58.020,容不下一个允礼,00:28:55.950,00:28:57.275,"In all the vastness under Heaven,"
00:28:58.400,00:28:59.390,容不下一个甄嬛,00:28:58.160,00:29:00.320,there is not a place for Yunli and Zhen Huan.
00:29:02.030,00:29:03.360,我们没有选择了,00:29:03.130,00:29:04.708,We don't have other choices.
00:29:06.030,00:29:06.690,嬛儿,00:29:07.130,00:29:08.163,"Huan'er,"
00:29:09.080,00:29:10.360,你如果从一开始,00:29:10.180,00:29:12.329,If you ... the other day ...
00:29:11.620,00:29:13.580,从一开始就对我说无情的话,00:29:12.720,00:29:14.928,"when you spoke such ruthless words to me,"
00:29:15.750,00:29:16.780,我不会相信,00:29:16.850,00:29:18.560,I didn't believe you.
00:29:19.340,00:29:20.620,可是今天这番话,00:29:20.440,00:29:22.080,"But through your words today,"
00:29:22.380,00:29:23.250,你让我明白,00:29:23.480,00:29:24.764,you made me realize that
00:29:25.800,00:29:27.380,你再也不会在我的身边了,00:29:26.900,00:29:28.935,you won't be by my side anymore.
00:29:30.680,00:29:31.840,你我一别四月,00:29:31.780,00:29:33.230,"We were separated for four months,"
00:29:33.100,00:29:34.840,早已是沧海桑田,00:29:34.200,00:29:37.120,"and things changed ""like the blue sea turned into mulberry fields."""
00:29:45.360,00:29:48.320,嬛儿让我再抱抱你好不好,00:29:46.460,00:29:49.420,"Huan'er, can I hold you one more time..."
00:29:49.950,00:29:51.110,只消一刻就好,00:29:51.050,00:29:52.417,for just a moment?
00:29:53.120,00:29:53.980,从今以后,00:29:54.220,00:29:55.370,"From today,"
00:29:55.580,00:29:57.290,我可以抱天下所有的人,00:29:56.680,00:29:58.597,"I could hold anyone else in the world,"
00:29:58.880,00:30:00.080,我再也不能把你,00:30:00.335,00:30:01.589,but I'll never
00:30:02.340,00:30:03.420,搂在我怀里了,00:30:03.617,00:30:04.996,have you in my arms again.
00:30:18.400,00:30:19.230,允礼,00:30:19.500,00:30:20.454,"Yunli,"
00:30:21.860,00:30:24.020,和你在一起就像做了一场梦,00:30:22.960,00:30:25.368,being with you is a beautiful dream I dreamt.
00:30:26.070,00:30:28.980,我多么希望这场梦永远都不要醒,00:30:27.170,00:30:30.328,How I wish I could never wake from this dream.
00:30:30.950,00:30:32.780,我这一生最快乐的日子,,,
00:30:32.870,00:30:34.360,都在这个梦里,00:30:32.050,00:30:35.163,All the happiest days of my life are in this dream.
00:30:36.000,00:30:37.280,是你给我的,00:30:37.100,00:30:38.463,You gave them to me.
00:30:40.210,00:30:43.540,方令我又何尝不是,00:30:41.310,00:30:42.765,For me ...
00:30:46.260,00:30:47.120,好了嬛儿,00:30:43.676,00:30:45.261,Isn’t it the same?
00:30:48.220,00:30:49.130,有你这句话,00:30:47.360,00:30:48.468,"All right, Huan’er."
,,,00:30:49.320,00:30:50.562,Hearing this from you...
00:30:51.430,00:30:52.630,我当不负此生,00:30:52.530,00:30:54.309,I will have no regrets in this life.
00:30:56.560,00:30:58.510,去找一个真心对你好的女子,00:30:57.660,00:31:00.000,Find a girl who treats you with a true heart
00:31:00.350,00:31:02.940,和她相扶相持白首到老,00:31:01.450,00:31:04.330,"and support each other, and grow old and gray together."
00:31:05.110,00:31:06.390,你们会过得很好,00:31:06.210,00:31:07.987,You will have a very good life together.
00:31:09.320,00:31:10.730,会一辈子幸福,,,

00:31:13.450,00:31:14.780,是要来刺我的心吗,00:31:12.630,00:31:14.079,Are you saying this...
,,,00:31:14.550,00:31:16.211,to try and pierce my heart?
00:31:17.540,00:31:18.620,我所有的一切,00:31:18.640,00:31:20.331,All I've ever possessed
00:31:20.080,00:31:22.320,就在那张合婚庚帖里说尽了,00:31:21.180,00:31:23.420,was written in our marital horoscope.
00:31:25.920,00:31:26.960,只有你,00:31:27.020,00:31:28.527,You are my everything.
00:31:28.970,00:31:30.420,再也不会有别人了,00:31:30.070,00:31:31.686,There will be no one else.
00:31:50.780,00:31:52.690,皇上果郡王回来了,00:31:51.880,00:31:53.955,"Your Majesty, Nobel Prince Guo has returned."
00:31:54.530,00:31:55.490,给皇兄请安了,,,
00:31:56.280,00:31:57.150,快起来快起来,00:31:55.630,00:31:56.838,Peace to Your Majesty.
,,,00:31:57.380,00:31:58.540,Rise immediately.
00:32:01.580,00:32:02.200,坐,00:32:02.680,00:32:03.631,Take a seat.
00:32:07.750,00:32:08.460,回来就好,00:32:08.850,00:32:10.251,All is good now that you are back.
00:32:10.800,00:32:11.580,回来就好,00:32:11.900,00:32:12.763,Very good.
00:32:12.800,00:32:14.760,朕听说你葬身黄河,00:32:13.900,00:32:16.191,"When I heard that you died in the Yellow River,"
00:32:15.680,00:32:17.290,实在是伤心得不行,00:32:16.780,00:32:18.390,it saddened me extremely.
00:32:18.850,00:32:20.890,皇额娘卧病在床,00:32:19.950,00:32:21.990,Imperial Mother has been ill in bed.
00:32:22.060,00:32:23.390,也是日夜不安,00:32:23.160,00:32:24.945,This also kept her unsettled day and night.
00:32:25.020,00:32:28.560,你能回来真是天佑我大清啊,00:32:26.120,00:32:29.660,Your return is Heaven's blessing on the Great Qing.
00:32:30.150,00:32:31.110,是皇兄的庇佑,,,
00:32:31.860,00:32:33.770,臣弟才检回了一条命,00:32:31.250,00:32:32.960,It is a blessing from Your Majesty
00:32:35.030,00:32:36.190,你回来得正是时候,00:32:32.960,00:32:34.870,that Heaven allowed me to retrieve my life.
00:32:37.950,00:32:39.240,朕有一件喜事,00:32:36.130,00:32:37.580,You came back just at the right time.
00:32:40.200,00:32:41.490,正不知道找谁去办,00:32:39.050,00:32:40.464,"I have a happy event,"
00:32:41.790,00:32:42.450,皇兄盼咐,00:32:41.300,00:32:42.890,but I didn’t know who should help me.
,,,00:32:42.890,00:32:44.295,I obey Your Majesty's command.
00:32:43.960,00:32:46.570,朕要迎熹妃回宫,00:32:45.060,00:32:48.001,I am going to have Consort Lumière return to the palace.
00:32:48.090,00:32:49.750,就是从前的莞嫔,00:32:49.190,00:32:51.264,She used to hold the title Consort Sourire.
00:32:51.840,00:32:54.460,旁人听到这个事都急着反驳朕,00:32:52.940,00:32:55.560,Others were in a hurry to refute me when they heard this.
00:32:54.970,00:32:55.830,你倒很镇定,00:32:56.070,00:32:57.261,You seem quite composed.
00:32:57.720,00:33:00.630,皇上皇上接心爱的人回宫,00:32:58.820,00:33:01.937,Your ... Your Majesty bringing your beloved back to the palace...
00:33:01.480,00:33:02.510,也是情理之中嘛,00:33:02.580,00:33:03.776,is reasonable.
00:33:03.230,00:33:05.180,何况臣弟也听说,00:33:04.330,00:33:06.404,"Besides, I also heard that"
00:33:06.690,00:33:07.930,熹妃已有身孕,00:33:07.790,00:33:09.320,Consort Lumière is pregnant.
00:33:08.570,00:33:09.930,你的消息倒很灵通,00:33:09.670,00:33:11.360,You sure have good sources!
00:33:12.650,00:33:15.440,熹妃是废妃回宫,00:33:13.750,00:33:16.540,Consort Lumière was a banished consort.
00:33:16.530,00:33:18.770,外头议论很多,00:33:17.630,00:33:19.870,There is a lot of gossip outside.
00:33:19.330,00:33:21.780,朕打算找个有身份有地位的人,00:33:20.430,00:33:22.880,I require someone of high status
00:33:22.120,00:33:24.080,为册封使迎熹妃回宫,00:33:23.220,00:33:25.263,to act as ceremonial envoy and escort her back to the palace.
00:33:25.080,00:33:27.950,可是几个年长的亲王都避嫌推辞,00:33:26.180,00:33:29.050,But all the elder state princes have declined.
00:33:28.670,00:33:29.950,朕只能找你,00:33:29.770,00:33:31.174,I can only ask you.
00:33:31.460,00:33:34.420,是否臣弟为册封使 可添熹妃荣光,00:33:32.560,00:33:35.520,"Would it bring more honor to Consort Lumière
if I were the envoy?"
00:33:35.720,00:33:38.830,若非如此朕也不会找你呀,00:33:36.820,00:33:39.930,"If not, I wouldn't ask you."
00:33:42.470,00:33:45.140,臣弟心里有数了只要是为,00:33:43.570,00:33:45.247,I understand the matter.
,,,00:33:45.247,00:33:46.720,As long as it's for ...
00:33:48.150,00:33:50.980,皇兄臣弟愿意前往,00:33:49.250,00:33:52.080,"Your Majesty, I am willing to be the envoy."
00:33:53.030,00:33:54.560,不愧是朕的好兄弟,00:33:54.130,00:33:55.743,You are truly my good brother.
00:33:55.320,00:33:56.230,那么明日,00:33:56.420,00:33:57.537,Then tomorrow
00:33:57.110,00:33:59.570,你就用半副皇后的仪仗,00:33:58.210,00:34:00.670,you will go with a unit half the size of the Empress's honor guards
00:34:00.030,00:34:01.110,迎甄氏回宫,00:34:01.130,00:34:02.499,to welcome Zhen back to the palace.
00:34:04.540,00:34:06.650,臣弟遵旨,00:34:05.640,00:34:07.750,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:34:07.210,00:34:07.950,臣妾听说,,,
00:34:08.250,00:34:09.740,皇上要用半副皇后仪仗,00:34:08.097,00:34:10.980,I heard His Majesty is sending a unit half the size of Your Majesty's honor guards
00:34:10.170,00:34:10.950,接甄氏回宫,00:34:11.203,00:34:12.646,to bring Zhen back to the palace.
00:34:12.090,00:34:14.250,她已经是钮佑禄氏了,00:34:13.190,00:34:15.350,She is already named Niohuru.
00:34:14.970,00:34:16.880,皇上为了掩人口舌,00:34:16.070,00:34:17.980,"His Majesty, to avoid gossip,"
00:34:17.510,00:34:21.220,给她台了镶黄旗赐钮佑禄大姓,00:34:18.610,00:34:22.444,"has raised her to the Bordered Yellow Banner
and conferred the distinguished surname Niohuru."
00:34:21.680,00:34:24.010,还称作是四阿哥的生母,00:34:22.780,00:34:25.110,"He also states she is the mother of the Fourth Prince,"
00:34:24.680,00:34:27.170,一直在甘露寺为国祈福,00:34:25.780,00:34:28.706,"and explains her absence as praying
for the nation at the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:34:27.940,00:34:29.550,凭空多了个儿子,00:34:29.040,00:34:30.899,She gets a son out of nowhere
00:34:30.150,00:34:31.810,还入了上三旗,00:34:31.250,00:34:32.910,and even got into the upper three banners.
00:34:33.070,00:34:35.900,如今她的永寿宫也是无尽奢华,00:34:34.170,00:34:37.331,"Now her Palace of Eternal Longevity has been
appointed with inexhaustible luxury."
00:34:36.400,00:34:37.640,令人瞠目啊,,,
00:34:38.450,00:34:39.900,可四阿哥都那么大了,00:34:37.500,00:34:39.279,One could only stare at it astonished.
00:34:40.240,00:34:41.320,他们怎么做母子啊,00:34:39.550,00:34:41.340,But the Fourth Prince is close to her age.
,,,00:34:41.340,00:34:42.875,How could they become mother and son?
00:34:42.450,00:34:44.990,皇上连儿子都可以充作她的,00:34:43.550,00:34:46.214,"If His Majesty can claim she has a son,"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.100,00:44:03.100,"My wish ran against my will.
