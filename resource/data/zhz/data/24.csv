00:02:24.240,00:02:27.950,宝鹃 你说是谁要倒大霉了,00:02:24.400,00:02:29.160,"Coua, who do you think is going to be found out?"
00:02:28.600,00:02:30.350,谁害惠贵人就是谁呗,00:02:29.580,00:02:31.880,It must be the one who victimized Lady Vertu.
00:02:31.920,00:02:34.470,只可惜华妃她自己还不知道呢,00:02:31.920,00:02:35.500,It's a pity that Consort Fleur is still unaware.
00:02:35.720,00:02:36.830,不过夜长梦多,,,
00:02:37.480,00:02:38.750,说不定过上一夜,00:02:36.160,00:02:38.420,"""One may have more dreams over a long night."""
00:02:39.120,00:02:40.230,皇上就不生气了,00:02:38.420,00:02:41.420,Maybe His Majesty's anger will dissipate by the morning.
00:02:41.880,00:02:44.270,你说她若是知道了会怎样,00:02:43.180,00:02:45.500,What do you think she'll do when she finds out what happened?
00:02:44.720,00:02:45.790,按华妃的性子,,,
00:02:46.200,00:02:47.510,要不是找年大将军,00:02:45.800,00:02:47.260,You know her.
00:02:48.040,00:02:49.670,要不就是即刻杀了刘畚,00:02:47.380,00:02:49.280,"She will either go to Great General Nian,"
00:02:50.400,00:02:52.270,然后到皇上面前哭诉求情,00:02:49.380,00:02:53.400,or kill Liu Ben immediately and then cry for His majesty's mercy.
00:02:53.160,00:02:55.630,是啊 她只要一闹,,,
00:02:56.040,00:02:57.430,皇上想不生气都难,00:02:54.440,00:02:58.460,"True, if she finds out tonight she will create chaos, and infuriate His Majesty."
00:02:58.400,00:03:00.190,刚才经过翊坤宫的时候,,,
00:03:00.480,00:03:02.510,里头可还是安安静静的吧,00:02:59.480,00:03:01.640,"When we passed the Palace of Earthly Honor,"
00:03:02.920,00:03:03.830,是还安静的,00:03:01.660,00:03:03.600,"it was very quiet, wasn't it?"
00:03:04.560,00:03:06.350,不过以前宫里她说了算,00:03:03.860,00:03:05.240,"Yes, it was."
00:03:06.960,00:03:08.510,现在让不让她安静,00:03:05.740,00:03:07.860,She is used to controlling the harem.
00:03:10.160,00:03:11.390,小主说了算,00:03:08.100,00:03:10.580,"But now, My Lady ..."
00:03:12.240,00:03:13.030,那还不快去,00:03:10.920,00:03:12.980,It is you who controls when she finds out  ...
00:03:13.520,00:03:14.190,翊坤宫,00:03:13.380,00:03:14.540,Go quickly then.
00:03:18.040,00:03:18.710,娘娘,00:03:14.660,00:03:16.540,To the Palace of Earthly Honor?
00:03:19.000,00:03:21.230,您在太医院就一直找医书查药性,00:03:19.260,00:03:22.340,"Your Highness looked through the
medical books all day at the Imperial Infirmary."
00:03:21.720,00:03:22.630,回来还要看,,,
00:03:23.080,00:03:24.310,如今这都快一更了,00:03:22.340,00:03:23.940,And you haven't stop reading since you came back.
00:03:25.120,00:03:26.870,娘娘 您还是先歇息吧,00:03:23.960,00:03:27.960,It's getting late now. Your Highness should take a break.
00:03:27.360,00:03:29.270,您看您哪 眼睛都熬红了,00:03:28.460,00:03:30.900,Your eyes are red and tired.
00:03:30.240,00:03:31.430,你说那么多废话,,,
00:03:31.840,00:03:33.070,就再去找几支蜡烛来,00:03:31.460,00:03:33.100,Why do you have so much time to talk?
00:03:34.280,00:03:34.950,是,00:03:33.160,00:03:34.460,Go get a few more candles.
,,,00:03:35.500,00:03:36.620,Yes.
00:03:36.840,00:03:39.070,娘娘坏了 刘畚找回来啦,00:03:36.840,00:03:40.180,"Your Majesty, terrible news... Liu Ben has been arrested."
00:03:40.200,00:03:41.990,什么刘畚找到了,,,
00:03:42.680,00:03:44.390,谁找到的 在哪儿呢,00:03:41.460,00:03:43.620,What? Liu Ben was caught?
00:03:44.840,00:03:45.750,奴才一概不知,00:03:43.960,00:03:45.820,By whom? And where is he now?
00:03:46.000,00:03:47.510,奴才是早见安常在身边的宫女,00:03:46.000,00:03:47.260,I have no idea.
00:03:47.880,00:03:48.830,和咱们宫的小丫头说话时,00:03:47.260,00:03:50.660,"I just heard Attendant An's maid
talking to one of our maids about it."
00:03:49.200,00:03:49.950,才知道的,,,
00:03:50.320,00:03:54.910,安常在那必是甄嬛做的,00:03:51.740,00:03:53.780,Attendant An?
00:03:56.560,00:03:57.830,一帮废物,00:03:54.540,00:03:56.620,So it was Zhen Huan.
00:03:59.040,00:04:00.550,连个手无缚鸡之力的太医,00:03:58.460,00:04:02.460,"Could the assassins have been more useless?
Liu Ben is just a weak doctor."
00:04:00.800,00:04:01.670,都除不掉,,,
00:04:02.520,00:04:05.230,娘娘少安毋躁 刘畚既已找回来,00:04:03.800,00:04:05.060,Your Highness must stay calm.
00:04:05.520,00:04:07.030,他定会供出惠贵人之事,00:04:05.060,00:04:08.020,"Since Liu Ben has been arrested
he must confessed."
00:04:07.600,00:04:08.630,娘娘与其生气,,,
00:04:08.920,00:04:11.230,不如静下心来好好想想对策,00:04:08.780,00:04:12.740,"Instead of being angry, Your Highness
needs to calm down and think of a plan."
00:04:13.400,00:04:15.790,快 快去告诉哥哥,00:04:14.920,00:04:17.040,Go! Go tell my brother ...
00:04:16.120,00:04:19.630,娘娘这个时候宫门已经下锁了,00:04:17.220,00:04:20.440,"Your Highness, the palace gates have already been locked."
00:04:20.520,00:04:21.550,皇上若是震怒,,,
00:04:21.920,00:04:23.230,即使年大将军来了,00:04:21.860,00:04:23.420,"If His Majesty is enraged,"
00:04:23.560,00:04:25.350,怕也不好干涉皇上的家事,00:04:23.480,00:04:26.720,even the Great General can't interfere with His Majesty's harem.
00:04:27.760,00:04:28.670,那怎么办,,,
00:04:29.480,00:04:30.990,本宫总不能坐以待毙吧,00:04:28.980,00:04:30.740,What should I do?
,,,00:04:30.940,00:04:32.800,I can't just sit around here.
00:04:32.800,00:04:34.150,都是一条船上的人,00:04:34.000,00:04:35.740,We are all in the same boat.
00:04:35.600,00:04:39.270,江家两兄弟也不能独善其身,00:04:35.740,00:04:40.200,The two brothers from the Jiang family can't escape this.
00:04:39.840,00:04:40.270,周宁海,,,
00:04:40.520,00:04:40.870,嗻,,,
00:04:41.200,00:04:41.910,去叫他们两兄弟把嘴,00:04:41.140,00:04:42.760,"-Zhou Ninghai.
-Yes."
00:04:42.320,00:04:43.310,给本宫闭严实了,00:04:42.760,00:04:44.740,Tell them to keep their mouths shut.
00:04:45.000,00:04:48.350,一早就去禀报皇上说本宫病重,00:04:46.300,00:04:49.820,"Go tell His Majesty in the early morning
 that I am gravely ill."
00:04:50.120,00:04:51.270,要是本宫病着,,,
00:04:51.920,00:04:54.430,念皇上也舍不得加以重罚,00:04:51.500,00:04:55.200,I can only hope that will make His Majesty more lenient.
00:04:55.160,00:04:57.110,奴才明白了 奴才马上去办,00:04:56.360,00:04:59.060,I understand. I will go right away.
00:05:00.840,00:05:02.230,娘娘要堵住他二人之口,,,
00:05:02.440,00:05:03.150,自然不错,00:05:00.840,00:05:04.480,It's necessary to keep the two doctors quiet.
00:05:03.640,00:05:06.110,可是若要想皇上回心转意,00:05:04.820,00:05:06.580,"But if Your Highness wants His Majesty to relent,"
00:05:06.520,00:05:08.750,不能只靠皇上念及旧情而心软,00:05:06.580,00:05:09.820,your long mutual affection is not enough.
00:05:09.320,00:05:11.630,更要给皇上他此刻最想要的东西,00:05:10.320,00:05:13.460,Your Highness must give him what he wants the most now.
00:05:13.880,00:05:15.870,皇上要罚娘娘,,,
00:05:16.240,00:05:19.070,自然是因为娘娘有罪 有罪当罚,00:05:14.880,00:05:19.020,"His Majesty will punish Your Highness
because Your Highness made a mistake."
00:05:19.760,00:05:21.270,有功便当赏,00:05:19.500,00:05:22.240,"A mistake deserves punishment, but a feat deserves reward."
00:05:22.120,00:05:24.230,娘娘此刻若能立下一件大功,,,
00:05:24.600,00:05:27.790,将功赎罪 皇上有了台阶下,00:05:23.320,00:05:27.000,"If Your Highness can atone for the mistake by performing a great feat,"
00:05:28.360,00:05:30.030,也能替娘娘堵住悠悠之口,00:05:27.020,00:05:31.580,"His Majesty will have a reason
to also prevent gossip about Your Highness."
00:05:37.120,00:05:39.270,有罪当罚 不可轻恕,00:05:38.420,00:05:40.820,I won't unfairly forgive a crime.
00:05:41.040,00:05:42.990,等一下就去翊坤宫传旨,00:05:42.200,00:05:44.460,Go announce my decree to the Palace of Earthly Honor.
00:05:44.520,00:05:46.190,嗻 奴才这就去,00:05:44.960,00:05:47.240,"Yes, I'll do it now."
00:05:47.560,00:05:50.670,每日上朝都为时疫之事烦心不已,00:05:48.700,00:05:51.420,Every day I am consumed with worry about the plague at court.
00:05:51.200,00:05:52.630,不知道什么时候才是个头,00:05:52.120,00:05:53.800,I don't know if it will ever end.
00:05:53.360,00:05:55.230,强者劳力智者劳心,00:05:54.400,00:05:57.140,"""The strong work with their arms,
while the wise exert their minds."""
00:05:56.120,00:05:58.750,皇上劳心又劳力 自然格外辛苦,00:05:57.320,00:06:00.020,"Your Majesty is especially tired,
exhausting your arms and your mind."
00:05:59.240,00:06:00.390,有你这么一哄,,,
00:06:00.840,00:06:03.630,朕就是再累也不得不甘之如饴了,00:06:00.440,00:06:04.600,"Hearing you say that, I feel as if my bitter
 work is as sweet as honey."
00:06:05.120,00:06:06.870,昨晚朕的话没说好,,,
00:06:07.520,00:06:08.550,不许往心里去啊,00:06:06.360,00:06:08.520,I didn't speak properly last night.
00:06:09.680,00:06:10.470,臣妾不敢,00:06:08.840,00:06:10.280,Don't take it to heart.
,,,00:06:10.860,00:06:12.540,I dare not.
00:06:18.720,00:06:19.230,华妃娘娘吉祥,,,
00:06:19.440,00:06:20.190,起来吧,00:06:19.780,00:06:21.620,"- Peace to Your Highness.
- Rise."
00:06:21.680,00:06:22.470,皇上呢,00:06:22.780,00:06:23.820,I need to see His Majesty.
00:06:22.760,00:06:24.910,皇上正在更衣呢 这就要去早朝,00:06:23.820,00:06:26.020,His Majesty is about to leave for court.
00:06:25.240,00:06:26.590,奴才正要去翊坤宫,00:06:26.220,00:06:27.820,I was just heading for the Palace of Earthly Honor.
00:06:26.800,00:06:29.230,不必了 本宫有事求见皇上,00:06:27.820,00:06:30.340,"That may be, but I have an urgent request for an audience."
00:06:29.880,00:06:31.830,娘娘 皇上此刻,00:06:30.920,00:06:32.060,Your Highness.
00:06:32.280,00:06:33.470,大概没工夫见您了,00:06:32.060,00:06:34.480,I'm afraid His Majesty is too busy to see you.
00:06:33.960,00:06:35.710,有没有工夫见 是皇上的事,00:06:34.963,00:06:37.140,His Majesty can decide whether to see me or not.
00:06:36.120,00:06:37.550,去不去禀报是你的事,00:06:37.140,00:06:39.200,Your job is to inform him.
00:06:39.920,00:06:41.790,那就请娘娘稍候片刻,00:06:40.940,00:06:43.160,"Just a moment, Your Highness."
00:06:49.520,00:06:53.390,皇上 华妃 年嫔娘娘来了,00:06:50.560,00:06:51.880,Your Majesty...
,,,00:06:51.940,00:06:53.200,Concubine Fleur ...
00:06:53.840,00:06:54.670,要求面圣,00:06:53.220,00:06:54.660,Concubine Nian is here.
00:06:55.240,00:06:56.030,怎么回事啊,00:06:54.940,00:06:56.280,She requests an audience with Your Majesty.
00:06:56.560,00:06:58.470,年嫔娘娘带着江诚江慎,00:06:56.280,00:06:57.540,What's the matter?
00:06:58.800,00:06:59.550,两位太医来,00:06:57.620,00:07:00.540,Concubine Nian came with Dr Jiang Cheng and Dr Jiang Shen.
00:07:00.040,00:07:01.390,说是一定要见皇上,,,
00:07:01.800,00:07:02.950,似乎是有急事,00:07:01.024,00:07:03.948,"She insists on seeing Your Majesty.
It seems to be something urgent."
00:07:04.000,00:07:05.670,你对她讲朕的旨意了吗,,,
00:07:06.000,00:07:07.350,年嫔娘娘来得匆忙,00:07:05.020,00:07:06.840,Did you announce my decree?
00:07:07.800,00:07:09.070,容不了奴才回话,00:07:07.060,00:07:10.520,"Concubine Nian came in a rush,
and did not allow me to say anything."
00:07:10.560,00:07:13.190,既没有讲 就不要年嫔年嫔地叫,00:07:11.620,00:07:14.260,"If not, stop calling her ""Concubine Nian""."
00:07:14.520,00:07:16.390,你带他们先去西暖阁候着,00:07:15.600,00:07:17.620,Tell them to wait for me in the West Chamber.
00:07:16.840,00:07:17.390,嗻,00:07:18.060,00:07:19.000,Yes.
00:07:27.120,00:07:28.430,皇上驾到,00:07:28.180,00:07:29.840,His Majesty is here.
00:07:29.280,00:07:30.910,臣妾叩见皇上 微臣叩见皇上,00:07:30.320,00:07:32.220,I bow in respect before Your Majesty

- I thank Your Majesty."
00:07:40.880,00:07:42.190,什么事急着见朕,00:07:41.980,00:07:43.300,What's so urgent?
00:07:42.520,00:07:44.750,皇上大喜 臣妾早闻,00:07:43.576,00:07:45.074,I have great news for Your Majesty.
00:07:45.080,00:07:46.430,江诚江慎两位太医,,,

00:07:49.480,00:07:52.270,所以特意带两位太医来回禀皇上,00:07:50.500,00:07:53.300,I brought them here to report to Your Majesty.
00:07:53.320,00:07:53.950,真的,00:07:54.340,00:07:55.280,Really?
00:07:54.200,00:07:57.070,是啊 医道臣妾不大通,00:07:55.280,00:07:58.060,"Yes, but I am not well-versed in medicine."
00:07:57.440,00:07:59.310,还请太医向皇上回述吧,00:07:58.440,00:08:00.320,I will let them explain to Your Majesty.
00:08:03.600,00:08:06.070,风寒暑湿燥火,00:08:04.180,00:08:07.200,"The six evil Qi, ""wind, cold, summer-heat, damp, dryness, and fire"","
00:08:06.320,00:08:07.630,六邪气从口鼻而入,,,

00:08:10.400,00:08:11.310,侵犯上焦肺卫,,,
00:08:11.560,00:08:14.590,与五内肺腑相冲相克而为时疫,00:08:11.336,00:08:15.537,"They attack the Upper Burner, Lung and Stomach,
and creates turmoil in the organs."
00:08:14.960,00:08:16.470,不要掉书袋 拣要紧的讲,00:08:15.560,00:08:17.440,Don't be a pedant. Get to the point.
00:08:16.800,00:08:18.910,时疫多为饮食不洁所致,00:08:17.680,00:08:19.900,"In most cases, the plague is caused by unsanitary food,"
00:08:19.200,00:08:20.750,而使脾胃肠等受损,,,
00:08:21.400,00:08:22.990,臣等翻阅了古书医方,00:08:20.220,00:08:22.080,"which damages the Spleen, Stomach, and Intestines."
00:08:23.400,00:08:24.390,研制出一张药方,00:08:22.500,00:08:25.520,"We pored over the ancient medical books, and developed a prescription."
00:08:24.840,00:08:26.230,名时疫救急丸,,,
00:08:26.960,00:08:28.510,此药性温祛湿,00:08:25.940,00:08:27.780,We call it the Plague Emergency Relief Formula.
00:08:28.840,00:08:30.470,温肝补肾调养元气,00:08:28.000,00:08:31.480,"It's warm nature dispels damp, and tonicifies Liver, Kidney, and innate qi."
00:08:31.080,00:08:32.910,给太医院的太医们看过了,,,
00:08:33.240,00:08:34.030,觉得可行吗,00:08:32.180,00:08:35.100,"Has it been examined by all the imperial doctors?
Is it effective?"
00:08:34.400,00:08:35.030,是,,,
00:08:35.280,00:08:37.470,已给几个小太监吃过药了,00:08:35.620,00:08:36.480,It has.
00:08:38.000,00:08:40.190,两剂药后有退烧的迹象,00:08:36.540,00:08:41.580,"Two eunuchs already took the formula,
and their fever broke after two doses."
00:08:41.600,00:08:44.470,好好,00:08:42.660,00:08:43.980,Good.
,,,00:08:45.520,00:08:46.760,Good.
00:08:48.520,00:08:49.270,娘娘,00:08:49.340,00:08:50.880,Your Highness.
00:08:51.600,00:08:53.990,皇上恕罪 臣妾失仪了,00:08:52.660,00:08:55.060,I beg Your Majesty's pardon.
00:08:54.880,00:08:57.230,是哪里不舒服吗 赶紧坐下,00:08:55.900,00:08:58.380,Are you feeling unwell? Take a seat.
00:08:57.640,00:08:58.510,谢皇上,,,
00:08:58.760,00:08:59.990,娘娘早微臣等说起,00:08:58.560,00:08:59.720,I thank Your Majesty.
00:09:00.280,00:09:02.150,古书中或许有治疗时疫的方子,00:08:59.720,00:09:03.180,"When Her Highness heard that the remedy
might be found in old medical books,"
00:09:02.480,00:09:04.110,昨天一夜未睡查找典籍,,,
00:09:04.760,00:09:06.230,前几日也是熬到深夜,00:09:03.620,00:09:05.520,she stayed up all night going through the books.
00:09:06.920,00:09:08.870,想是因此而身子发虚,00:09:05.840,00:09:10.200,"Her Highness is also feeling weak because she
stayed up until early morning the last few days."
00:09:10.280,00:09:13.110,臣妾自知愚钝 不堪服侍皇上,00:09:11.300,00:09:14.140,I know I am unworthy of serving Your Majesty
00:09:13.480,00:09:14.710,只会惹皇上生气,,,
00:09:15.520,00:09:17.030,所以才会想尽办法,00:09:14.420,00:09:16.280,and always make Your Majesty angry.
00:09:18.080,00:09:19.750,只希望替皇上解忧,00:09:16.600,00:09:20.900,But I would do anything to ease Your Majesty's burdens.
00:09:21.400,00:09:22.510,爱妃辛苦了,00:09:22.480,00:09:24.220,My beloved Consort has worked tirelessly.
00:09:25.320,00:09:25.830,苏培盛,,,
00:09:26.520,00:09:27.190,奴才在,00:09:26.580,00:09:28.420,"- Su Peisheng.
- Your Majesty."
00:09:27.400,00:09:29.670,你带几个人赶快跟江太医去,00:09:28.420,00:09:30.680,Take some servants and go with Dr Jiang.
00:09:30.560,00:09:32.710,先把药送到惠贵人的存菊堂,00:09:31.638,00:09:33.788,Deliver the herbs immediately to Lady Vertu.
00:09:33.560,00:09:36.070,然后遍发宫中感染时疫的宫人,00:09:34.623,00:09:37.133,And then distribute it to everyone else infected.
00:09:36.440,00:09:37.030,嗻,00:09:37.560,00:09:38.620,Yes.
00:09:47.080,00:09:47.950,惠贵人,00:09:48.100,00:09:49.160,Lady Vertu?
,,,00:09:49.300,00:09:50.260,Yes.
00:09:49.640,00:09:52.510,朕已经复了沈氏的位分,00:09:50.700,00:09:53.620,I have restored Companion Shen's title
00:09:54.240,00:09:56.470,以前的事都是朕错怪她了,00:09:55.280,00:09:58.440,of which she was wrongfully deprived.
00:09:58.760,00:10:00.590,那还真是委屈了沈家妹妹,00:09:59.820,00:10:01.660,Shen must have suffered a lot.
00:10:01.720,00:10:03.670,皇上是该好好补偿才是,00:10:02.800,00:10:04.940,She deserves compensation from Your Majesty.
00:10:06.200,00:10:07.470,莞贵人大喜呀,00:10:07.220,00:10:08.980,"Such happy news, Lady Sourire!"
00:10:07.920,00:10:10.630,你们姐妹一场也总算可以放心了,00:10:09.000,00:10:11.720,You and your sister don't need to worry anymore.
00:10:13.680,00:10:14.870,多谢华妃娘娘,00:10:14.760,00:10:16.560,I thank Your Highness.
00:10:17.680,00:10:20.830,臣妾不求皇上原谅臣妾昔日鲁莽,00:10:18.600,00:10:21.720,"I dare not ask for Your Majesty's forgiveness
of my impetuous mistakes in the past."
00:10:21.200,00:10:23.230,只求皇上不要因为生臣妾的气,,,
00:10:23.960,00:10:25.390,而伤了皇上的龙体,00:10:22.180,00:10:26.420,"I wish only that Your Majesty's good health
has not been harmed by the anger I have caused."
00:10:26.760,00:10:28.390,臣妾原是草芥之人,00:10:27.380,00:10:30.040,"I am a humble commoner like ""the roadside grass"""
00:10:28.920,00:10:31.910,可皇上的身子是天下万民的,00:10:30.040,00:10:32.900,while Your Majesty's health is critical to everyone under Heaven.
00:10:32.360,00:10:37.230,好了 今日之事你确是立了大功,00:10:33.300,00:10:35.140,All right.
,,,00:10:35.460,00:10:38.200,You have made a great contribution to the country today.
00:10:38.320,00:10:40.590,若此方真能治愈时疫,00:10:39.520,00:10:42.420,"If the medicine can cure the plague,"
00:10:41.760,00:10:43.430,那就是天下人之福了,00:10:42.940,00:10:45.040,then everyone under Heaven will benefit.
00:10:44.200,00:10:47.110,朕不是赏罚不明之人,00:10:45.340,00:10:48.340,My decision about awards and punishments will be fair.
00:10:49.440,00:10:50.670,皇上圣明,00:10:50.880,00:10:52.880,I thank Your Majesty.
00:11:05.160,00:11:08.230,小主小主,00:11:06.100,00:11:08.820,My Lady....
00:11:09.880,00:11:11.670,皇上要处置两位江太医,00:11:08.820,00:11:10.600,My Lady.
00:11:12.080,00:11:13.510,和华妃娘娘的旨意,00:11:10.920,00:11:16.360,"Do I still need to deliver His Majesty's
decree on Consort Fleur and the two doctors?"
00:11:14.160,00:11:15.550,奴才还要不要传哪,,,
00:11:17.360,00:11:19.790,这话本该是奴才去问皇上的,00:11:18.300,00:11:20.700,I know I should be asking His Majesty...
00:11:20.160,00:11:21.070,可您瞧这里边,00:11:20.900,00:11:22.980,"But since you were there, My Lady,"
00:11:22.480,00:11:24.390,还请小主可怜一下奴才,00:11:23.400,00:11:25.900,I humbly seek your guidance.
00:11:26.440,00:11:30.110,看这情形是不用你再跑一趟了,00:11:27.680,00:11:29.460,It seems to me that ...
00:11:31.400,00:11:32.230,若再要去,00:11:29.940,00:11:31.640,"you don't have to go, sir."
00:11:34.000,00:11:35.790,也只怕是加封的旨意了,00:11:32.400,00:11:34.560,"If you end up delivering a decree,"
,,,00:11:35.000,00:11:37.760,it will be one to promote her.
00:11:51.920,00:11:54.190,温大人 江太医让奴才送来,,,
00:11:54.560,00:11:55.710,治时疫的药给惠贵人,00:11:53.180,00:11:56.520,"Dr. Wen, Dr. Jiang asked me to send you the medicine for Lady Vertu."
00:11:55.920,00:11:58.030,什么 江太医也研制出,,,
00:11:58.400,00:11:59.470,治疗时疫的药,00:11:56.900,00:12:00.300,Has Dr. Jiang found a cure for plague as well?
00:12:00.760,00:12:01.590,放这儿给我看看,00:12:02.040,00:12:03.920,I'll have a look.
00:12:21.400,00:12:23.190,皇上驾到,00:12:22.400,00:12:25.460,His Majesty the Emperor!
00:12:28.560,00:12:29.030,皇上万福金安,,,
00:12:29.280,00:12:32.430,快起来吧 在用早膳了,00:12:29.800,00:12:32.100,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Rise."
00:12:33.160,00:12:34.270,可还合胃口吗,00:12:32.400,00:12:34.280,You're having breakfast.
00:12:35.680,00:12:38.270,食不甘味也好 食髓知味也好,00:12:34.280,00:12:36.120,How's the food?
00:12:39.120,00:12:40.430,都是御膳房的手艺,00:12:37.060,00:12:40.080,"Whether it's insipid or delicious,"
00:12:40.920,00:12:41.870,臣妾不敢挑剔,00:12:40.320,00:12:41.880,it's made by the Imperial Kitchen.
00:12:43.280,00:12:43.950,坐下,00:12:41.880,00:12:43.880,I dare not be picky.
00:12:47.720,00:12:48.830,御膳房的菜式,00:12:44.560,00:12:46.540,Have a seat.
00:12:49.200,00:12:50.510,要顾及所有人的口味,00:12:49.020,00:12:51.740,The Imperial Kitchen has to prepare food for everyone.
00:12:51.200,00:12:52.990,不会因一人格外迁就,00:12:52.320,00:12:54.500,They can't make particular compromises for one person.
00:12:53.440,00:12:55.470,就如朕也要顾全大局,00:12:54.640,00:12:56.740,"Likewise, I have to consider the greater good."
00:12:56.360,00:12:58.270,是臣妾明白,00:12:57.620,00:12:59.620,"Yes, I understand."
00:12:58.960,00:13:00.430,眼下时疫那么厉害,00:13:00.140,00:13:02.040,The plague has been rampant.
00:13:01.400,00:13:04.230,华妃和江太医悉心制出药方,00:13:02.580,00:13:05.620,Consort Fleur and Dr. Jiang exerted themselves pursuing the remedy.
00:13:04.840,00:13:06.350,也算是将功抵过,00:13:05.940,00:13:07.840,Her hard work makes up for her mistake.
00:13:07.160,00:13:09.550,至于刘畚 朕已经赐死,00:13:08.180,00:13:10.580,"As for Liu Ben, I have granted him suicide."
00:13:10.280,00:13:12.750,也算是解了惠贵人一点冤屈,00:13:11.440,00:13:14.200,"This will, to an extent, compensate Lady Vertu."
00:13:13.320,00:13:16.670,陷害姐姐 刘畚不是主谋,00:13:14.300,00:13:17.600,Liu Ben is not the culprit behind this.
00:13:18.560,00:13:23.230,朕知道眼下用人之际没有办法,00:13:19.720,00:13:21.340,I understand.
,,,00:13:22.340,00:13:25.000,But I need their assistance right now.
00:13:24.200,00:13:26.430,惠贵人的事 朕没有忘记,00:13:25.340,00:13:27.500,I have not forgotten what Lady Vertu suffered.
00:13:26.880,00:13:28.190,也不会轻易放过,00:13:28.060,00:13:30.300,Nor will I let them off easy.
00:13:31.080,00:13:32.750,皇上龙体安康要紧,00:13:32.440,00:13:34.340,Your Majesty's health takes priority.
00:13:33.480,00:13:35.070,臣妾没有什么不放心的,00:13:34.580,00:13:36.560,There's nothing else that concerns me.
00:13:35.480,00:13:38.430,那就好 只是这些日子,00:13:36.560,00:13:38.240,That's good.
00:13:38.840,00:13:40.350,朕恐怕会冷落你些,00:13:38.540,00:13:41.400,"I also hope you can understand
that I won't be around as much."
00:13:42.360,00:13:45.390,皇上忙于朝政 臣妾明白,00:13:43.300,00:13:46.300,I understand that Your Majesty will be busy with state affairs.
00:13:46.280,00:13:47.190,那朕先走了,00:13:47.400,00:13:49.060,I have to go now.
00:13:49.160,00:13:50.350,皇上起驾,00:13:50.200,00:13:52.420,His Majesty is leaving.
00:14:00.520,00:14:01.750,皇上眼下乌青,,,
00:14:02.680,00:14:04.870,看样子近来确实是劳累了,00:14:01.820,00:14:03.780,His Majesty has dark circles under his eyes.
00:14:05.840,00:14:07.110,皇上昨夜劳累了,00:14:03.780,00:14:06.240,He must have been working long hours.
00:14:08.920,00:14:10.550,吩咐小厨房做碗参汤,00:14:06.960,00:14:09.300,His Majesty did work very late last night.
00:14:11.680,00:14:12.630,送去养心殿,00:14:10.260,00:14:12.480,Ask my kitchen to make some ginseng soup
,,,00:14:12.760,00:14:14.980,and send it to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:14:13.920,00:14:18.270,小主 皇上也是有无奈之处的呀,00:14:15.440,00:14:20.080,"My Lady, you must understand that even
an emperor cannot do everything he wants."
00:14:20.760,00:14:25.070,后宫中女人的前程与恩宠,00:14:21.800,00:14:25.800,"In the harem, a woman's future and favor"
00:14:26.040,00:14:27.710,都在皇上的枕榻之上,00:14:27.180,00:14:29.680,all rest upon His Majesty's pillow.
00:14:29.720,00:14:31.270,皇上的大局亦是如此,00:14:30.300,00:14:32.920,But His Majesty's government also rests upon his pillow.
00:14:33.640,00:14:37.630,两情缱绻间就能消弭硝烟,00:14:34.880,00:14:38.680,Love seems unconquerable but vanishes like smoke.
00:14:39.000,00:14:39.910,也算默契,00:14:40.100,00:14:42.000,We both understand how it has to be.
00:14:41.480,00:14:43.070,这在宫中都是寻常事,00:14:42.600,00:14:44.520,That’s all too common in the palace.
00:14:43.640,00:14:44.870,小主不必太介意,00:14:44.660,00:14:46.220,"My Lady, don't take it to heart."
00:14:45.600,00:14:48.950,我不是介意 我是失望,00:14:46.420,00:14:48.200,I won't.
,,,00:14:49.220,00:14:51.140,I'm just feeling disappointed.
00:14:51.280,00:14:53.190,我从没有想过皇上会疑心我,00:14:52.540,00:14:54.980,I never thought His Majesty would cease to trust me.
00:14:55.240,00:14:57.710,皇上多疑我是知道的,00:14:56.440,00:14:59.100,I know His Majesty is a sensitive person.
00:14:59.320,00:15:01.070,尽管当日错怪眉姐姐时,,,
00:15:01.440,00:15:02.390,我也曾想过,00:15:00.820,00:15:03.740,"When His Majesty wronged Meizhuang,"
00:15:03.400,00:15:05.350,会不会有一天皇上也不信任我,00:15:03.740,00:15:06.840,I wondered whether he would distrust me one day.
00:15:07.120,00:15:11.510,可是事到如今我还是那么难过,00:15:08.320,00:15:12.440,"But now that it's happened, I'm surprised how much it saddens me."
00:15:12.920,00:15:15.790,这嫔妃之间的争斗是非,,,
00:15:16.240,00:15:17.630,都是最不重要的,00:15:13.980,00:15:18.540,Right and wrong are the least important among the concubines.
00:15:18.240,00:15:20.950,重要的是皇上愿意相信谁,00:15:19.260,00:15:22.360,What matters is who His Majesty is willing to trust.
00:15:22.360,00:15:24.790,所以小主与其在这里伤心难过,00:15:23.440,00:15:26.160,"Instead of being sad, My Lady,"
00:15:25.240,00:15:29.350,不如多想想该如何让皇上少疑心,00:15:26.420,00:15:30.700,"you have to start thinking about
how to reduce His Majesty's suspicion."
00:15:31.760,00:15:34.470,为什么不说让皇上不疑心呢,00:15:32.600,00:15:35.640,"Why don’t you say ""dispel His Majesty's suspicion""?"
00:15:36.360,00:15:37.790,小主若觉得做得到,,,
00:15:38.280,00:15:39.350,也可以这样说,00:15:37.560,00:15:39.360,"If you think you can do that, My Lady,"
,,,00:15:39.380,00:15:41.020,we can say that instead.
00:15:45.400,00:15:46.270,到底怎么了,00:15:46.640,00:15:48.340,What happened?
00:15:48.080,00:15:51.150,怎么好端端的恶心又胸闷难受,00:15:49.300,00:15:52.560,What made you suddenly feel nauseous and heavy in your chest?
00:15:52.320,00:15:53.870,不是胎象已经稳定了吗,00:15:53.440,00:15:56.320,I thought you were in good prenatal health.
00:15:57.400,00:15:59.390,回禀皇上 无妨,00:15:58.700,00:16:00.700,Your Majesty must not worry.
00:15:59.720,00:16:02.030,小主只是吃多了东西撑着了,00:16:00.700,00:16:02.600,Lady Fuca simply ate too much.
00:16:02.680,00:16:03.670,才胸闷难受,00:16:02.800,00:16:04.900,It caused her chest to feel tight.
00:16:04.080,00:16:06.390,只需晚膳用得清淡些就好了,00:16:05.000,00:16:07.580,She just needs to have a lighter meal for dinner.
00:16:07.080,00:16:09.750,你怎么连自己是撑着了,,,
00:16:10.040,00:16:11.870,还是真不舒服都分不清楚,00:16:08.440,00:16:12.500,You could not tell the difference between being too full and being ill?
00:16:12.760,00:16:14.590,那臣妾就是害怕嘛,00:16:14.000,00:16:16.260,"I was just scared, Your Majesty."
00:16:15.320,00:16:18.110,罢了你先好好躺着,00:16:16.480,00:16:19.620,"All right, you should lie down and have a good rest."
00:16:18.600,00:16:20.830,朕还有事晚上再来瞧你,00:16:19.700,00:16:21.960,I still have some work to do. I’ll come back in the evening.
00:16:21.040,00:16:21.790,皇上,00:16:21.960,00:16:23.040,Your Majesty…
00:16:22.040,00:16:26.470,好了 朕说了会来看你就会来的,00:16:23.060,00:16:24.320,I know.
00:16:29.240,00:16:30.470,皇上起驾,00:16:24.840,00:16:27.560,I said I will be here.
00:16:31.200,00:16:32.110,恭送皇上,00:16:30.360,00:16:32.020,His Majesty is leaving.
,,,00:16:32.300,00:16:33.920,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:16:41.600,00:16:45.190,好好啊,00:16:42.860,00:16:44.400,Good.
00:16:47.080,00:16:49.030,年富不负朕所托,00:16:45.800,00:16:47.520,This is great!
00:16:49.840,00:16:51.190,平了卓子山的叛乱,00:16:48.360,00:16:50.680,Nian Fu lived up to my expectation.
,,,00:16:51.060,00:16:53.280,He quelled the rebellion at Mount Zhuozi.
00:16:52.560,00:16:55.630,果然是虎父无犬子,00:16:53.820,00:16:56.800,"Like father, like son."
00:16:56.320,00:16:58.430,皇上 快午膳了,,,
00:16:59.000,00:17:01.310,您今儿个是要在养心殿用呢,00:16:57.520,00:16:59.960,"Your Majesty, it’s almost time for lunch."
00:17:01.640,00:17:03.350,还是到哪位小主的宫中用呢,00:17:00.280,00:17:04.400,"Would Your Majesty prefer to eat at the
Hall of Mental Cultivation or in the harem?"
00:17:04.080,00:17:06.830,今儿御膳房不是做了一品,,,
00:17:07.240,00:17:08.990,珍珠海米煨鹌鹑吗,00:17:05.260,00:17:09.820,Didn’t the Imperial Kitchen make braised quail rice pearls today?
00:17:09.360,00:17:10.070,是啊,,,
00:17:11.040,00:17:12.630,朕记得华妃最爱吃,00:17:10.340,00:17:11.820,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:17:13.240,00:17:14.190,就去翊坤宫吧,00:17:12.100,00:17:14.360,I remember it's Consort Fleur's favorite dish.
00:17:14.760,00:17:15.750,这份巧的,00:17:14.400,00:17:15.720,I will eat at the Palace of Earthly Honor.
00:17:16.280,00:17:18.430,翊坤宫的人才刚来请过呢,00:17:15.860,00:17:17.220,What a coincidence!
,,,00:17:17.460,00:17:19.780,"The Palace of Earthly Honor has just
sent someone to invite Your Majesty over."
00:17:19.240,00:17:21.990,看来朕与华妃是心意相通啊,00:17:20.060,00:17:23.560,We seem to share one heart and one mind.
00:17:24.920,00:17:27.150,鲍鱼烩珍珠鱼肚煨火腿,00:17:26.140,00:17:28.940,"Braised abalone with pearl eggs,
stewed ham with fish maw,"
00:17:27.760,00:17:31.270,鲨鱼皮鸡汁羹还有鲜蘑菜心,00:17:29.020,00:17:32.320,"chicken soup with shark skin,
and flowering cabbage with mushrooms."
00:17:31.880,00:17:33.910,这些都是皇上素日爱吃的,00:17:33.140,00:17:35.180,These are all Your Majesty’s favorites.
00:17:34.520,00:17:36.430,这些菜都是最费工夫的,00:17:35.600,00:17:38.300,These are the most time-consuming to make.
00:17:37.720,00:17:40.430,你一定是后半夜就起来,00:17:38.920,00:17:42.460,You must have gotten up before dawn to attend to the kitchen.
00:17:40.800,00:17:41.670,盯着他们做的吧,,,
00:17:42.480,00:17:43.670,皇上吃的东西,,,
00:17:43.960,00:17:45.470,臣妾不能不亲自看着,00:17:43.700,00:17:46.820,I must supervise the cooking of Your Majesty 's food.
00:17:46.200,00:17:48.190,吃顿饭都要你这么费心,,,
00:17:48.800,00:17:50.070,朕真是舍不得,00:17:47.440,00:17:51.280,"I feel bad that you put
so much effort into just one meal for me."
00:17:50.800,00:17:53.990,为皇上尽心尽力臣妾甘之如饴,00:17:51.980,00:17:55.900,It's my pleasure to spare no effort serving Your Majesty.
00:17:57.200,00:17:59.870,皇上批了一上午折子想必饿了,00:17:58.420,00:18:01.280,"Your Majesty must be hungry after
half a day reviewing memorandums."
00:18:00.280,00:18:01.910,喝碗鸡汁羹暖暖胃吧,00:18:01.540,00:18:03.760,Your Majesty should start with some chicken soup to warm the Stomach.
00:18:07.120,00:18:08.670,皇上今儿胃口不借,,,
00:18:09.200,00:18:10.230,可是有喜事啊,00:18:08.420,00:18:10.320,Your Majesty seems to have a good appetite today.
00:18:10.920,00:18:11.670,你猜猜,00:18:10.340,00:18:11.720,Is there any good news?
,,,00:18:12.020,00:18:13.340,Take a guess.
00:18:13.600,00:18:15.950,可是年富那孩子不负圣恩,00:18:14.900,00:18:17.260,Is it because Nian Fu fulfilled Your Majesty's grace
00:18:16.320,00:18:17.990,平定卓子山叛乱之事,00:18:17.420,00:18:19.860,by suppressing the rebels at Mount Zhuozi?
00:18:20.080,00:18:21.630,你的耳报神倒灵通,00:18:21.240,00:18:22.800,You have good sources.
00:18:22.760,00:18:23.870,这么快便知道了,,,
00:18:24.280,00:18:26.030,一大早便有捷报传进来,00:18:23.760,00:18:25.380,You were informed very promptly.
00:18:26.440,00:18:27.910,臣妾也为年富高兴,00:18:25.380,00:18:27.380,The news of victory arrived early in the morning.
00:18:29.160,00:18:31.790,年富年少有为,00:18:27.640,00:18:29.460,I am happy for Nian Fu as well.
00:18:32.480,00:18:34.990,不辜负年羹尧对他的一番教导啊,00:18:30.100,00:18:36.320,"Nian Fu did not fail his father's teachings and
 has achieved success beyond his young age."
00:18:35.800,00:18:37.550,年富这孩子初战告捷,,,
00:18:37.920,00:18:39.310,臣妾高兴了一上午,00:18:37.000,00:18:40.460,"All morning I have been happy for Nian Fu's
first military victory."
00:18:39.760,00:18:42.310,皇上以为要赏些他什么呢,00:18:40.960,00:18:43.820,How does Your Majesty intend to reward him?
00:18:42.800,00:18:43.830,你既心疼他,,,
00:18:44.760,00:18:46.990,赏些银子文房四宝也就是了,00:18:43.880,00:18:48.040,"Since you appreciate his hard work, I will reward him
silver and Four Treasures of the Study."
00:18:47.520,00:18:50.150,男孩子家的又身在战场上,00:18:48.700,00:18:51.240,He is a man of the battlefields.
00:18:50.480,00:18:51.390,不好这些,,,
00:18:51.680,00:18:53.430,那你说该赏些什么,00:18:51.280,00:18:52.560,He wouldn't care for these.
00:18:54.320,00:18:56.470,哥哥的长子年斌已经封爵,00:18:52.560,00:18:54.560,So what do your suggest?
00:18:57.200,00:18:59.310,年富这孩子虽是次子,00:18:55.500,00:18:58.320,"My brother's eldest son, Nian Bin,
has already been awarded a noble title."
00:18:59.560,00:19:01.550,但是英勇善战不输他哥哥,00:18:58.320,00:19:02.740,"Although Nian Fu is his second son,
he is as gallant as his brother."
00:19:02.120,00:19:05.230,皇上何不赏个什么爵位给他,00:19:03.480,00:19:06.400,What if Your Majesty also rewards him with a title?
00:19:05.840,00:19:06.950,也好让兄弟二人,,,
00:19:07.320,00:19:09.190,齐心协助皇上做一番事啊,00:19:06.940,00:19:10.520,So they will be of one heart in serving Your Majesty.
00:19:09.880,00:19:15.030,年富年纪还小又才刚立了战功,00:19:11.040,00:19:16.540,"Nian Fu is very young, and this is his first military achievement."
00:19:15.920,00:19:17.670,这个时候就封他爵位,,,
00:19:18.760,00:19:21.590,为时尚早 再等两年,00:19:17.220,00:19:21.060,It's too early to grant him a title.
00:19:23.240,00:19:25.830,皇上如今心疼臣妾哥哥胜过臣妾,00:19:22.040,00:19:24.540,He'll have to wait for a couple of years.
00:19:26.560,00:19:27.790,若是哥哥来说,00:19:24.580,00:19:27.020,"Your Majesty must care more about
my brother's opinion than mine."
00:19:28.320,00:19:29.710,皇上便以为哥哥是,00:19:27.620,00:19:29.320,If my brother had made this suggestion
00:19:30.040,00:19:31.950,体恤将士安抚有道,00:19:29.500,00:19:32.920,"Your Majesty would say he is acknowledging
the achievement of a warrior."
00:19:32.600,00:19:33.790,臣妾说了,00:19:33.580,00:19:35.660,"But if I make the same suggestion,"
00:19:34.680,00:19:37.110,皇上就以为臣妾是妇人之见,00:19:36.020,00:19:37.860,Your Majesty seems to think it's just a woman's short-sighted view.
00:19:37.480,00:19:40.270,你哥哥也来给年富讨赏了,00:19:38.640,00:19:41.440,Did your brother come to seek a reward for Nian Fu ?
00:19:41.280,00:19:42.950,哥哥最心疼年富了,00:19:42.460,00:19:44.700,My brother does adore Nian Fu the most.
00:19:44.160,00:19:45.550,臣妾是这么揣测的,00:19:45.020,00:19:47.080,But this is my own idea.
00:19:52.600,00:19:53.430,先吃饭,00:19:53.680,00:19:55.460,Let's eat.
00:20:08.960,00:20:11.710,好吧 好吧,00:20:10.260,00:20:11.680,All right.
,,,00:20:12.060,00:20:13.760,All right.
00:20:12.880,00:20:17.030,朕就加赏你哥哥一等男世职,00:20:14.040,00:20:17.920,I will reward your brother the first-order hereditary title
00:20:17.960,00:20:20.670,由年富承袭如何,00:20:19.200,00:20:21.200,to be passed on to Nian Fu.
,,,00:20:21.320,00:20:22.780,How's that?
00:20:23.040,00:20:27.190,皇上 皇上偏要臣妾急了,00:20:24.320,00:20:26.540,Your Majesty.
00:20:27.520,00:20:30.390,才肯答应臣妾 臣妾不依呢,00:20:26.900,00:20:30.020,You Majesty wouldn't agree until I got mad.
,,,00:20:30.520,00:20:32.780,But I don't like being mad at you.
00:20:41.560,00:20:42.270,皇上,00:20:42.720,00:20:44.520,Your Majesty.
00:20:46.120,00:20:47.470,小主药好了,00:20:47.120,00:20:49.480,"My Lady, here is the medicine."
00:20:49.160,00:20:52.190,小主这药喝了 好似咳嗽少了些,00:20:50.360,00:20:54.000,"My Lady, the medicine seems to be helpful."
00:20:54.880,00:20:58.270,时气反反复复的忽冷忽热,00:20:56.020,00:20:57.880,The weather has been hot and cold.
00:20:58.960,00:21:00.070,好得也慢些,00:20:58.500,00:21:01.020,It slows down my recovery.
00:21:00.760,00:21:03.470,病去如抽丝 哪能好得这么快呢,00:21:01.480,00:21:03.280,"""Recovering from sickness is like pulling silk from a cocoon."""
00:21:03.760,00:21:05.910,只要小主好好调养定会好的,00:21:03.280,00:21:04.720,It takes time.
,,,00:21:04.720,00:21:08.080,"As long as you nurse and nourish yourself,
My Lady, you will surely get well."
00:21:09.320,00:21:11.670,启禀小主 皇上想在未时一刻,00:21:10.460,00:21:11.680,"My Lady,"
00:21:12.040,00:21:13.590,在养心殿西暖阁见一见小主,00:21:11.820,00:21:15.060,"His Majesty wishes to see you in his
West Chamber at a quarter past one."
00:21:14.680,00:21:15.510,有劳公公,,,
00:21:15.800,00:21:16.510,奴才告退,00:21:15.920,00:21:16.900,"Thank you, sir."
00:21:17.200,00:21:18.110,公公慢走,00:21:16.900,00:21:18.320,"Allow me to take my leave, My Lady."
00:21:24.600,00:21:26.070,年羹尧的这道折子,00:21:18.340,00:21:19.480,Goodbye.
00:21:26.400,00:21:27.550,是什么时候送来的,00:21:25.760,00:21:29.220,When was this memorandum from Nian Gengyao sent in?
00:21:30.160,00:21:32.630,约摸是午膳的时刻吧,00:21:31.020,00:21:33.720,About lunch time.
00:21:33.240,00:21:36.310,午膳的时候华妃才请求朕,00:21:34.360,00:21:38.580,Consort Fleur has just sought a reward for Nian Fu at lunch.
00:21:36.640,00:21:37.550,封赏处富,,,
00:21:39.440,00:21:42.390,年羹尧这道请求朕,,,
00:21:42.680,00:21:44.990,嘉赏平定卓子山有功将士的折子,00:21:40.760,00:21:47.500,"And Nian Gengyao has sent in his request for rewarding
the worthy soldiers in the Mount Zhuozi Campaign."
00:21:45.400,00:21:46.350,就上来了,,,
00:21:47.800,00:21:49.070,他们兄妹二人的心思,,,
00:21:49.480,00:21:50.790,倒是如出一辙呀,00:21:49.120,00:21:51.960,"They are ""ploughing the same furrow."""
00:21:52.800,00:21:53.470,苏培盛,,,
00:21:53.960,00:21:54.670,奴才在,00:21:53.820,00:21:54.920,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:21:55.100,00:21:56.240,Your Majesty.
00:21:55.360,00:21:58.990,你这个都太监的人头还要不要,00:21:56.500,00:21:59.460,You will lose your head if this is how you do your job!
00:21:59.840,00:22:03.030,皇上 奴才该死 奴才该死,00:22:00.960,00:22:03.880,"Your Majesty, my offence deserves death."
00:22:04.080,00:22:06.470,但奴才愚昧 请皇上明言,,,
00:22:06.880,00:22:08.030,让奴才死个明白,00:22:05.200,00:22:09.020,"I beg Your Highness would enlighten
my ignorant mind what I did wrong."
00:22:08.400,00:22:09.630,你的眼睛不够亮堂,00:22:09.560,00:22:11.320,Your eyes are not sharp enough.
00:22:11.280,00:22:13.750,这宫里头有人跟外头互通消息,00:22:12.480,00:22:14.920,"There are people inside the palace
trading information with the outside."
00:22:14.120,00:22:15.230,你竟然懵然不知,00:22:14.920,00:22:16.600,Yet you didn't know anything about it.
00:22:15.880,00:22:18.350,和朕一样都是个糊涂人,00:22:16.840,00:22:19.320,You have been as foolish as I have.
00:22:19.720,00:22:21.790,皇上恕罪 皇上恕罪,00:22:20.840,00:22:22.660,I entreat Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:22:22.960,00:22:24.550,请皇上饶奴才一条命,,,
00:22:25.160,00:22:26.870,奴才日后定当加强防范,00:22:24.200,00:22:26.200,I beg Your Majesty would spare my life.
00:22:27.600,00:22:29.950,要不是留着你的脑袋将功折罪,00:22:26.260,00:22:28.460,I will surely keep an eye out from now!
00:22:30.640,00:22:33.630,朕还斥责你做什么起来吧,00:22:28.800,00:22:33.060,I will let you keep your head to atone for yourself.
00:22:34.560,00:22:35.310,谢皇上,00:22:34.420,00:22:35.680,Get up.
,,,00:22:35.680,00:22:37.620,I thank Your Majesty.
00:22:42.160,00:22:45.950,皇上喝点茶消消火,00:22:43.220,00:22:47.180,Your Majesty ... Please have some tea and calm down.
00:22:48.200,00:22:49.510,去把莞贵人叫来,,,
00:22:50.280,00:22:50.950,嗻,00:22:49.380,00:22:51.180,Bring Lady Sourire here.
,,,00:22:51.640,00:22:52.700,Yes.
00:23:08.840,00:23:09.710,你看看这个,,,
00:23:11.480,00:23:12.470,臣妾不敢参政,00:23:10.060,00:23:11.980,Take a look at this.
00:23:12.960,00:23:14.670,这是家事 朕许你看,00:23:12.640,00:23:14.200,I dare not interfere in state affairs.
,,,00:23:14.220,00:23:16.700,This is a family matter. You have my permission.
00:23:24.880,00:23:28.310,皇上 赵之垣弹劾臣妾父亲,00:23:26.100,00:23:29.920,"Your Majesty, Zhao Zhiyuan impeached my father?"
00:23:29.520,00:23:31.230,赵之垣弹劾你父亲,,,
00:23:31.560,00:23:33.070,不敬功臣违背圣意,00:23:30.640,00:23:34.580,"He accuses your father of
disrespecting
an honorable official and disobeying me."
00:23:33.800,00:23:35.430,赵之垣所谓的不敬功臣,,,
00:23:36.200,00:23:37.310,不过是指臣妾父亲,00:23:35.060,00:23:37.080,His so-called disrespect ...
00:23:37.600,00:23:39.510,没有如旁人一般跪迎年大将军,00:23:37.260,00:23:40.540,"is referring to the fact that he
did
not kneel to General Nian like other officials."
00:23:40.000,00:23:42.470,人人都以为朕宠信年羹尧,00:23:41.260,00:23:44.340,"Everyone believed that because I hold Nian Gengyao in high esteem,"
00:23:43.440,00:23:45.510,所以要对年羹尧毕恭毕敬,,,
00:23:45.840,00:23:47.430,才算是顺承圣意,00:23:44.520,00:23:48.860,"they had to show utmost deference
to him as if it were obedience to me."
00:23:48.680,00:23:50.030,皇上看重年大将军,,,
00:23:50.480,00:23:51.950,是因为大将军为国有功,00:23:49.920,00:23:53.360,"Your Majesty thinks highly of General Nian
for his contribution to the country."
00:23:52.680,00:23:55.790,可是功劳再大官员跪迎之礼,00:23:53.980,00:23:57.060,"But however significant his contribution is,"
00:23:56.240,00:23:57.950,上可对皇上 下可对亲王,00:23:57.160,00:23:59.660,"General Nian is but a servant
to the imperial family,"
00:23:58.600,00:24:00.070,断无跪迎人臣之理,00:23:59.700,00:24:01.640,"and officials like my father kneel
only to their emperors and lords."
00:24:00.520,00:24:03.510,你也觉得朕太过宠信年羹尧了,00:24:01.640,00:24:04.560,Do you believe I think too highly of Nian Gengyao?
00:24:03.960,00:24:06.110,臣妾不敢 臣妾只是以为,00:24:04.900,00:24:06.300,I dare not.
00:24:06.760,00:24:08.030,即便皇上宠信,00:24:06.300,00:24:09.320,"I only think that no matter how highly
Your Majesty values Nian Gengyao,"
00:24:08.520,00:24:10.230,年羹尧也不敢居功自傲,,,
00:24:10.680,00:24:11.510,藐视百官,00:24:09.640,00:24:12.880,he wouldn't dare be arrogant enough to despise his peers.
00:24:12.560,00:24:15.390,何况赵之垣是工部通政史,00:24:13.680,00:24:16.860,"Besides, Zhao Zhiyuan is the Review Director
of the Ministry of Public Works."
00:24:16.000,00:24:17.430,他为何不管工部之事,,,
00:24:17.840,00:24:19.590,反而对礼仪之事指手画脚,00:24:17.180,00:24:20.860,Why is he interfering on etiquette rather than tending to his own duties?
00:24:20.000,00:24:21.670,处处为年羹尧歌功颂德,00:24:21.220,00:24:24.000,"He always ""sings the praises"" of Nian Gengyao."
00:24:26.000,00:24:28.870,这折子大有深意 朕得好好看看,00:24:27.140,00:24:30.800,"I will carefully consider the
 implications of his memorandum."
00:24:45.160,00:24:47.510,小主啊 您耐心地候着啊,00:24:46.260,00:24:48.620,"Please be patient, My Lady."
00:24:48.320,00:24:50.790,皇上这会儿正在跟莞贵人说话呢,00:24:49.560,00:24:52.320,His Majesty is talking with Lady Sourire.
00:24:51.520,00:24:52.910,皇上既然有要事,,,
00:24:53.400,00:24:54.670,那我等等也无妨,00:24:52.860,00:24:54.380,"Since His Majesty is busy,"
00:24:57.000,00:24:59.310,这么吧 奴才再进去,00:24:54.500,00:24:56.620,I don't mind waiting for a bit longer.
00:24:59.680,00:25:00.550,替您通报一下,00:24:59.420,00:25:02.080,Allow me to inform His Majesty one more time.
00:25:00.920,00:25:01.670,有劳公公,00:25:02.080,00:25:03.680,"Thank you, sir."
00:25:07.600,00:25:08.270,皇上,00:25:08.820,00:25:10.040,Your Majesty.
00:25:09.760,00:25:10.550,什么事,00:25:11.020,00:25:11.960,What is it?
00:25:11.040,00:25:13.710,安常在已在外候了半个时辰了,00:25:12.160,00:25:14.680,Attendant An has been waiting outside for an hour.
00:25:14.040,00:25:15.030,朕现在有事,,,
00:25:15.760,00:25:17.950,皇上 安妹妹喉疾未愈,00:25:14.920,00:25:16.620,I'm busy right now.
00:25:18.400,00:25:20.230,外头风大不宜让她久候,00:25:16.940,00:25:19.200,"Your Majesty, Lingrong is still recovering from her cough."
00:25:20.640,00:25:22.590,要不臣妾先告退了,00:25:19.520,00:25:21.700,It's windy today and she shouldn't be waiting outside.
00:25:23.200,00:25:24.510,朕和你还有话说,00:25:21.700,00:25:24.180,Will Your Majesty allow me to leave now?
00:25:25.600,00:25:26.230,苏培盛,00:25:24.280,00:25:26.480,But we haven’t finished the conversation.
00:25:26.520,00:25:27.150,奴才在,,,
00:25:27.520,00:25:28.630,你去告诉安常在,00:25:26.760,00:25:28.320,"- Su Peisheng.
- Yes."
00:25:29.320,00:25:30.950,朕现在没心思见她,00:25:28.640,00:25:32.080,Tell Attendant An that I can't spare any time to see her.
00:25:31.360,00:25:32.590,让她回去好好歇着吧,,,
00:25:33.360,00:25:34.070,嗻,00:25:32.440,00:25:34.360,Tell her to go back and have a good rest.
,,,00:25:34.500,00:25:35.600,Yes.
00:25:39.360,00:25:42.110,小主真对不住啊,00:25:40.580,00:25:43.500,My Lady... I’m terribly sorry.
00:25:43.160,00:25:44.470,皇上请您先回去,,,
00:25:45.760,00:25:47.430,这会儿莞贵人在里边,00:25:44.260,00:25:46.140,His Majesty requests you go back.
00:25:48.040,00:25:49.670,皇上实在没空见您,00:25:46.320,00:25:50.640,His Majesty is with Lady Sourire ... and not able to see you.
00:25:51.120,00:25:53.590,皇上有姐姐伺候就成了,00:25:52.260,00:25:55.700,Sourire provides enough company for His Majesty.
00:25:54.880,00:25:55.910,那我先回去了,00:25:56.080,00:25:57.820,I’ll go now.

00:26:20.920,00:26:21.830,小主在养心殿外,,,
00:26:22.200,00:26:23.310,吹了那么久的冷风,00:26:21.580,00:26:24.440,"My Lady, you were standing in the cold wind for so long."
00:26:23.640,00:26:25.830,咳得更厉害了 这可怎么办啊,00:26:24.660,00:26:26.860,It made your cough worse.
00:26:29.800,00:26:30.950,原是我活该,,,
00:26:32.240,00:26:33.950,明知道莞贵人在里头,00:26:30.940,00:26:32.600,I deserve it.
00:26:34.880,00:26:36.510,我还不知好歹地等着,00:26:33.580,00:26:35.660,I already knew that Lady Sourire was inside.
00:26:37.480,00:26:39.510,让人厌烦被赶回来,00:26:36.120,00:26:40.340,But I insisted on waiting and making a fool of myself.
00:26:41.400,00:26:42.750,莞贵人也真是的,,,
00:26:43.080,00:26:44.590,明知道小主您身子不好,00:26:42.480,00:26:43.840,What was in Lady Sourire's mind?
00:26:45.320,00:26:46.350,皇上既然没空,00:26:43.920,00:26:45.880,She knows you are unwell.
00:26:46.800,00:26:48.310,那早点提醒不就好了嘛,00:26:46.580,00:26:49.860,She should have informed you earlier that His Majesty was busy.
00:26:49.000,00:26:50.310,还硬让你吹着风等,00:26:50.180,00:26:53.120,But she would rather leave you outside waiting in the wind.
00:26:53.880,00:26:56.110,小主你手冷了吧 快暖暖,00:26:55.080,00:26:58.040,"My Lady, you must be feeling cold.
Here's the hand warmer."
00:27:04.720,00:27:06.670,启禀娘娘 刚得到的消息,,,
00:27:07.040,00:27:08.790,今天早朝莞贵人的父亲,00:27:06.000,00:27:08.140,"Your Highness, news came in that"
00:27:09.160,00:27:10.910,已被贬为从五品都察院御史了,00:27:08.160,00:27:12.280,"Lady Sourire’s father has been demoted
to the lower fifth rank in the Censorate."
00:27:12.720,00:27:13.350,嗻,,,
00:27:14.240,00:27:16.590,莞贵人在新晋妃嫔中那么得意,00:27:13.960,00:27:15.400,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:27:17.200,00:27:19.430,无外是家世不俗的缘故,00:27:15.400,00:27:20.360,"Lady Sourire has been distinguished among the
new concubines because of her family background."
00:27:20.160,00:27:21.310,如今被贬了,,,
00:27:21.880,00:27:23.550,看她还怎么抬得起头来,00:27:21.240,00:27:24.720,"Now that her father is demoted, I wonder
if she will still hold her head high."
00:27:23.920,00:27:26.150,赵之垣还算是个会做事的人,00:27:24.980,00:27:27.220,Zhao Zhiyuan is competent.
00:27:26.920,00:27:28.830,本宫跟哥哥稍稍授意,,,
00:27:29.320,00:27:30.670,他就上书弹劾,00:27:28.120,00:27:31.380,"He took the hint from me and my brother
and staged the impeachment."
00:27:31.480,00:27:33.150,如此看来 这莞贵人,,,
00:27:33.560,00:27:36.310,在皇上心中的分量也不重啊,00:27:32.680,00:27:36.900,"It appears that Lady Sourire now carries
little weight in His Majesty's heart."
00:27:36.720,00:27:38.150,新人新鲜,,,
00:27:38.640,00:27:40.670,可她现在也已经不算新人了,00:27:37.980,00:27:41.500,Her freshness as a new concubine has expired.
00:27:41.320,00:27:43.790,那是怎比得上娘娘,00:27:42.540,00:27:45.020,That's true. She can't compare to Your Highness.
00:27:44.120,00:27:45.710,您受皇上恩宠多处,00:27:45.020,00:27:47.520,Your Highness has been favored by His Majesty all along.
00:27:46.760,00:27:48.070,早说这些日子,,,
00:27:48.440,00:27:51.110,皇上只见了莞贵人一次,00:27:48.020,00:27:52.320,I heard that His Majesty has only seen her once lately.
00:27:56.680,00:27:58.230,新鲜劲儿过了,,,
00:27:58.760,00:28:01.710,她这道菜也算是凉透了,00:27:58.020,00:28:02.720,"If she was a course in a meal, she
would have become stale and cold."
00:28:02.480,00:28:04.190,那什么时候撤了这道菜,,,
00:28:05.040,00:28:07.430,可就是娘娘您说了算啊,00:28:03.580,00:28:08.620,"And it's up to Your Highness
when to take away the plate."
00:28:18.880,00:28:20.070,这羹都放凉了,,,
00:28:20.440,00:28:21.830,小主怎么动都没有动呢,00:28:20.040,00:28:21.480,"The soup is getting cold, My Lady."
00:28:22.480,00:28:24.390,觉得烦闷不想吃,00:28:21.540,00:28:23.140,You didn't eat any.
,,,00:28:23.520,00:28:26.100,I feel upset. I have no appetite.
00:28:25.520,00:28:28.550,小主为了老爷的事情不痛快,00:28:26.680,00:28:29.720,"My Lady, you must be feeling upset about ... father."
00:28:29.200,00:28:30.510,也要顾及自己的身子,00:28:30.300,00:28:32.400,But you have to care for your health.
00:28:33.000,00:28:34.150,不痛快又有什么用,,,
00:28:34.800,00:28:35.910,都是皇上的旨意,00:28:34.160,00:28:35.760,What's the point of feeling upset?
00:28:37.280,00:28:38.790,小主最近的胃口不好,00:28:35.960,00:28:37.520,It is His Majesty’s decree.
00:28:39.240,00:28:40.950,要不我去请温太医来瞧瞧,00:28:38.500,00:28:40.400,"My Lady, your appetite has been low lately."
00:28:41.240,00:28:43.590,罢了 温太医要照顾,00:28:40.520,00:28:42.120,Shall I send for Dr Wen?
00:28:44.000,00:28:44.830,眉姐姐的身子,00:28:42.380,00:28:43.820,No.
00:28:46.480,00:28:48.030,我想许是我前些日子,00:28:44.060,00:28:46.460,Dr Wen is busy taking care of Meizhuang.
00:28:48.480,00:28:50.030,吃了油腻的东西腻着了,00:28:47.620,00:28:51.180,Perhaps I've eaten too much greasy food lately.
00:28:53.160,00:28:56.150,身上乏得很 先去睡了,00:28:54.140,00:28:57.140,I feel tired. I'm going to bed now.
00:28:57.320,00:28:59.710,小主近日贪睡 跟个小猫似的,00:28:57.880,00:29:01.000,"You've become a sleepy kitten, My Lady."
00:29:02.280,00:29:05.670,都开春了 可还觉得身上凉得很,00:29:03.520,00:29:06.920,"Although it is spring now, I still feel cold all over."
00:29:07.120,00:29:08.550,去帮我拢个汤婆子吧,00:29:08.320,00:29:11.300,Go fill a hot water warmer for me.
00:29:14.680,00:29:16.590,皇上今夜翻了小主的牌子,00:29:15.900,00:29:18.180,"His Majesty selected you for the night, My Lady."
00:29:17.040,00:29:19.110,小主可要打扮得漂亮一点,00:29:18.280,00:29:20.360,You must look your best.
00:29:20.960,00:29:22.430,我方才去了碎玉轩,00:29:21.800,00:29:23.600,I went to the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:29:23.680,00:29:25.030,觉得姐姐真是可怜,00:29:24.880,00:29:26.580,I feel so sorry for Sourire.
00:29:26.080,00:29:27.630,难为她还有心情睡觉,00:29:27.160,00:29:29.220,I don't know how she could sleep.
00:29:28.600,00:29:30.430,莞贵人的父亲被贬官,00:29:29.600,00:29:31.480,Lady Sourire’s father was demoted.
00:29:30.960,00:29:33.150,莞贵人心里实在是不好受了,00:29:32.080,00:29:34.280,"She must be in distress,"
00:29:34.080,00:29:35.950,这会子不知道多少人,,,
00:29:36.360,00:29:37.430,等着看笑话呢,00:29:35.320,00:29:38.480,worrying about everyone laughing at her.
00:29:38.240,00:29:40.590,还不如推了 说睡了不见人呢,00:29:39.340,00:29:41.880,So she found an excuse to avoid seeing people.
00:29:41.600,00:29:43.350,姐姐入宫承宠以来,,,
00:29:43.840,00:29:47.750,就一直很得意没想到也有今天,00:29:42.760,00:29:46.160,Sourire was always in high favor with His Majesty.
00:29:48.840,00:29:50.150,小主真是好心,00:29:46.860,00:29:49.640,What a surprise!
00:29:50.920,00:29:52.430,那日在养心殿门口,00:29:50.140,00:29:51.920,"You are still being kind to her, My Lady."
00:29:52.680,00:29:55.030,她让您冻了那么久 您还可怜她,00:29:52.160,00:29:54.920,She kept you waiting outside the Hall of Mental Cultivation the other day.
00:29:55.680,00:29:58.630,宝鹃说句心里话,00:29:55.140,00:29:56.820,Why do you feel sorry for her?
00:29:59.360,00:30:00.830,我除了觉得可怜她,00:29:56.820,00:29:59.980,"Coua, to tell you the truth,"
00:30:01.480,00:30:02.910,心里还有些许欣慰,00:30:00.400,00:30:04.260,"Not only do I feel sorry, but also relieved."
00:30:03.520,00:30:04.310,欣慰,,,
00:30:05.120,00:30:06.870,莞贵人什么都比我强,00:30:04.660,00:30:06.200,Relieved?
,,,00:30:06.380,00:30:08.320,She is better than me in every way.
00:30:07.320,00:30:10.270,比我得宠比我讨皇上喜欢,00:30:08.320,00:30:11.020,She gained more favor from His Majesty
00:30:11.160,00:30:12.550,家世更是高于我,,,
00:30:13.680,00:30:15.470,可如今她父亲被贬了,00:30:12.260,00:30:14.660,and has a better family background.
00:30:16.200,00:30:18.390,我忽然觉得我跟她的距离,00:30:15.020,00:30:16.960,But now that her father is demoted
00:30:18.720,00:30:19.670,拉近了许多,00:30:17.340,00:30:20.600,I no longer feel that our situations are so far apart.
00:30:20.440,00:30:22.750,再没那种她高高在上的感觉了,00:30:21.780,00:30:24.140,She's no longer distantly above me.
00:30:23.640,00:30:25.390,小主真是委屈你了,,,
00:30:25.800,00:30:27.230,明明怀着龙裔的人是我,00:30:24.860,00:30:26.480,"My Lady, I’m sorry you felt that way."
00:30:27.600,00:30:28.390,又不是安常在,00:30:26.640,00:30:29.060,"I'm the one carrying an imperial heir.
Not Attendant An!"
00:30:28.880,00:30:30.750,怎么皇上只说要安常在侍寝,00:30:29.880,00:30:31.900,Why does His Majesty only see Attendant An?
00:30:31.200,00:30:32.670,怕是有人想趁着我有孕,,,
00:30:33.040,00:30:33.990,就想狐媚皇上吧,00:30:32.380,00:30:35.040,Isn't she being a minx and taking advantage of my pregnancy?
00:30:34.360,00:30:35.150,小主别理她,,,
00:30:35.560,00:30:37.790,富察贵人惯会的就是欺软怕硬,00:30:35.420,00:30:38.560,"Let her be, My Lady.
Lady Fuca always bullies the weak."
00:30:38.120,00:30:38.910,这样难听的话,,,
00:30:39.560,00:30:41.110,从我住进延禧宫开始,,,
00:30:41.720,00:30:44.230,早得还少吗 我理她做什么,00:30:39.020,00:30:43.760,"I haven't stopped hearing spiteful words since
moving into the Palace of Prolonging Happiness."
00:30:44.440,00:30:45.110,是,00:30:44.240,00:30:45.660,This is nothing new.
00:30:46.000,00:30:47.950,如今开春暖和些了,00:30:45.660,00:30:46.740,"Yes, My Lady."
00:30:48.280,00:30:49.150,你身子好些了没有,00:30:47.700,00:30:49.320,Spring is coming and it's getting warmer.
00:30:49.920,00:30:52.550,多谢皇上关心 臣妾好多了,00:30:49.320,00:30:50.880,Have you been feeling better?
00:30:53.400,00:30:55.510,现在有华妃帮我照顾六宫,00:30:51.080,00:30:53.960,"I thank Your Majesty for asking.
I have been feeling much better."
00:30:56.120,00:30:57.470,臣妾清闲些,00:30:54.560,00:30:57.080,"Now that Consort Fleur assists
 in the palace affairs"
00:30:58.760,00:31:01.270,你前阵子是因为头风发作,00:30:57.320,00:30:59.620,I have more time to myself.
00:31:01.960,00:31:04.750,所以将六宫之事委于华妃了,00:31:00.040,00:31:05.600,"You handed over the palace affairs to her
when your migraines became so severe."
00:31:05.320,00:31:06.710,臣妾还没发落,,,
00:31:06.960,00:31:09.230,六宫中人已落叶知秋,00:31:06.380,00:31:09.420,"Before I announced it, the concubines had
already started to report to Consort Fleur,"
00:31:09.560,00:31:10.750,事事向华妃禀报,00:31:09.420,00:31:11.700,"just as if they could ""tell autumn from the falling leaves""."
00:31:11.840,00:31:15.510,到底华妃年轻 做事利落,00:31:12.920,00:31:16.640,Consort Fleur is young  ... and efficient.
00:31:16.240,00:31:18.070,华妃是协理过六宫的,00:31:17.400,00:31:19.380,Consort Fleur always assisted with the palace affairs.
00:31:18.360,00:31:19.790,自然是熟能生巧,00:31:19.480,00:31:21.240,She's experienced in the responsibilities.
00:31:21.320,00:31:22.750,难得六宫归心,00:31:22.540,00:31:24.260,The imperial harem is finally in harmony.
00:31:23.240,00:31:25.390,臣妾也不好不叫华妃管,00:31:24.360,00:31:27.440,"It would be inappropriate for me to keep
Consort Fleur out of palace management."
00:31:26.840,00:31:30.430,时疫之事 华妃功不可没,00:31:28.080,00:31:31.680,Consort Fleur made undeniable contributions to stop the plague.
00:31:31.080,00:31:34.630,如今她也谨慎 驯顺,00:31:32.300,00:31:36.040,And she is more prudent and decorous now.
00:31:35.520,00:31:38.270,倒是可以恢复她协理六宫之权了,00:31:36.620,00:31:39.380,It's about time to reinstate her authority in palace management.
00:31:38.600,00:31:39.990,皇上做主就是了,,,
00:31:40.840,00:31:41.950,倒有一件事,00:31:39.740,00:31:41.400,I will follow Your Majesty's decision.
00:31:42.240,00:31:45.750,臣妾想为莞贵人求句情,00:31:42.000,00:31:46.700,But there's something I wish to mention about Lady Sourire.
00:31:45.960,00:31:47.030,朕知道你要说什么,,,
00:31:48.000,00:31:49.310,莞贵人的父亲有错,00:31:46.720,00:31:48.800,I know what you want to say.
00:31:49.680,00:31:50.750,朕已经责罚他了,00:31:49.120,00:31:51.840,I have punished Lady Sourire's father for his own mistake.
00:31:51.280,00:31:52.630,这不干莞贵人的事,,,
00:31:53.160,00:31:54.670,皇上您公私分明,00:31:52.280,00:31:53.860,That does not affect Lady Sourire.
00:31:55.120,00:31:57.230,可是六宫中人不是这样想,00:31:54.060,00:31:56.280,"Your Majesty draws a clear line between the court and the harem,"
,,,00:31:56.280,00:31:58.560,but concubines don't always do so.
00:31:57.960,00:31:59.910,莞贵人一直是皇上喜爱的,00:31:59.140,00:32:01.440,Your Majesty has always been very fond of Lady Sourire.
00:32:00.440,00:32:03.470,可她的父亲让她落得人家的笑柄,00:32:01.620,00:32:04.900,But now the concubines joke about her for what her father did.
00:32:04.880,00:32:06.070,皇上要是有心,,,
00:32:06.440,00:32:08.510,今天晚上就去看看她吧,00:32:06.080,00:32:10.040,"If Your Majesty feels sympathetic for her,
please go visit her tonight."
00:32:09.720,00:32:13.550,不是你跟朕说 安常在思念朕吗,00:32:10.920,00:32:14.460,"But you told me that Attendant An missed me, didn't you?"
00:32:14.800,00:32:17.470,朕今夜已经翻了安常在的牌子了,00:32:15.980,00:32:19.340,I have already selected Attendant An for tonight.
00:32:18.880,00:32:21.150,皇上 您一直理政务的事,00:32:20.160,00:32:22.740,"Your Majesty has been
buried in state affairs."
00:32:21.680,00:32:24.350,六宫嫔妃哪有一个不想皇上,00:32:22.920,00:32:25.940,How can any concubine not miss Your Majesty?
00:32:25.400,00:32:29.110,不过安常在与莞贵人一直都交好,00:32:26.520,00:32:30.240,"However, Attendant An has always been very close with Lady Sourire."
00:32:30.000,00:32:31.670,这安抚莞贵人的事,,,
00:32:32.240,00:32:33.870,看来她也会体谅的,00:32:31.140,00:32:34.980,She will understand Your Majesty's sympathy for Lady Sourire.
00:32:35.560,00:32:38.950,这样也好 朕也不希望莞贵人,,,
00:32:39.640,00:32:41.510,因为她父亲的事郁郁寡欢,00:32:36.900,00:32:42.440,"That will be good. I don't want Lady Sourire
to feel upset because of her father."
00:32:41.720,00:32:42.310,苏培盛,00:32:42.840,00:32:44.060,Su Peisheng.
00:32:44.000,00:32:44.670,奴才在,00:32:45.200,00:32:46.300,Your Majesty.
00:32:45.240,00:32:49.510,传旨召莞贵人入养心殿侍寝,00:32:46.300,00:32:50.940,"Announce that Lady Sourire will
stay in the Hall of Mental Cultivation tonight."
00:32:50.240,00:32:50.950,嗻,00:32:51.460,00:32:52.860,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:33:04.080,00:33:06.550,小主凤鸾春恩车就要到了,00:33:05.280,00:33:07.840,"My Lady, the Phoenix Carriage will be here soon."
00:33:06.920,00:33:07.830,小主稍等片刻,00:33:07.840,00:33:09.560,Please be patient.
00:33:12.520,00:33:13.990,皇上难得召幸,,,
00:33:14.360,00:33:15.830,好好地打扮着去吧,00:33:13.740,00:33:15.540,His Majesty rarely selects you for the night.
,,,00:33:15.540,00:33:17.640,You must dress nicely ...
00:33:16.760,00:33:19.470,下回还不知道是什么时候呢,00:33:17.860,00:33:20.740,Otherwise His Majesty won't be interested in selecting you again.
00:33:20.080,00:33:20.910,贵人放心,,,
00:33:21.680,00:33:23.830,妹妹见着皇上一定替贵人,00:33:21.260,00:33:22.740,"Don't worry, Lady Fuca."
00:33:24.160,00:33:26.070,向皇上转达贵人的相思之苦,00:33:22.840,00:33:26.740,I will certainly convey to His Majesty that you miss him.
00:33:26.320,00:33:28.070,你是笑话我见不着皇上,00:33:27.240,00:33:29.320,Are you laughing about me not being chosen to see His Majesty?
00:33:28.320,00:33:30.790,岂敢 只是妹妹不忍见贵人,,,
00:33:31.160,00:33:32.390,苦苦思念皇上,00:33:29.320,00:33:33.320,"Why would I dare to? I just can't bear
seeing you distressed, missing His Majesty."
00:33:32.680,00:33:34.670,所以特意代为转达,00:33:33.740,00:33:35.740,So I wish to speak to His Majesty for you.
00:33:34.920,00:33:37.750,笑话我怀着皇上的孩子,00:33:35.740,00:33:37.100,How funny!
00:33:38.160,00:33:41.030,什么时候想见皇上都可以,00:33:37.340,00:33:42.100,"I'm carrying His Majesty's child.
I can see His Majesty whenever I want to."
00:33:41.360,00:33:42.110,那是自然,,,
00:33:42.600,00:33:45.110,只不过贵人下次见皇上,00:33:42.340,00:33:43.760,You surely can.
00:33:45.520,00:33:47.350,别再说是龙胎不适,00:33:43.880,00:33:48.320,"But the next time you call for His Majesty,
better not say it's a ""fetal disorder."""
00:33:47.720,00:33:49.910,皇上听多了也厌烦了,00:33:48.920,00:33:51.180,His Majesty will be annoyed if he hears that too much.
00:33:50.280,00:33:51.270,你居然如此,00:33:51.400,00:33:53.020,How dare you ...
00:33:55.320,00:33:58.790,给富察贵人请安 给安常在请安,00:33:56.440,00:33:59.920,"Peace to Lady Fuca.
Peace to Attendant An."
00:33:59.440,00:34:02.150,苏公公这会子您怎么过来了,00:34:00.640,00:34:02.880,"What brings you here, Mr Su?"
00:34:03.040,00:34:03.910,皇上有旨,,,
00:34:04.480,00:34:06.870,小主您今晚不必侍寝了,00:34:03.800,00:34:08.020,"My lady, at His Majesty's behest,
you won't be serving him tonight."
00:34:07.440,00:34:09.550,可是皇上今晚翻的是我的牌子,00:34:08.560,00:34:11.360,But His Majesty selected me for tonight!
00:34:10.800,00:34:12.510,皇上翻的是您的牌子,00:34:11.840,00:34:13.560,"Yes, My Lady."
00:34:12.920,00:34:14.230,可是刚才皇上又传了,,,
00:34:14.640,00:34:15.870,莞贵人去侍寝了,00:34:14.060,00:34:17.000,But His Majesty called for Lady Sourire just now.
00:34:16.480,00:34:19.350,凤鸾春恩车已经接了莞贵人去了,00:34:17.640,00:34:20.960,"The Phoenix Carriage has brought
Lady Sourire to the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:34:21.000,00:34:24.070,皇上圣意有变那也是寻常事啊,00:34:22.180,00:34:25.260,It's not unusual that His Majesty changes his mind.
00:34:25.200,00:34:28.310,许是皇上体谅小主咳疾未愈,,,
00:34:28.800,00:34:31.790,想让小主多休息几日再侍寝吧,00:34:26.520,00:34:32.720,"My Lady, perhaps His Majesty wishes you to have a good rest and recover from your cough sooner."
00:34:32.320,00:34:33.110,多谢公公,00:34:33.500,00:34:34.740,"Thank you, Mr Su."
00:34:34.520,00:34:35.830,那奴才先告退了,00:34:35.780,00:34:37.520,Allow me to take my leave.
00:34:42.440,00:34:44.910,看来是我高估安常在了,00:34:42.500,00:34:46.100,It seems that I have overestimated Attendant An.
00:34:45.520,00:34:47.910,这回都没了还下回呢,00:34:46.720,00:34:49.280,"Now I don't even expect you will have a ""next time."""
00:34:49.360,00:34:52.470,可惜了打扮得如此娇艳,00:34:50.540,00:34:51.760,What a shame.
00:34:52.800,00:34:54.510,皇上连看都不看一眼,00:34:51.860,00:34:53.620,You have dressed up so nicely
,,,00:34:53.800,00:34:55.800,but His Majesty wouldn't even bother to look at you.
00:34:55.240,00:34:57.190,翻了牌子却懊悔了,00:34:56.260,00:34:58.220,He selected you and regretted it.
00:34:58.840,00:35:01.470,不过呢 毕竟是好姐妹,00:34:59.820,00:35:02.460,"However, you and Sourire are like sisters."
00:35:01.880,00:35:04.110,你没得去就换莞贵人去,00:35:03.080,00:35:05.240,You two can take turns serving His Majesty.
00:35:04.560,00:35:07.270,谁伺候皇上还不都是一样的,00:35:05.820,00:35:08.380,It's no different.
00:35:08.080,00:35:11.150,只是难为她父亲才被贬官,,,
00:35:11.440,00:35:15.470,皇上还肯想着她 这样的好本事,00:35:09.380,00:35:13.780,"But it's surprising that His Majesty would see her
when her father has just been demoted."
00:35:16.040,00:35:18.710,安妹妹你必得好好学学呀,00:35:15.200,00:35:20.160,"You've got a lot to learn from her, Lingrong."
00:35:29.680,00:35:34.950,为什么 为什么一定要抢我的,00:35:30.620,00:35:32.720,Why ...
,,,00:35:33.940,00:35:37.120,Why must she steal from me?
00:35:37.600,00:35:42.510,你最近瘦了 在朕跟前话也少了,00:35:38.260,00:35:41.500,You've been losing weight
,,,00:35:41.760,00:35:43.920,and have been more quiet with me.
00:35:45.160,00:35:48.190,许是因为春天人爱犯懒,00:35:46.280,00:35:49.320,Perhaps it's just springtime fatigue.
00:35:49.240,00:35:50.870,身子再懒也要动动,00:35:50.380,00:35:52.680,Try to be more active even if you feel tired.
00:35:51.960,00:35:53.910,春日是爱招病的,00:35:53.240,00:35:55.200,We are more likely to get sick in the spring.
00:35:55.240,00:35:58.990,皇上富察贵人小主,00:35:56.300,00:35:57.700,"Your Majesty,"
00:35:59.320,00:36:00.470,觉得胎动不适,00:35:58.860,00:36:01.360,Lady Fuca feels uncomfortable due to fetal movement.
00:36:01.200,00:36:02.270,很想见见皇上,,,
00:36:03.280,00:36:04.830,请皇上去看看她吧,00:36:02.620,00:36:05.880,She wishes Your Majesty could keep her company.
00:36:05.960,00:36:08.630,皇上去吧 臣妾这里不要紧,00:36:06.620,00:36:07.980,Your Majesty should go.
00:36:10.400,00:36:11.870,让太医去照顾吧,00:36:08.420,00:36:10.040,I will be all right.
,,,00:36:11.500,00:36:13.820,Ask the imperial doctors to take care of her.
00:36:13.120,00:36:13.830,嗻,00:36:14.320,00:36:15.400,Yes.
00:36:16.320,00:36:18.030,富察贵人第一次怀龙胎,00:36:17.320,00:36:19.520,This is Lady Fuca's first time being pregnant.
00:36:19.080,00:36:21.150,皇上多陪陪她也是应该的,00:36:20.200,00:36:22.660,Your Majesty should spend more time with her.
00:36:21.840,00:36:23.430,难得你肯这样体谅,00:36:22.900,00:36:25.120,I appreciate your consideration.
00:36:24.120,00:36:27.550,那好你就睡在这儿,,,
00:36:27.840,00:36:28.990,明日再回碎玉轩,00:36:27.300,00:36:30.360,You should stay here and go back tomorrow.
00:36:29.960,00:36:32.830,省得夜深露重的来回折朕,00:36:31.120,00:36:33.720,It's too cold to travel in the middle of the night.
00:36:33.440,00:36:34.110,是,00:36:34.660,00:36:35.700,Yes.
00:36:47.200,00:36:50.150,皇上万福金安 皇后万福金安,00:36:48.300,00:36:51.260,Peace and grace to Your Majesties.

,,,00:36:52.680,00:36:54.300,I thank Your Majesty.
00:36:55.920,00:36:58.350,你脸色不太好赶紧坐下,00:36:57.200,00:36:58.620,You look unwell.
,,,00:36:58.680,00:37:00.540,Sit down quickly.
00:37:01.000,00:37:03.310,你瞧瞧你眼圈都黑了,00:37:01.940,00:37:04.260,You've got dark circles under your eyes
00:37:04.280,00:37:05.750,早说昨天富察贵人,,,
00:37:06.080,00:37:07.190,也请皇上过去了,00:37:05.400,00:37:08.260,I heard that Lady Fuca invited Your Majesty last night.

00:37:09.520,00:37:10.470,没什么大事,00:37:08.820,00:37:10.360,Did she feel unwell?
,,,00:37:10.560,00:37:11.700,She was fine.
00:37:11.400,00:37:13.630,是富察贵人耍小性子,00:37:12.600,00:37:14.640,Lady Fuca was petulant last night.
00:37:14.240,00:37:16.990,怨朕去得晚了又嚷嚷着恶心,00:37:15.460,00:37:18.100,She was complaining that I arrived late and she was feeling nauseous.
00:37:17.320,00:37:18.190,闹得朕头痛,00:37:18.380,00:37:19.720,That gave me a headache.
00:37:20.080,00:37:22.470,宫中的疫情稍有遏制之象,00:37:21.320,00:37:24.120,The plague has been under control in the palace

00:37:26.760,00:37:29.030,朕要恢复华妃协理六宫之权,00:37:26.180,00:37:30.640,Therefore I restore her authority to assist in palace management.
00:37:33.320,00:37:34.710,臣妾谢过皇上,00:37:34.460,00:37:36.280,I thank Your Majesty.

00:37:50.320,00:37:53.750,敬嫔久侍宫闱性情温良,00:37:51.540,00:37:54.920,"For her dedication to the palace and gentle temperament,"

00:39:55.400,00:39:56.190,你信吗,00:39:53.620,00:39:57.140,"If I say that that I meant it, will you believe me?"
00:39:57.520,00:39:58.590,既然病好了,,,
00:39:59.200,00:40:00.950,干脆起来出去走走吧,00:39:58.680,00:40:02.240,"Since you feel better today, why don't we go out for a walk?"
00:40:01.600,00:40:04.870,我才懒得出去见到人就烦,00:40:02.680,00:40:04.400,I don't want to go out.
,,,00:40:04.780,00:40:06.340,It annoys me to see people.
00:40:05.280,00:40:08.030,倒是这里清清静静的好,00:40:06.340,00:40:09.480,I have peace and quiet in my chamber.
00:40:11.240,00:40:13.910,温大人来了我还没谢你呢,00:40:12.380,00:40:15.340,"Nice seeing you here, Dr. Wen.
I haven't had a chance to thank you."
00:40:14.400,00:40:16.590,姐姐的病多亏你妙手回春,00:40:15.440,00:40:17.960,Meizhuang owes a lot to your excellent care.
00:40:17.080,00:40:17.990,微臣不敢居功,,,
00:40:18.600,00:40:19.950,都是太医院的诸位贤能们,00:40:18.260,00:40:19.700,"I don't deserve the credit, My Lady."
00:40:20.280,00:40:21.070,寻的好方子,00:40:19.780,00:40:21.960,It was the imperial doctors who found the remedy.
00:40:21.360,00:40:22.990,微臣才能够略尽绵力,00:40:22.360,00:40:24.340,I only made small contributions.
00:40:24.440,00:40:25.750,温大人好脉息,,,
00:40:26.000,00:40:27.230,太医院人尽皆知,,,
00:40:27.720,00:40:29.030,大人又何必过谦呢,00:40:25.680,00:40:30.500,"Dr. Wen is being modest. Everyone in the
Imperial Infirmary knows you have excellent medical skills."
00:40:35.720,00:40:37.790,温大人进来也不通报一声,00:40:36.900,00:40:39.280,Why didn't anyone announce Dr. Wen's arrival?
00:40:38.200,00:40:41.230,我这样蓬头垢面的真是失礼了,00:40:39.280,00:40:42.260,It's so impolite of me with my hair disheveled and my face unwashed.
00:40:41.600,00:40:43.710,姐姐纵然病了也是病美人儿,00:40:42.800,00:40:44.860,You're beautiful regardless.
00:40:44.400,00:40:45.710,西施有心痛病,,,
00:40:46.000,00:40:48.350,可人家东施还巴巴地要效颦呢,00:40:45.280,00:40:47.180,"When Xi Shi [an ancient beauty] was walking painfully and grimacing,"
00:40:49.080,00:40:49.830,可见美人儿,00:40:47.260,00:40:50.200,Dong Shi [an ugly woman] still wished to look like her and imitated her walk.
00:40:50.080,00:40:51.750,不分病与不病都是美的,00:40:50.200,00:40:52.920,A beauty is a beauty whether she's sick or not.
00:40:52.360,00:40:53.030,二来,,,
00:40:53.560,00:40:55.350,温大人照顾眉姐姐这段日子,,,
00:40:55.800,00:40:56.830,也算是熟识了,00:40:53.660,00:40:57.960,"Besides, Dr. Wen has been taking care of you
and knows you well."
00:40:57.160,00:40:58.550,咱们就不闹这些虚文了,00:40:58.240,00:41:00.060,We can forgo the formalities.
00:40:59.120,00:41:03.070,是温大人照顾周到我心里明白,00:41:00.380,00:41:04.240,"I appreciate your thoughtful and thorough care, Dr. Wen."
00:41:07.760,00:41:09.830,小主只是吃这些清粥小菜,00:41:08.820,00:41:11.000,"My Lady, you have been only eating porridge with pickles."
00:41:10.200,00:41:10.990,虽然清淡落胃,,,
00:41:11.480,00:41:13.110,但也终究没什么滋养,00:41:11.000,00:41:12.660,"Although they are light and easy to digest,"
00:41:13.440,00:41:15.750,不如微臣给小主拟几个药膳吧,00:41:12.660,00:41:14.460,they are not nourishing enough.
,,,00:41:14.600,00:41:17.420,"May I recommend some dietary therapies for you, My Lady?"
00:41:16.920,00:41:19.310,刚刚我看莞贵人的精神也不大好,00:41:18.060,00:41:20.760,I notice that Lady Sourire also looks a bit tired.
00:41:19.800,00:41:23.110,不如用东阿阿胶炖了羊肉来吃,00:41:20.860,00:41:23.760,I recommend lamb stewed with ejiao [meat gelatin] from Dong’e.
00:41:23.480,00:41:24.270,最补血气,,,
00:41:24.720,00:41:25.710,多谢你费心了,00:41:23.760,00:41:25.660,It will enrich blood and qi.
,,,00:41:25.800,00:41:27.620,Thank you for thinking of me.
00:41:26.640,00:41:29.910,你呀总是可以让人为你费心的,00:41:27.920,00:41:30.560,You always inspire others to think of you.
00:41:30.560,00:41:32.670,温太医你说是不是,00:41:31.600,00:41:33.720,"Am I right, Dr. Wen?"
00:41:33.720,00:41:35.390,这都是微臣分内之事,00:41:34.860,00:41:36.880,It is my duty.
00:41:36.240,00:41:38.750,那微臣去为两位小主拟方子了,00:41:37.380,00:41:40.580,"If you allow me, My Ladies,
I will go write the prescriptions now."
00:41:44.360,00:41:46.390,姐姐说了半天的话也累了,00:41:45.600,00:41:47.640,You must be tired from all the talking.
00:41:46.920,00:41:47.790,先睡一会儿吧,00:41:48.100,00:41:50.000,You should take a nap.
00:41:50.040,00:41:53.190,我瞧你脸色也不好是怎么了,00:41:51.300,00:41:54.720,You don't look very well today. What's wrong?
00:41:54.000,00:41:56.750,没什么夜里没睡好罢了,00:41:55.180,00:41:58.060,Nothing. I didn't sleep well last night.
00:41:57.440,00:41:59.150,我如今虽在井中,00:41:58.620,00:42:00.600,"Although I've been ""trapped in a well"","
00:41:59.480,00:42:02.630,但外面的天气也未必全然不知,00:42:00.600,00:42:03.820,I can still see how the weather is changing outside.
00:42:03.440,00:42:06.950,如今华妃正是风光无限,00:42:04.700,00:42:08.080,Consort Fleur is now back to power again.
00:42:08.080,00:42:11.110,华妃重掌六宫大权,00:42:09.340,00:42:12.520,Consort Fleur regained her authority in palace management.
00:42:12.880,00:42:16.430,之前的心思算是白费了,00:42:14.000,00:42:17.560,All our efforts are now in vain.
