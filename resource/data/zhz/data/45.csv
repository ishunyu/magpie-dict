00:02:54.250,00:02:55.160,杏花,,,
00:02:56.920,00:03:00.670,花虽美好 可是结出的果子极酸,00:02:55.100,00:02:59.000,"Despite their beautiful flowers,"
00:03:01.470,00:03:02.800,杏仁更是苦涩,00:03:00.000,00:03:02.118,apricots are sour
00:03:05.180,00:03:06.390,若是为人做事,00:03:02.118,00:03:04.240,and the seeds are bitter.
00:03:08.060,00:03:10.390,皆是开头美好而结局潦倒,00:03:06.100,00:03:08.460,Life is meaningless
00:03:10.890,00:03:11.760,又有何意义呢,00:03:08.726,00:03:13.300,if it begins well but ends badly.
00:03:15.020,00:03:19.480,倒不如像松柏终年青翠,00:03:15.940,00:03:24.400,"I'd rather have an evergreen life like pine
and cypress, and not bloom or bear fruit."
00:03:21.450,00:03:23.030,无花无果也就罢了,,,
00:03:24.280,00:03:25.990,小主 我们该回去了,00:03:25.020,00:03:27.300,"My Lady, we should head back."
00:03:26.540,00:03:28.650,小厨房做了南北杏炖鹤鸽,00:03:27.520,00:03:30.060,The kitchen made partridge stew with sweet and bitter apricot kernels.
00:03:29.040,00:03:31.030,这个时候吃最滋润不过了,00:03:30.120,00:03:32.280,It’s most nutritious this time of year.
00:03:35.840,00:03:38.580,回吧 我也饿了,00:03:36.680,00:03:38.000,Let’s go back.
,,,00:03:38.697,00:03:40.000,I do feel hungry.
00:03:55.730,00:03:56.720,启奏皇上,00:03:56.560,00:03:58.020,Your Majesty.
00:03:57.820,00:04:02.360,臣以为钱名世一案当适可而止,00:03:58.660,00:04:05.860,"I humbly suggest that the case of
Qian Mingshi need not be pursued further."
00:04:03.070,00:04:04.650,且不可过度追究,,,
00:04:05.320,00:04:08.030,诗书问罪的事一旦蔓延开来,00:04:06.200,00:04:09.317,Condemning poems have been written.
00:04:08.660,00:04:11.150,朝堂之上便会人人自危,00:04:09.440,00:04:12.550,More may lead to everyone in court living in fear.
00:04:11.580,00:04:14.870,谁还敢畅所欲言 畅所欲书,00:04:12.816,00:04:15.718,Who would dare to speak or write freely?
00:04:15.580,00:04:18.290,若是朝中文人阿谈之风盛行,00:04:16.473,00:04:19.365,"If adulation dominates the court,"
00:04:18.920,00:04:23.790,那浩然正气便难以张扬了,00:04:20.000,00:04:24.480,it will be hard to promote righteousness.
00:04:24.260,00:04:26.920,你是说朕堵塞言路吗,00:04:25.000,00:04:28.000,Are you suggesting that I am suppressing criticism?
00:04:27.930,00:04:28.790,臣不敢,00:04:28.720,00:04:30.140,I dare not.
00:04:31.020,00:04:34.050,只是臣身为言官,00:04:31.940,00:04:35.386,"It’s only that as a civil official,"
00:04:34.730,00:04:38.020,尚不能悟尽职守直抒胸臆,00:04:35.830,00:04:38.900,"if I cannot perform my duty and speak freely,"
00:04:38.480,00:04:42.940,那便真的是有负皇上隆恩了,00:04:39.140,00:04:43.840,then I am failing to fulfill Your Majesty’s great benevolence.
00:04:47.780,00:04:48.740,启禀皇上,00:04:48.700,00:04:50.260,Your Majesty.
00:04:50.370,00:04:52.830,甄远道心存异望 不思悔改,00:04:51.240,00:04:54.420,"Zhen Yuandao shows no remorse
for his dissenting opinion."
00:04:53.460,00:04:55.450,奴才以为该当重罚,00:04:54.420,00:04:56.840,He should be punished severely.
00:05:02.840,00:05:03.790,皇上明鉴,00:05:03.760,00:05:05.240,"As Your Majesty observes,"
00:05:04.380,00:05:07.290,甄远道不臣之心显而易见,00:05:05.460,00:05:08.380,Zhen Yuandao's disloyalty is obvious.
00:05:07.970,00:05:10.460,但臣想莞嫔娘娘有孕,00:05:08.860,00:05:11.960,"However, given that Her Highness
Concubine Souire is pregnant,"
00:05:11.220,00:05:13.180,若皇上真想处置甄远道,00:05:12.000,00:05:14.538,"If Your Majesty wants to punish Zhen Yuandao,"
00:05:13.890,00:05:16.350,也宜推后慢慢处置,00:05:14.538,00:05:17.334,it should be postponed and carried out in stages.
00:05:16.650,00:05:17.300,皇上,00:05:17.556,00:05:18.882,"Your Majesty,"
00:05:18.480,00:05:20.720,甄远道身为莞嫔娘娘之父,00:05:19.260,00:05:21.780,Zhen Yuandao is the father of Concubine Sourire.
00:05:21.650,00:05:23.140,不该自恃为外戚,00:05:22.360,00:05:24.440,But he should not consider himself an imperial in-law.
00:05:23.740,00:05:27.690,攀附隆恩 恃宠为傲 肆意犯上,00:05:24.600,00:05:29.220,"He should not be arrogant about Your Majesty’s
benevolence and disobey Your Majesty."
00:05:28.370,00:05:31.450,若因其女为后宫嫔妃便宽纵的话,,,
00:05:31.700,00:05:33.570,那朝中便无纲纪可言了,00:05:29.280,00:05:35.260,"If he is exempted because his daughter is a concubine,
there will be no justice and discipline in the court."
00:05:36.410,00:05:40.500,天子犯法与庶民同罪,00:05:37.520,00:05:41.620,"“If an emperor breaks the law,
he is punished the same as a commoner.”"
00:05:51.180,00:05:54.140,甄远道革职收监,00:05:52.160,00:05:55.735,Zhen Yuandao will be suspended and imprisoned.
00:05:56.180,00:05:58.140,其家眷圈禁府中,00:05:57.511,00:06:00.000,His family will be confined in their residence.
00:06:03.280,00:06:07.990,臣谢皇上隆恩,00:06:04.200,00:06:05.565,I ...
,,,00:06:06.719,00:06:09.480,humbly thank Your Majesty.
00:06:12.620,00:06:14.650,槿汐今日是重阳,00:06:13.400,00:06:15.440,"Jinxi, today is Double Ninth Festival."
00:06:15.540,00:06:18.320,按例是要向太后献上表礼敬贺的,00:06:16.417,00:06:19.797,"We should present the Empress Dowager
with gifts and our best wishes."
00:06:19.000,00:06:20.790,我让你准备的菊花糕和菊花酒,00:06:19.797,00:06:21.800,I asked you to prepare chrysanthemum cakes and wine.
00:06:21.040,00:06:21.750,都备好了吗,,,
00:06:22.130,00:06:23.040,早都准备好了,00:06:21.840,00:06:22.780,Are they ready?
00:06:23.550,00:06:25.460,奴婢还加了一个茱萸香袋,00:06:22.980,00:06:27.500,"Yes. I also included a cherry dogwood
sachet tied with a red ribbon."
00:06:25.760,00:06:26.740,用红丝带系着,,,
00:06:27.010,00:06:28.540,加上了桑叶和榆叶复盖,,,
00:06:28.880,00:06:30.000,做成三色礼品,00:06:27.840,00:06:31.080,"And I covered it with mulberry and elm
leaves to make it a three-color gift."
00:06:30.510,00:06:33.470,一大早便让芳若姑姑奉给太后了,00:06:31.540,00:06:34.920,Madam Orchid sent it to Her Majesty early this morning.
00:06:34.060,00:06:36.340,恭贺太后桑榆晚景之乐,,,
00:06:36.850,00:06:38.010,这是最好不过的,00:06:34.920,00:06:39.660,"This conveys “sunset on mulberry and elm
trees” to wish Her Majesty happiness."
00:06:43.860,00:06:45.060,莞嫔娘娘吉祥,,,
00:06:45.280,00:06:46.390,姑姑怎么亲自来了,00:06:44.620,00:06:46.040,Peace to Your Highness.
00:06:46.780,00:06:48.270,太后收到娘娘的贺礼,00:06:46.140,00:06:47.498,"Why do you come in person, Madam?"
00:06:48.780,00:06:50.060,心里高兴得很,00:06:47.720,00:06:52.627,"Her Majesty is very delighted with your presents
and is thinking about your pregnancy."
00:06:50.360,00:06:51.820,又挂念着娘娘的身孕,,,
00:06:52.120,00:06:54.150,特叫奴婢前来问候娘娘,00:06:52.920,00:06:55.218,So she sent me to deliver her greetings.
00:06:54.780,00:06:55.940,多谢太后挂心,,,
00:06:56.410,00:06:57.530,娘娘有着身子,00:06:55.540,00:06:56.980,I’m thankful for Her Majesty’s consideration.
00:06:58.000,00:06:59.610,现在实在是受委屈了,00:06:57.280,00:07:00.620,"Now that Your Highness is pregnant,
the confinement must be hard for you."
00:07:00.000,00:07:01.240,若有什么不便之处,,,
00:07:01.670,00:07:03.250,可叫芳若告诉奴婢,00:07:00.740,00:07:04.520,"If there is anything that inconveniences
Your Highness, please have Orchid tell me."
00:07:03.540,00:07:05.910,奴婢愿意为娘娘尽心尽力,00:07:04.640,00:07:06.980,"I am happy to serve Your Highness
to the best of my ability."
00:07:06.380,00:07:07.210,也没什么,,,
00:07:07.880,00:07:09.120,只是今日是重阳,00:07:07.300,00:07:08.600,There is nothing important.
00:07:09.800,00:07:11.260,遥知兄弟登高处,00:07:08.880,00:07:10.640,It’s just that today is the Double Ninth.
00:07:11.640,00:07:12.970,遍插茱萸少一人,00:07:10.660,00:07:14.080,"""I imagine my brothers climbing up to the highlands.
They would have dogwood sprigs attached and my absence noted."""
00:07:13.720,00:07:16.760,本宫就是有些思念家人了,00:07:14.780,00:07:15.976,It’s only ...
00:07:18.220,00:07:19.210,宫里的规矩,00:07:15.976,00:07:18.146,that I'm missing my family.
00:07:19.680,00:07:21.350,小主怀孕八个月时,00:07:19.120,00:07:20.831,There is a rule in the harem.
00:07:21.690,00:07:24.300,可让娘家的亲人入宫陪伴生产,00:07:20.831,00:07:22.668,"When a concubine is eight months pregnant,"
00:07:25.270,00:07:27.140,算算日子也快到了,00:07:22.668,00:07:25.742,her family is allowed to accompany her until labor.
00:07:27.650,00:07:29.610,奴婢会记得提醒内务府,00:07:26.146,00:07:28.562,We’re very close to that time.
00:07:29.950,00:07:31.560,安排娘娘的母亲进宫,00:07:28.562,00:07:32.760,"I will remind the Household Department to
arrange for Your Highness's mother to visit."
00:07:32.110,00:07:33.520,本宫虽见罪于皇上,00:07:32.980,00:07:34.642,"Although I offended/displeased His Majesty,"
00:07:34.070,00:07:36.610,但家中并未因此而受牵连,,,
00:07:36.950,00:07:38.030,本宫便安心了,00:07:34.864,00:07:39.069,I feel reassured that my family was not implicated.
00:07:40.080,00:07:41.790,太后宫中还有差事,,,
00:07:42.120,00:07:43.360,奴婢不便久留,00:07:41.082,00:07:44.580,"I have duties to Her Majesty, so I can’t stay long."
00:07:43.920,00:07:45.080,我先告退了,00:07:44.802,00:07:46.462,I will take my leave.
00:07:45.880,00:07:49.590,多谢姑姑只是本宫不能相送了,00:07:46.720,00:07:48.125,"Thank you, Madam."
,,,00:07:48.125,00:07:50.554,"Regretfully, I can’t see you off."
00:07:50.510,00:07:51.460,娘娘保重,00:07:51.360,00:07:53.098,"Take care, Your Highness."
00:08:01.730,00:08:03.390,莞嫔娘娘没有多疑吧,00:08:02.560,00:08:04.480,"Her Highness didn’t suspect anything, did she?"
00:08:03.900,00:08:06.600,太后恩典想必娘娘不会多疑,00:08:04.780,00:08:07.800,"I came with Her Majesty’s well-wishes.
I don’t think Her Highness would be suspicious."
00:08:07.070,00:08:08.600,阿弥陀佛阿弥陀佛,00:08:08.000,00:08:09.440,Thanks Amitābha Buddha.
00:08:08.940,00:08:10.150,总算应付过去了,00:08:09.860,00:08:11.320,This is properly dealt with.
00:08:10.990,00:08:12.690,你说怎么这么不巧啊,00:08:11.771,00:08:14.191,How could this happen all of a sudden?
00:08:13.200,00:08:14.150,我今天一大早,,,
00:08:14.490,00:08:17.070,来给太后送皇上的重阳节贺仪,00:08:14.191,00:08:18.540,"When I went sent His Majesty’s Double
Ninth gifts to Her Majesty this morning,"
00:08:17.700,00:08:19.910,不承想被太后派了差事,,,
00:08:20.200,00:08:21.030,来回娘娘的话,00:08:18.700,00:08:22.280,"I didn't expect Her Majesty would send
me to visit Her Highness."
00:08:21.790,00:08:24.330,我一大早啊就知道甄府出事了,,,
00:08:24.540,00:08:25.370,心里乱得很,00:08:22.500,00:08:26.520,"I knew since early morning about the
Zhen family's incident, which unsettles me."
00:08:25.710,00:08:27.200,怎么敢来面见娘娘啊,00:08:26.520,00:08:28.393,How could I face Her Highness myself?
00:08:27.880,00:08:29.790,所以只好劳烦姑姑了,00:08:28.880,00:08:30.880,"So I had to trouble you, Madam."
00:08:30.590,00:08:33.130,这瞒得了一时 瞒不了一世,00:08:31.200,00:08:34.120,"We can hide it for the moment, but not forever."
00:08:33.630,00:08:34.920,娘娘的月份大了,,,
00:08:35.300,00:08:36.760,断不能知道这件事,00:08:34.440,00:08:37.780,"Her Highness is due soon.
She can’t know about this."
00:08:36.970,00:08:39.050,否则伤了胎气可怎么好,00:08:37.780,00:08:39.940,What if her prenatal qi is affected?
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.550,是啊我也是这么想,00:08:40.420,00:08:42.798,That's also what I was thinking.
00:08:42.980,00:08:45.810,幸好甄府的事还没有定论,00:08:43.880,00:08:46.800,"Fortunately, no final conviction
has been made of the Zhen family."
00:08:46.400,00:08:49.010,或许皇上会看在娘娘的份儿上,,,
00:08:49.270,00:08:50.310,格外开恩吧,00:08:47.510,00:08:51.624,"Perhaps His Majesty will have mercy
on account of Her Highness."
00:08:51.690,00:08:53.600,这不是咱们该操心的事,00:08:52.520,00:08:54.760,This isn’t what we should worry about.
00:08:54.150,00:08:56.190,咱们回吧走吧,00:08:54.920,00:08:57.380,Let’s go back.
00:08:56.910,00:08:58.070,一向都是芳若来的,00:08:57.800,00:08:59.522,It’s always been Madam Orchid coming here.
00:08:58.990,00:09:00.530,今日怎么换成孙姑姑了,00:09:00.000,00:09:01.913,How come it was Madam Bamboo today?
00:09:02.660,00:09:04.150,许是小主送的贺礼,,,
00:09:04.460,00:09:05.410,很受太后的喜欢,00:09:03.560,00:09:06.700,Perhaps Her Majesty likes your gifts very much.
00:09:05.790,00:09:07.950,让孙姑姑来更显得体面些,00:09:06.700,00:09:09.260,So she’s sent Madam Bamboo to show more respect.
00:09:09.250,00:09:11.290,你不觉得孙姑姑神情怪怪的吗,00:09:10.100,00:09:12.920,Don’t you think Madam Bamboo was acting strangely?
00:09:14.670,00:09:15.750,小主不要多想,00:09:15.620,00:09:17.100,"Don’t overthink it, My Lady."
00:09:16.720,00:09:18.210,该是吃安胎药的时候了,00:09:17.500,00:09:19.400,It’s time to take your prenatal tonic.
00:09:18.890,00:09:19.800,奴婢去拿药,00:09:19.738,00:09:21.118,I’ll go bring it.
00:09:26.690,00:09:28.930,这东阿阿胶羹炖了三个时辰,00:09:27.420,00:09:30.120,This Dong'e ejiao soup has been simmered for six hours.
00:09:29.440,00:09:30.350,入口即融,,,
00:09:30.650,00:09:31.730,皇额娘喜欢吗,00:09:30.380,00:09:31.620,It melts in your mouth.
,,,00:09:31.720,00:09:33.140,"Do you like it, Imperial Mother?"
00:09:33.110,00:09:36.600,很好香甜软糯,00:09:33.838,00:09:37.380,"It’s very good, sweet and glutinous."
00:09:37.110,00:09:38.520,皇额娘喜欢就好,00:09:38.038,00:09:39.898,"I'm glad you like it, Imperial Mother."
00:09:39.030,00:09:43.150,人家说吃甜食会让人心情愉悦,00:09:39.960,00:09:44.240,"People say that sweet foods bring
happiness to your heart."
00:09:44.870,00:09:46.580,可是哀家吃了这羹,00:09:45.828,00:09:47.646,"However,"
00:09:47.920,00:09:49.500,还是食不知味,00:09:48.445,00:09:51.086,I can barely taste the sweetness in the soup.
00:09:51.960,00:09:55.750,听说有言官替甄远道求情,00:09:52.800,00:09:57.141,"I heard an official spoken out
in favor of Zhen Yuandao."
00:09:56.550,00:09:59.630,皇帝迁怒于他也下了刑部大牢,00:09:57.496,00:10:00.935,"It enraged the Emperor, and he was also
imprisoned at the Ministry of Justice."
00:10:00.220,00:10:01.080,是这样的,00:10:01.100,00:10:02.340,That’s true.
00:10:02.180,00:10:06.590,前朝风波叠起 后宫也不得安宁,00:10:03.120,00:10:07.407,"The court is turbulent,
and the harem is not peaceful."
00:10:08.100,00:10:09.090,臣妾无能,00:10:08.840,00:10:10.318,I am incapable.
00:10:11.480,00:10:12.600,不是你无能,00:10:12.400,00:10:13.920,It’s not that you’re incapable.
00:10:13.480,00:10:16.690,是你的确比纯元聪明能干了许多,00:10:14.420,00:10:17.780,"You are smarter and more capable
than Empress Première."
00:10:18.400,00:10:22.570,这些年如何当福晋如何当皇后,00:10:19.220,00:10:22.070,"All these years, I have never interfered"
00:10:23.540,00:10:25.200,哀家从来不干涉你,00:10:22.070,00:10:26.294,"in how you carry out the role of
a Lady and then an Empress."
00:10:26.250,00:10:27.410,只是有一条,00:10:27.180,00:10:28.749,"But, there is one thing."
00:10:28.410,00:10:30.280,后宫皇嗣为重,00:10:29.180,00:10:31.698,The Imperial Harem is centered on heirs.
00:10:32.340,00:10:35.290,宫里的女人就像是开不尽的花,00:10:33.120,00:10:36.760,"The women in the harem are like
an endless procession of flowers."
00:10:36.340,00:10:38.170,你费心除掉一个,,,
00:10:38.590,00:10:40.050,还会有下一个进来,00:10:37.280,00:10:41.140,"While you take the effort to remove one,
there will be another coming in."
00:10:41.390,00:10:44.470,身为皇后是要掌管群花,00:10:42.220,00:10:45.700,"As the Empress, you are to manage the flowers"
00:10:44.970,00:10:46.590,而不是一味地修剪,,,
00:10:46.890,00:10:48.260,终致花叶凋零,00:10:45.700,00:10:49.369,"rather than constantly trimming them,
resulting in a bare tree."
00:10:49.270,00:10:50.180,更有一件,00:10:50.080,00:10:51.897,"Moreover,"
00:10:51.400,00:10:54.480,无论如何不能折损了皇嗣,00:10:52.208,00:10:55.811,you can’t under any circumstances harm the heirs.
00:10:56.480,00:10:58.770,自从臣妾的大阿哥没有了之后,00:10:57.460,00:11:00.000,"Ever since I lost the First Prince,"
00:10:59.650,00:11:02.070,一直希望皇上后继有人,00:11:00.457,00:11:03.891,"I've always been hoping His Majesty
will have a desirable heir to his throne."
00:11:02.910,00:11:04.940,只是眼下虽有三位阿哥,00:11:03.891,00:11:06.110,Although His Majesty has three sons ...
00:11:05.240,00:11:06.110,三位阿哥,,,
00:11:06.540,00:11:07.900,先帝有多少儿子,00:11:06.110,00:11:07.498,Only three sons!
,,,00:11:07.498,00:11:09.501,How many did the prior emperor have?
00:11:09.000,00:11:11.160,皇帝连先帝的零头都没有,00:11:09.812,00:11:12.404,Even the last digit is larger than three!
00:11:12.670,00:11:15.830,后嗣稀少也是中宫失德,00:11:13.513,00:11:16.895,"A lack of imperial heirs is the
lack of virtue of the Empress."
00:11:17.210,00:11:18.790,你去螽斯门站一会儿,00:11:17.920,00:11:20.000,Go stand in front of the Cricket Gate.
00:11:20.180,00:11:22.540,好好想想哀家的苦心吧,00:11:21.280,00:11:23.951,And reflect on what I just said.
00:11:25.640,00:11:26.340,是,00:11:26.484,00:11:27.672,Yes.
00:11:43.910,00:11:45.740,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:11:44.887,00:11:47.383,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:11:50.250,00:11:54.410,娘娘这时候风大还是先回宫,00:11:50.960,00:11:55.520,"It's windy right now.
Your Majesty should return to your palace."
00:11:55.710,00:12:00.000,安嫔你可知道螽斯门的意思,00:11:56.509,00:12:00.799,"Concubine An, do you know the
meaning behind the Cricket Gate?"
00:12:01.010,00:12:03.590,臣妾不知还请娘娘赐教,00:12:01.898,00:12:04.478,"I do not. I hope Your Majesty
would enlighten me."
00:12:04.430,00:12:05.510,诗经有谓,00:12:05.233,00:12:06.842,"In the Classic of Poetry,"
00:12:06.390,00:12:11.430,螽斯羽宜尔子孙名为螽斯,00:12:07.248,00:12:11.578,"“Ye winged crickets, how you cluster together!
Right is it that your descendants - should be in swarms!”"
00:12:11.680,00:12:13.720,意在祈盼皇室多子多孙,00:12:11.578,00:12:15.068,"This name for the gate wishes the
imperial family may have many heirs"
00:12:14.480,00:12:15.690,帝柞永延,00:12:15.246,00:12:17.344,to continue the imperial rule through generations.
00:12:17.520,00:12:19.760,本宫真的很希望有自己的阿哥,00:12:18.542,00:12:21.315,I really wish I had a son of my own.
00:12:20.820,00:12:23.430,本宫的大阿哥已经会说会笑了,00:12:21.619,00:12:24.640,"The First Prince was already
able to talk and laugh."
00:12:23.910,00:12:25.490,可偏偏一场风疾,00:12:24.818,00:12:26.979,But a sudden disease ...
00:12:26.410,00:12:28.270,让他死在了本宫的怀中,00:12:27.379,00:12:29.822,took away his life right from my arms.
00:12:30.410,00:12:32.320,如今本宫看着宫里头,,,
00:12:32.750,00:12:34.740,一个一个的肚子大起来,00:12:31.431,00:12:35.520,"Now I have to watch the concubines
getting pregnant one after another,"
00:12:36.130,00:12:38.240,一个一个孩子落地,00:12:36.938,00:12:39.520,and one child born after another...
00:12:41.670,00:12:44.510,你叫本宫情何以堪,00:12:42.735,00:12:45.930,How can I endure it emotionally?
00:12:46.470,00:12:49.550,娘娘您不喜欢的孩子,00:12:47.402,00:12:48.679,"Your Majesty,"
00:12:50.390,00:12:52.180,就不该活到这个世上来,00:12:49.212,00:12:53.411,"children not favored by you
don't deserve to be born to this world."
00:12:53.100,00:12:53.970,不为别的,,,
00:12:54.600,00:12:56.470,就为您是天下人之母,00:12:54.073,00:12:57.706,"Solely because you are the ""Mother of the Nation."""
00:12:57.560,00:13:00.600,也同样您不喜欢的女人,00:12:58.537,00:13:01.937,"Likewise, women not favored by Your Majesty"
00:13:01.730,00:13:03.600,也不该活着让您生厌,00:13:02.781,00:13:05.573,shouldn't live to disgust you either.
00:13:13.160,00:13:15.780,所以本宫喜欢你,00:13:14.124,00:13:16.922,That's why I favor you.
00:13:18.460,00:13:19.200,娘娘,00:13:18.934,00:13:20.474,Your Majesty.
00:13:19.750,00:13:21.790,莞嫔的胎已经八个月了,00:13:20.652,00:13:23.211,Concubine Sourire is already eight months pregnant
00:13:22.670,00:13:23.710,就要临盆,00:13:23.360,00:13:24.925,and about to give birth.
00:13:25.550,00:13:27.170,临盆是一件好事,00:13:26.394,00:13:28.414,Giving birth is a good thing.
00:13:28.260,00:13:30.250,本宫的一桩责任也算了了,00:13:28.970,00:13:31.670,I will have one responsibility off my shoulder.
00:13:31.600,00:13:34.460,可怜莞嫔月份这么大了,00:13:32.444,00:13:35.570,"It's a pity Concubine Sourire is already
so late into her pregnancy."
00:13:34.980,00:13:37.890,她若是知道家里发生了事,00:13:36.014,00:13:39.040,"If she was to learn about
what happened to her family,"
00:13:39.150,00:13:40.760,还不定怎么伤心呢,00:13:40.000,00:13:42.320,who knows how saddened she would be.
00:13:43.940,00:13:46.030,还是叫太医好生照看着,00:13:44.818,00:13:47.274,The doctor must take good care of her
00:13:46.740,00:13:49.150,万万不能走漏了消息啊,00:13:47.584,00:13:50.462,and no one shall let the word get out to her.
00:13:49.820,00:13:50.780,臣妾谨记,00:13:50.841,00:13:52.955,I will obey Your Majesty's order.
00:13:53.120,00:13:55.950,娘娘臣妾先陪您回宫吧,00:13:54.008,00:13:57.282,"Your Majesty, allow me to
accompany you back to your palace."
00:13:56.960,00:13:57.700,不用了,00:13:57.700,00:13:59.150,There's no need.
00:13:58.500,00:14:01.290,皇上现在应该午睡刚起来,00:13:59.344,00:14:02.533,"His Majesty should have just
awoken from his afternoon nap."
00:14:01.840,00:14:04.670,你也应该回去服侍左右了,00:14:02.800,00:14:05.869,You should go back and serve by his side.
00:14:06.300,00:14:08.010,臣妾多谢娘娘提点,00:14:07.232,00:14:09.519,I am thankful for Your Majesty's advice.
00:14:10.390,00:14:11.130,去吧,00:14:11.130,00:14:12.403,Go.
00:14:22.610,00:14:24.270,本宫身孕已经八个月了,00:14:23.365,00:14:25.630,I'm already eight months pregnant.
00:14:25.230,00:14:26.350,这内务府怎么还没有,,,
00:14:26.690,00:14:27.680,安排母亲入宫呢,00:14:26.163,00:14:29.103,"Why hasn't the Household Department
arranged for my mother to visit?"
00:14:28.820,00:14:30.060,上午芳若姑姑过来,,,
00:14:30.410,00:14:32.400,也是支支吾吾的没个准话,00:14:29.708,00:14:33.600,"When Madam Orchid visited this morning,
she was also ambiguous with her words."
00:14:33.830,00:14:35.190,上次苏培盛来传话,,,
00:14:35.700,00:14:37.860,说什么近日天气凉,00:14:34.895,00:14:37.653,"The last time Su Peisheng came,
he passed the words"
00:14:38.410,00:14:39.870,叮嘱我别出去散心,00:14:37.653,00:14:40.961,"that I should avoid going out
for walks due to the cold weather."
00:14:40.500,00:14:42.120,都是为小主的身子着想,00:14:41.344,00:14:43.585,"My Lady, they are just thinking about your health."
00:14:42.920,00:14:44.780,芳若姑姑也是御前的人,00:14:43.808,00:14:46.246,Madam Orchid is a direct servant to His Majesty.
00:14:45.250,00:14:46.790,请小主的母家来宫里,,,
00:14:47.090,00:14:48.170,那是内务府的事,00:14:46.246,00:14:49.543,"But the Household Department is
responsible for arranging your family's visit."
00:14:49.130,00:14:50.670,兴许这芳若姑姑,,,
00:14:50.970,00:14:52.500,一时半会儿还没有问到呢,00:14:50.000,00:14:53.849,"Madam Orchid probably has not
had the chance to ask about it yet."
00:14:54.470,00:14:56.460,这几日我总觉得心里不安静,00:14:55.269,00:14:58.102,"For the past few days, I've been feeling disquieted."
00:14:58.270,00:15:00.010,你看这碎玉轩看守的太监,00:14:59.114,00:15:01.342,Just look at all the eunuchs guarding my palace.
00:15:00.560,00:15:01.800,人都多了好几拨,,,
00:15:02.230,00:15:03.310,小主快临盆了,00:15:01.342,00:15:03.176,The numbers have increased many folds.
00:15:03.730,00:15:05.770,他们谨慎些也是应该的,00:15:03.176,00:15:04.820,"My Lady, you're about to give birth."
,,,00:15:04.820,00:15:07.013,It's normal for them to be more cautious.
00:15:07.440,00:15:10.650,也罢孩子快出世了,00:15:08.195,00:15:09.484,All right then.
00:15:11.660,00:15:12.650,到时候天气凉,00:15:10.239,00:15:11.793,My child will be born soon.
00:15:13.490,00:15:14.950,我想给他多缝几床被子,00:15:12.415,00:15:14.334,"By then, the weather would be cold."
00:15:15.240,00:15:17.110,好啊 奴碑陪你一起做,00:15:14.334,00:15:16.149,I want to sew some more quilts for him.
,,,00:15:16.149,00:15:18.309,"Good idea, My Lady.
Allow me to help you."
00:15:17.410,00:15:19.240,那些针线活小主都不用做,00:15:18.309,00:15:20.483,"My Lady, you don't have to do any of the needlework."
00:15:19.790,00:15:21.750,那些还是交给奴婢来做吧,00:15:20.706,00:15:22.683,Leave that to me.
00:15:22.500,00:15:23.710,那我就来扯棉花吧,00:15:23.299,00:15:25.264,All right. I will pull the cotton then.
00:15:29.510,00:15:31.290,奴才给莞嫔娘娘请安,00:15:30.311,00:15:32.446,Peace to Your Highness.
00:15:31.970,00:15:33.000,娘娘就要临盆,,,
00:15:33.550,00:15:34.340,内务府让奴才,00:15:32.810,00:15:34.284,Your Highness's due date is near.
00:15:34.640,00:15:36.220,送干清宫的易崖石给娘娘,00:15:34.506,00:15:37.492,"The Household Department has ordered
me to deliver the Easy Labor Stones"
00:15:36.510,00:15:38.760,保佑娘娘生产顺利 母子平安,00:15:37.492,00:15:40.000,to protect Your Highness and your child.
00:15:40.310,00:15:42.890,你叫什么怎么从来没有见过你,00:15:40.931,00:15:44.132,"What's your name?
I've never met you before."
00:15:43.730,00:15:45.390,奴才小贵子是新来的,00:15:44.631,00:15:47.135,"Your Highness, my name is Xiao-Guizi
and I am new to the palace."
00:15:45.690,00:15:47.770,本来今天应该是黄大哥过来,00:15:47.135,00:15:49.431,"Mr. Huang was supposed to come today,"
00:15:48.480,00:15:51.150,可是他忽然肚子疼就换了奴才,00:15:49.431,00:15:52.498,but he had a stomach ache and sent me instead.
00:15:55.240,00:15:56.820,这些钱算是我家小主,,,
00:15:57.160,00:15:57.990,赏你喝茶用的,00:15:56.217,00:15:59.336,My Lady would like to treat you to a cup of tea.
00:15:58.490,00:15:59.280,谢娘娘,,,
00:16:00.120,00:16:00.860,这算什么,00:15:59.336,00:16:00.659,I thank Your Highness.
00:16:01.580,00:16:03.290,等本宫家里人进宫那一日,00:16:00.860,00:16:02.215,This is just a small reward.
00:16:03.830,00:16:05.040,本宫再好好打赏你,00:16:02.482,00:16:04.356,"Once my family comes to visit me,"
00:16:05.460,00:16:06.250,谢娘娘赏,00:16:04.685,00:16:06.124,I will reward you more.
00:16:07.880,00:16:10.750,可近日奴才没听公公们说,00:16:06.392,00:16:07.759,I thank Your Highness.
00:16:11.050,00:16:12.410,哪位夫人要进宫啊,00:16:08.768,00:16:13.502,"But I haven't heard about
arranging any noblewomen to visit."
00:16:12.930,00:16:15.880,不知娘娘娘家大人在哪里高就啊,00:16:13.818,00:16:17.123,"May I ask which distinguished family
Your Highness is from?"
00:16:17.640,00:16:20.680,本宫娘家远不是什么显赫人家,00:16:18.351,00:16:21.790,I do not come from a prestigious family.
00:16:22.520,00:16:25.430,比不了像甄府夫人那样常能入宫,00:16:23.142,00:16:26.451,"Unlike the Zhen family, my mother
cannot frequent the palace."
00:16:25.940,00:16:27.890,只是这甄府往日里风光,00:16:26.642,00:16:28.924,"Although the Zhen family was once prominent,"
00:16:28.190,00:16:28.980,如今也不行了,,,
00:16:29.650,00:16:31.020,前两天奴才还听说,00:16:28.924,00:16:30.266,they have fallen now.
,,,00:16:30.488,00:16:32.302,I just heard a few days ago
00:16:31.570,00:16:33.150,甄大人给下大狱了,00:16:32.302,00:16:34.171,that Mr. Zhen was imprisoned.
00:16:34.200,00:16:37.160,一大把年纪给禁在牢里,00:16:34.910,00:16:38.570,"Not only was he imprisoned at an old age,"
00:16:37.490,00:16:38.570,而且还牵连了好几位,,,
00:16:38.870,00:16:40.030,为他进言的言官,00:16:38.570,00:16:41.401,"but the officials that argued for
him were also implicated."
00:16:40.910,00:16:41.870,怎么会这样,00:16:41.648,00:16:43.355,How could this happen?
00:16:43.000,00:16:45.280,甄府不是在平定,00:16:43.577,00:16:45.857,Didn't the Zhen family
00:16:45.540,00:16:47.660,年羹尧和敦亲王时立了大功吗,00:16:45.857,00:16:48.592,"accomplish a great feat for quelling
Nian Gengyao and State Prince Dun?"
00:16:48.000,00:16:49.080,娘娘有所不知,,,
00:16:49.380,00:16:50.830,这立了大功也犯了大罪,00:16:48.843,00:16:51.885,"Your Highness, they have also
committed a major crime."
00:16:51.130,00:16:52.920,想当初那年家不就是个例子吗,00:16:51.885,00:16:54.341,The Nian family was a great example.
00:16:55.640,00:16:57.670,甄大人是让人告发的,00:16:56.351,00:16:58.738,Someone informed against Mr. Zhen.
00:16:58.220,00:17:01.340,被谁告发的你快说呀,00:16:59.064,00:17:00.312,Who did it?
00:17:02.730,00:17:04.090,是鄂敏大人,00:17:01.555,00:17:03.161,Tell us!
00:17:04.310,00:17:04.920,胡说,00:17:03.326,00:17:05.970,"- It was Mr. Gūwalgiya.
- Nonsense!"
00:17:05.730,00:17:06.470,鄂敏大人不是一向,,,
00:17:06.850,00:17:07.760,和甄大人交好吗,00:17:06.680,00:17:09.069,Wasn't Mr. Gūwalgiya always close with Mr. Zhen?
00:17:08.060,00:17:09.300,他怎么会告发甄大人呢,,,
00:17:10.360,00:17:11.390,这官场上的事,00:17:09.069,00:17:10.715,Why would he inform against Mr. Zhen?
00:17:11.730,00:17:13.070,奴才哪里知道得清楚啊,00:17:11.346,00:17:14.241,"I wouldn't know much about the
happenings in court."
00:17:13.740,00:17:15.730,不过这事人人知道啊,00:17:14.623,00:17:16.918,But this matter has been known to everyone.
00:17:16.030,00:17:17.320,奴才可不敢瞎说,00:17:16.918,00:17:18.741,I wouldn't dare lie about this.
00:17:20.580,00:17:22.530,奴才还有别的差事,00:17:21.246,00:17:23.773,I still have other tasks to attend to.
00:17:23.290,00:17:25.820,先先告退了告退了,00:17:23.773,00:17:26.925,Allow... Allow me to take my leave.
00:17:28.290,00:17:31.500,小主这该如何是好,00:17:29.318,00:17:32.540,"My Lady, what should we do?"
00:17:31.880,00:17:32.540,小主,00:17:32.540,00:17:33.792,My Lady...
00:17:33.170,00:17:36.340,好好,00:17:33.792,00:17:36.769,Very well... Very well...
00:17:36.840,00:17:38.460,小主小主,00:17:37.628,00:17:39.437,My Lady! My Lady!
00:17:38.800,00:17:39.630,小主怕是动了胎气,,,
00:17:40.010,00:17:41.420,快快去请温太医,00:17:39.437,00:17:41.096,Her prenatal qi must have been affected.
,,,00:17:41.096,00:17:43.018,Hurry! Send for Dr. Wen.
00:17:46.270,00:17:47.510,奴才给小主请安,00:17:46.670,00:17:48.868,"Peace to you, My Lady."
00:17:48.690,00:17:50.680,要你办的事情都办妥了吗,00:17:49.445,00:17:51.701,Have you done your task well?
00:17:51.400,00:17:52.010,办妥了,,,
00:17:52.320,00:17:53.100,按小主的盼咐,00:17:52.010,00:17:54.200,"Yes, My Lady. Just as you have ordered."
00:17:53.440,00:17:55.310,奴才刚听到里头叫太医呢,00:17:54.239,00:17:56.808,I heard they were calling for the imperial doctors.
00:17:56.200,00:17:56.900,很好,,,
00:17:57.860,00:18:00.150,接下来她有没有福气,00:17:57.042,00:17:58.410,Well done.
00:18:00.660,00:18:01.990,就看她自己的造化了,00:17:58.659,00:18:03.058,What happens next will be up to her own fortune.
00:18:03.200,00:18:04.490,你再替我办一件事,00:18:04.088,00:18:05.556,I have another task for you.
00:18:04.870,00:18:05.780,听小主的盼咐,00:18:05.556,00:18:07.090,"I await your order, My Lady."
00:18:07.830,00:18:09.200,你去给我找一样东西,00:18:08.407,00:18:10.221,Go find something for me
00:18:09.790,00:18:11.450,直接送进刑部大牢,00:18:10.400,00:18:13.315,"and bring it directly to the prison
at the Ministry of Justice."
00:18:13.550,00:18:16.000,公公里头不干净您早些出来,00:18:14.349,00:18:17.065,"Sir, it's filthy inside. Please come out soon."
00:18:18.590,00:18:20.250,本公公还用你教,00:18:19.300,00:18:21.448,I don't need you telling me what to do.
00:18:20.640,00:18:21.800,是是是公公请便,00:18:21.448,00:18:23.265,"Yes, Sir. Please do as you wish."

00:19:40.930,00:19:41.760,大碍是没有了,00:19:41.660,00:19:43.200,Nothing serious.
00:19:42.720,00:19:45.960,只是我有些话想问问娘娘,00:19:43.378,00:19:46.943,I just have something to ask Your Highness.
00:19:46.810,00:19:48.390,本宫也有话要问温大人,00:19:47.654,00:19:50.000,"I also have some questions for you, Dr. Wen."
00:19:51.810,00:19:52.430,好,00:19:52.476,00:19:53.760,Yes.
00:19:55.820,00:19:58.100,娘娘您何故这样急痛攻心,00:19:56.435,00:19:59.736,"Your Highness, what caused you such intense pain"
00:19:58.400,00:19:59.480,以致动了胎气呢,00:19:59.736,00:20:01.610,to even affect your prenatal qi?

 what happened to my family."

00:20:08.040,00:20:09.370,想必一清二楚吧,00:20:08.658,00:20:10.417,you must have known about it.
00:20:09.660,00:20:10.570,娘娘全知道了吗,00:20:10.417,00:20:12.491,Has Your Highness known all about it?
00:20:11.710,00:20:13.290,是谁这样大胆告诉了娘娘呢,00:20:12.669,00:20:14.596,Who had the audacity to tell Your Highness?
00:20:15.000,00:20:16.290,大人果然知道,00:20:15.799,00:20:17.755,So you really know.
00:20:20.380,00:20:21.620,即便本宫不问,00:20:21.313,00:20:23.308,"Even if I don't ask,"
00:20:22.880,00:20:25.170,也会有人想方设法让本宫知道,00:20:23.635,00:20:26.600,someone will find ways to let me know.
00:20:26.600,00:20:28.090,一则是受皇上嘱托,00:20:27.399,00:20:29.511,"For one thing, I am entrusted by His Majesty."
00:20:28.810,00:20:30.220,二则微臣必须要顾及,00:20:29.511,00:20:31.420,"For another, I have to consider"

Mr. Zhen showed sympathy for the traitor."
00:21:08.890,00:21:12.470,同情逆贼何出此言,00:21:09.701,00:21:11.577,Showed sympathy for the traitor?
,,,00:21:12.244,00:21:13.945,How could he say so?
00:21:13.730,00:21:16.060,娘娘您还记得钱名世之事吗,00:21:14.433,00:21:17.144,Does Your Highness remember Qian Mingshi?
00:21:17.270,00:21:18.850,甄伯父不肯随波逐流,,,
00:21:19.110,00:21:20.890,作诗去谴责钱名世,00:21:17.943,00:21:22.177,"Your father refused to go with the flow
and didn't write any reprehensive poems."
00:21:21.190,00:21:22.980,被皇上认为是同情逆贼,00:21:22.177,00:21:24.554,"Then was considered by His majesty
to be sympathetic to the traitor."
00:21:24.110,00:21:27.770,这样的话可不是莫须有吗,00:21:24.909,00:21:26.574,Isn't that ...

00:21:32.830,00:21:35.190,皇上对这些功臣们都颇为介意,00:21:33.807,00:21:36.418,"His Majesty has been vigilant against
these meritorious officials"

00:21:41.800,00:21:43.130,又传出这样的谣言来,00:21:42.561,00:21:44.442,such a rumor came out.
00:21:44.220,00:21:46.080,皇上一时为了清扫逆党,00:21:45.064,00:21:47.120,"In order to clean up opposing factions,"
00:21:46.510,00:21:47.620,因而十分介怀,00:21:47.120,00:21:49.085,His Majesty was very concerned about such a rumor.
00:21:48.680,00:21:50.040,所以皇上信了,00:21:49.618,00:21:51.294,So His Majesty believed it?
00:21:50.850,00:21:51.930,瓜尔佳鄂敏的告发,,,
00:21:52.220,00:21:53.960,句句都犯在皇上的大忌上,00:21:51.472,00:21:55.000,"Every word on Gūwalgiya Emin's report
broke the taboo of His Majesty."
00:21:54.350,00:21:55.390,皇上能不信吗,00:21:55.061,00:21:56.722,How could His Majesty not believe it?
00:21:57.690,00:22:00.100,鸟尽弓藏 兔死狗烹,00:21:58.400,00:22:01.220,"“After the cunning hare is killed,
the hound is boiled.”"
00:22:00.860,00:22:01.720,何止是我,00:22:01.576,00:22:03.040,Not only me...
00:22:02.900,00:22:04.890,连整个甄家都被人算计了,00:22:03.497,00:22:06.266,My whole family has been plotted against.
00:22:05.780,00:22:07.480,小主不对呀,00:22:06.488,00:22:07.702,"No, My Lady..."
00:22:08.200,00:22:09.110,那个小贵子说,00:22:07.711,00:22:09.188,Xiao-Guizi said that
00:22:09.410,00:22:10.570,自己新到内务府不久,00:22:09.188,00:22:11.474,he was new to the palace.
00:22:11.030,00:22:12.320,不知道小主家姓甄,,,
00:22:12.910,00:22:13.700,那怎么咱们家的事,00:22:11.740,00:22:13.700,He didn't know your family name is Zhen.
00:22:13.990,00:22:15.110,他了解得那么清楚啊,00:22:13.700,00:22:16.480,How could he know this about our family?
00:22:15.790,00:22:17.320,你也相信他是个新来的,00:22:16.578,00:22:18.596,Do you believe he is a new comer?
00:22:19.750,00:22:21.710,既然皇上这么重视碎玉轩,00:22:20.594,00:22:22.909,His Majesty holds my palace in high regard ...
00:22:23.130,00:22:24.330,内务府又怎么会派一个,,,
00:22:24.670,00:22:26.290,什么都不知道的小太监来呢,00:22:23.840,00:22:27.437,"How could the Household Department
send a servant who knows nothing?"
00:22:28.470,00:22:30.080,分明是有人想借他的口,,,
00:22:30.340,00:22:31.250,来告诉本宫,00:22:29.406,00:22:32.480,"It's clear that someone wanted to
send me the words through his mouth."
00:22:33.140,00:22:34.970,若是本宫心志软弱一点,00:22:34.028,00:22:36.169,"If I hadn't had a strong heart,"
00:22:36.100,00:22:39.470,恐怕这个孩子就要保不住了,00:22:36.988,00:22:40.800,I'm afraid I could have lost my child.
00:22:41.520,00:22:42.810,她们好恶毒,00:22:42.186,00:22:44.097,They are so vicious.
00:22:47.280,00:22:48.560,本宫要求见皇上,00:22:47.857,00:22:49.847,I have to see His Majesty.
00:22:51.820,00:22:53.160,只是今非昔比,00:22:52.619,00:22:54.225,"But time has changed,"
00:22:55.080,00:22:56.490,皇上他未必肯见,00:22:55.790,00:22:58.080,His Majesty may not be willing to see me.
00:23:14.100,00:23:15.930,请你务必把此物和信件,00:23:14.810,00:23:17.040,Please hand this over to His Majesty
00:23:17.640,00:23:19.220,一同交到皇上手中,00:23:18.440,00:23:20.376,together with my letter.
00:23:26.570,00:23:28.730,寄予宛宛爱妻,00:23:27.147,00:23:30.320,To my beloved wife Surissé:
00:23:30.320,00:23:31.610,念悲去,00:23:30.986,00:23:33.986,My heart aches when I think of your tragic passing.
00:23:33.320,00:23:35.860,独余斯良苦此身,00:23:34.164,00:23:37.459,Leaving me behind in this sorrowful shell.
00:23:38.000,00:23:42.860,常自魂牵梦萦忧思难忘,00:23:38.710,00:23:43.925,"You lift my soul to see you in my dreams -
A yearning I can never forget."
00:23:49.920,00:23:52.260,宛宛若是你在,00:23:50.542,00:23:53.548,"Were you here with me, Surissé,"
00:23:53.970,00:23:56.050,可能体会朕今日心中,00:23:54.725,00:23:57.337,could you understand
00:23:57.060,00:23:58.720,种种为难之处吗,00:23:57.914,00:24:00.178,the dilemmas I am in.
00:24:01.480,00:24:04.890,朕知道这世间,00:24:02.413,00:24:03.641,I know that
,,,00:24:04.573,00:24:06.043,"in this world,"
00:24:06.820,00:24:10.180,唯有你懂得朕明白朕,00:24:07.575,00:24:09.778,only you can understand me.
,,,00:24:10.266,00:24:11.501,Only you can.
00:24:12.490,00:24:14.150,旁人总是不如你,00:24:13.200,00:24:15.574,No one compares to you.
00:24:18.580,00:24:19.280,皇上,00:24:19.424,00:24:20.866,"Your Majesty,"
00:24:20.080,00:24:23.070,温太医托奴才带来碎玉轩的信件,00:24:20.866,00:24:24.613,"Dr. Wen asked me to present
this letter from the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:24:41.520,00:24:43.220,小主别着急,00:24:42.364,00:24:44.550,"Don't worry, My Lady."
00:24:44.600,00:24:46.010,家中安危生死,00:24:45.349,00:24:47.413,The lives of my family
00:24:46.860,00:24:48.720,就在于皇上肯否见我了,00:24:47.724,00:24:50.372,"depend on whether His Majesty
agrees to see me or not."
00:24:56.030,00:24:57.740,小主苏公公来了,00:24:56.735,00:24:58.972,"My Lady, Mr. Su is here."
00:25:02.080,00:25:05.820,娘娘皇上请您移步养心殿,00:25:02.825,00:25:04.191,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:25:04.724,00:25:07.294,"His Majesty asks you to head over
to the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:25:06.380,00:25:08.410,公公稍候本宫即刻就去,00:25:07.294,00:25:09.760,"One moment, Mr. Su.
I'll be ready right away."
00:25:08.840,00:25:10.870,是奴才在外头候着,00:25:09.760,00:25:12.005,Yes. I'll be waiting outside.
00:25:27.520,00:25:29.760,身子不方便就不用行礼了,00:25:28.142,00:25:31.097,No need to bow when it's not convenient to.
00:25:31.860,00:25:35.520,芳若说你有了身孕之后一直多梦,00:25:32.704,00:25:36.660,"Orchid told me that you‘ve been having
dreams in your sleep in your pregnancy."
00:25:36.660,00:25:38.190,如今睡得还安稳吗,00:25:37.282,00:25:39.578,Have you been sleeping better lately?
00:25:39.870,00:25:42.070,皇上眼见臣妾多梦难安了吗,00:25:40.721,00:25:43.862,"Has Your Majesty really seen
me having unsound sleep?"
00:25:43.790,00:25:45.530,仅凭芳若姑姑一面之词,00:25:44.648,00:25:46.985,Did Your Majesty believe so
00:25:47.330,00:25:49.290,皇上就相信臣妾睡不安稳,00:25:48.040,00:25:50.444,simply because Madam Orchid said so?
00:25:50.840,00:25:52.170,而并不问一问太医,00:25:51.550,00:25:53.407,Instead of asking the doctors
00:25:53.090,00:25:54.920,是否给臣妾开了安魂散,00:25:53.984,00:25:56.024,if I was prescribed any calming medicine?
00:25:56.180,00:25:57.290,臣妾梦见了什么,00:25:56.891,00:25:59.092,Or what I dreamed about?
00:25:58.800,00:25:59.840,你想说什么,00:25:59.757,00:26:01.600,What are you implying?
00:26:01.810,00:26:02.970,臣妾只想说,00:26:02.586,00:26:04.310,I just wanted to say that
00:26:04.430,00:26:07.520,不可听信一面之词而作论断,00:26:05.185,00:26:08.805,"judgments should not be made
based on only one person's story."
00:26:08.810,00:26:10.350,那你如今睡得还好吗,00:26:09.729,00:26:12.143,"So, are you sleeping well recently?"
00:26:14.030,00:26:18.110,起初几个月的确睡得不安稳,00:26:14.918,00:26:16.662,The initial few months
00:26:19.160,00:26:20.400,如今稍稍好些了,00:26:17.727,00:26:19.280,were indeed restless.
00:26:21.660,00:26:23.150,芳若所言不虚,00:26:20.000,00:26:22.068,But it's been slightly better now.
00:26:23.740,00:26:25.610,芳若姑姑并无骗皇上的意思,00:26:22.522,00:26:24.388,What Orchid said was true.
,,,00:26:24.639,00:26:27.244,Madam Orchid has no intention to deceive Your Majesty.
00:26:26.830,00:26:30.070,但朝中臣子权力倾轧,00:26:27.644,00:26:31.281,"But the officials in court
are constantly fighting for power."
00:26:31.630,00:26:33.410,并非人人都能坦诚无私,00:26:32.592,00:26:34.380,Not all of them are truthful and impartial.
00:26:33.670,00:26:36.960,你百般求见也不问朕好不好,00:26:34.380,00:26:36.072,You requested to see me.
00:26:37.340,00:26:38.920,就是为了跟朕谈这个吗,00:26:36.606,00:26:39.823,"Instead of asking about me,
do you just to talk about this?"
00:26:41.180,00:26:45.220,当日对纯元皇后的大不敬之罪,00:26:42.113,00:26:43.780,Have you repented for
00:26:46.520,00:26:47.430,你可知道了吗,00:26:44.000,00:26:48.220,your major disrespect to Empress Première?
00:26:49.600,00:26:54.100,臣妾若说是无心皇上信吗,00:26:50.222,00:26:52.206,Would Your Majesty believe me
,,,00:26:53.760,00:26:55.320,if I say it was unintentional?
00:26:54.530,00:26:58.360,无心也罢有意也罢错便是错,00:26:55.320,00:26:59.376,"Whether it was intentional or not,
you made a grave mistake."
00:27:03.700,00:27:06.990,臣妾冒犯纯元皇后罪孽深重,00:27:04.455,00:27:08.043,"For my grave offence to Empress Première,"
00:27:08.540,00:27:11.830,宁愿一生禁足羞见天颜,00:27:09.422,00:27:12.960,"I'm willing to be confined for life,
forbidden to see Your Majesty."
00:27:13.790,00:27:17.250,但请皇上能再审一审,00:27:14.634,00:27:16.733,But I beg of Your Majesty...
00:27:17.590,00:27:18.540,臣妾父亲一案,00:27:17.443,00:27:19.422,Please further investigate my father's case.
00:27:19.130,00:27:20.340,不要使一人含冤,00:27:20.000,00:27:21.902,Don't let anyone be falsely accused.
00:27:21.300,00:27:22.420,你方才也说了,00:27:22.168,00:27:23.626,"As you said earlier,"
00:27:23.220,00:27:25.590,不可尽信一面之词,00:27:24.058,00:27:26.711,I shouldn't solely rely on one-sided arguments.
00:27:26.890,00:27:29.550,鄂敏的话朕也不会全信,00:27:27.867,00:27:30.525,I won't trust everything that Emin has to say.
00:27:30.730,00:27:32.390,但是钱名世一事,,,
00:27:32.860,00:27:34.310,你父亲的一言一行,00:27:31.618,00:27:33.748,"However, regarding Qian Mingshi,"
00:27:34.820,00:27:36.020,朕都瞧在眼里,00:27:33.748,00:27:37.039,"I've witnessed your father's words
and actions with my own eyes."
00:27:36.440,00:27:40.980,种种事端实不算是冤了你母家,00:27:37.305,00:27:39.094,"Based on all the facts,"
,,,00:27:39.798,00:27:42.574,this decision is not unfair to your family.
00:27:42.910,00:27:44.400,外间之事诡橘莫辨,00:27:43.709,00:27:45.951,The circumstances can be changeful and deceptive.
00:27:45.160,00:27:46.490,臣妾也不十分清楚,00:27:45.951,00:27:48.051,I don't know what really happened.
00:27:48.120,00:27:49.990,但臣妾父亲对皇上的忠心,00:27:48.859,00:27:51.597,"Nevertheless, will Your Majesty not consider"
00:27:51.790,00:27:53.700,皇上也无半分顾念了吗,00:27:52.760,00:27:55.299,my father's steadfast loyalty to Your Majesty?
00:27:54.750,00:27:56.740,甄远道夫妻年事已高,00:27:55.565,00:27:58.010,"Zhen Yuandao and his wife are advanced in age,"
00:27:58.010,00:27:59.290,朕会从轻发落,00:27:58.676,00:28:00.755,so I will grant them clemency.
00:28:01.010,00:28:02.170,朕已经下旨,00:28:01.895,00:28:03.840,I have given the order
00:28:03.090,00:28:06.840,甄远道及其家眷流放育古塔,00:28:04.074,00:28:07.680,"to banish Zhen Yuandao and
his dependents to Ningguta."
00:28:07.470,00:28:08.930,不必给披甲人为奴,00:28:08.434,00:28:10.694,"They won't become the slaves
of the frontiersmen who surrendered."
00:28:09.850,00:28:11.140,只住在那里就行了,00:28:10.694,00:28:12.782,They will just be living there.
00:28:12.690,00:28:15.270,也算是朕姑念他的辛苦吧,00:28:13.483,00:28:16.326,With respect to his hard work.
00:28:15.900,00:28:17.760,育古塔苦寒无比,00:28:16.540,00:28:18.702,Ningguta is bitterly cold.
00:28:19.650,00:28:21.360,臣妾父母一把年纪,00:28:20.533,00:28:22.781,"My parents, at their age..."
00:28:22.570,00:28:24.280,怎能受得了这样的苦楚,00:28:23.269,00:28:25.833,How can they survive such hardship!
00:28:26.200,00:28:27.160,皇上,00:28:26.812,00:28:28.012,Your Majesty...
00:28:28.580,00:28:30.320,到底真的是铁证如山,00:28:29.494,00:28:32.066,Is there really ironclad evidence against my father?
00:28:31.660,00:28:33.750,还是皇上对敦亲王与年羹尧一事,00:28:32.466,00:28:34.451,Or is Your Majesty casting doubt on him
00:28:34.080,00:28:35.740,耿耿于怀而要疑心他人,00:28:34.451,00:28:37.212,"because you are possessed by the treachery
of State Prince Dun and Nian Gengyao?"
00:28:37.920,00:28:39.250,你知道你在说什么吗,00:28:38.600,00:28:40.627,Do you know what you are talking about?!
00:28:51.730,00:28:53.430,寄予宛宛爱妻,00:28:52.529,00:28:54.869,To my beloved wife Surissé:
00:28:55.060,00:28:56.140,念悲去,00:28:55.903,00:28:58.113,My heart aches when I think of your tragic passing.
00:28:57.310,00:28:59.050,独余斯良苦此身,00:28:58.113,00:29:00.373,Leaving me behind in this sorrowful shell.
00:29:01.440,00:29:06.360,常自魂牵梦萦忧思难忘,00:29:02.372,00:29:08.120,"You lift my soul to see you in my dreams -
A yearning I can never forget."
00:29:09.450,00:29:15.950,纵得莞莞莞莞类卿暂排苦思,00:29:10.000,00:29:14.147,"Even though I have encountered
Sourire to your resemblance,"
00:29:18.040,00:29:20.330,亦除却巫山非云也,00:29:15.452,00:29:18.218,who temporarily eased my suffering.
,,,00:29:18.706,00:29:22.995,"After all, “The clouds are not the same
once you’ve passed Mountain Wushan.”"
00:29:25.510,00:29:27.500,除却巫山非云也,00:29:26.265,00:29:29.440,"“The clouds are not the same
once you’ve passed Mountain Wushan.”"
00:29:29.220,00:29:31.380,好一个除却巫山非云也,00:29:30.000,00:29:32.875,How nice of a comparison it is!
00:29:35.140,00:29:36.720,难道我得到的一切,00:29:35.850,00:29:38.475,Did I gain all the favor...
00:29:41.440,00:29:43.310,全是因为纯元皇后,00:29:42.224,00:29:45.040,solely because of Empress Première?
00:29:45.860,00:29:47.690,为了一个莞莞类卿,00:29:46.792,00:29:48.960,Because I resemble her?
00:29:52.950,00:29:53.990,那我算什么,00:29:53.572,00:29:55.214,So what am I?

00:30:03.260,00:30:06.170,其实能有几分像宛宛,00:30:04.073,00:30:05.044,"In fact,"
,,,00:30:05.444,00:30:07.136,it's your blessing

00:30:08.590,00:30:09.380,是吗,00:30:09.267,00:30:10.396,Is that so?
00:30:11.640,00:30:15.760,究竟是我的福还是我的孽,00:30:12.573,00:30:14.414,Is it really a blessing
,,,00:30:15.258,00:30:16.964,"or rather, a sin?"
00:30:18.060,00:30:22.810,何止是皇上错了我更是错了,00:30:19.037,00:30:21.028,"Not only is Your Majesty mistaken,"
,,,00:30:22.367,00:30:23.976,I'm also at fault!
00:30:24.740,00:30:28.480,这几年的情爱与时光,00:30:25.628,00:30:26.925,"All these years,"
,,,00:30:27.857,00:30:29.752,"the affection, and the time..."
00:30:29.530,00:30:31.440,究竟是错付了,00:30:30.462,00:30:32.640,All spent on the wrong person!

00:33:06.310,00:33:08.050,娘娘莞嫔出了好多血,00:33:07.204,00:33:09.051,"Your Majesty, Concubine Sourire had serious bleeding."
00:33:08.360,00:33:09.020,怕是要生了,,,
00:33:09.820,00:33:11.520,从养心殿出来就动了胎气,00:33:09.076,00:33:10.368,Could be giving birth soon.
00:33:11.860,00:33:12.770,大概是要早产了,00:33:10.903,00:33:13.026,"Her prenatal qi was damaged after
visiting the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
,,,00:33:13.026,00:33:14.136,Looks like a premature birth.
00:33:16.360,00:33:18.100,采月 采月 快快快,00:33:17.265,00:33:19.005,"Lunar, Lunar, hurry up."
00:33:18.450,00:33:19.780,快传轿 我要去碎玉轩,00:33:19.005,00:33:20.815,"Get the sedan ready.
I'm going to the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:33:19.990,00:33:20.480,是,,,
00:33:20.620,00:33:21.030,快,,,
00:33:21.240,00:33:21.900,现在别去,00:33:20.840,00:33:21.794,"- Yes.
- Hurry."
,,,00:33:21.819,00:33:22.981,Don't go right now.
00:33:22.750,00:33:23.360,不成啊,00:33:23.615,00:33:24.403,I have to!
00:33:23.710,00:33:25.620,生孩子是大事 我得陪着嬛儿,00:33:24.428,00:33:26.695,"I must be there.
Giving birth is crucial to Huan'er."
00:33:25.870,00:33:26.450,不能去,00:33:26.720,00:33:27.759,Stop.
00:33:27.210,00:33:29.120,你应该让皇上自个儿去听听,00:33:28.115,00:33:30.025,His Majesty needs to see for himself
00:33:29.340,00:33:31.290,莞嫔是怎么给他拼了命生孩子的,00:33:30.126,00:33:32.285,"how hard Sourire is protecting
this heir with her life."
00:33:31.670,00:33:33.790,这样皇上心里才放不下莞嫔,00:33:32.575,00:33:34.828,"This way, His Majesty will always
have Sourire on his mind."
00:33:34.550,00:33:36.840,莞嫔才能有重新被恩宠的机会,00:33:35.395,00:33:37.789,It's her only chance to regain favor.
00:33:37.140,00:33:39.000,这样的恩宠要它来做什么,00:33:38.036,00:33:39.965,Why does she need this kind of favor?
00:33:39.300,00:33:40.010,你可以不要,00:33:39.989,00:33:41.145,"Perhaps you don't need it,"
00:33:40.470,00:33:41.880,但是莞嫔不能不要,00:33:41.375,00:33:42.936,but Sourire has no other choice.
00:33:42.600,00:33:44.010,莞嫔要是保不住命,00:33:43.475,00:33:45.034,"If Sourire weren't able to save herself,"
00:33:44.520,00:33:46.260,那孩子也就活不成了,00:33:45.425,00:33:47.564,then the child also wouldn't be able to survive.
00:33:47.770,00:33:49.480,那那我去请皇上,00:33:48.596,00:33:50.689,"Then, I will bring His Majesty over."
00:33:50.570,00:33:51.220,好妹妹,00:33:51.415,00:33:52.345,"My sister,"
00:33:51.530,00:33:53.310,皇上最好自个儿愿意去,00:33:52.345,00:33:54.409,His Majesty has to bring himself over.
00:33:53.740,00:33:54.690,否则你就要去请,00:33:54.409,00:33:56.032,"Otherwise, you will be pleading with him."
00:33:55.700,00:33:58.560,可是现在还有一件事比这更重要,00:33:56.535,00:33:59.509,"However, there's one thing that's more important."
00:33:58.950,00:34:01.530,如果莞嫔父亲命都保不住的话,00:33:59.775,00:34:02.505,"If Sourire's father lost his life,"
00:34:01.870,00:34:03.200,那么莞嫔就是生了孩子,,,
00:34:03.700,00:34:04.860,也是罪臣之女,00:34:02.566,00:34:06.030,"Sourire would still be the daughter of a
disgraced official even if she gives birth to a child."
00:34:05.460,00:34:07.740,她以后如何抬得起头来呢,00:34:06.365,00:34:08.645,How will she be able to lift her head in the palace?
00:34:10.460,00:34:11.200,好,,,
00:34:11.750,00:34:12.870,那我这就去安排,00:34:11.365,00:34:12.417,All right.
,,,00:34:12.595,00:34:13.814,I will go arrange
00:34:13.260,00:34:14.960,让温太医先去救治甄大人,00:34:14.065,00:34:16.038,Dr. Wen to treat Sourire's father.

,,,00:34:46.192,00:34:47.123,Don't worry.
00:34:46.120,00:34:48.530,有人去大牢里照顾甄远道了吗,00:34:47.123,00:34:49.435,"Is somebody looking after
Zhen Yuandao in the jail?"
00:34:49.000,00:34:51.290,惠贵人不是举荐了温太医吗,00:34:49.875,00:34:52.198,Noble Lady has recommended Dr. Wen.

00:36:29.020,00:36:30.050,公主是早崖,00:36:29.835,00:36:31.203,The princess was born prematurely.

,,,00:37:08.508,00:37:10.400,have you not thought it through?
00:37:11.020,00:37:12.880,皇上让臣妾想明白什么,00:37:12.260,00:37:14.164,What does Your Majesty want me to think through?
00:37:15.560,00:37:17.970,你已经为朕生下了一位公主,00:37:16.540,00:37:18.960,You have given birth to a princess for me.
00:37:19.070,00:37:20.270,还要意气用事吗,00:37:20.040,00:37:21.418,Are you still going to act with emotions?
00:37:23.030,00:37:26.320,朕已经决定无论甄家如何,00:37:24.080,00:37:25.376,I have decided
00:37:26.820,00:37:28.110,都不会迁怒于你,00:37:26.042,00:37:27.558,"not to vent anger on you,"
,,,00:37:27.558,00:37:29.809,regardless of the decision on your family.
00:37:30.080,00:37:31.190,只要你愿意,00:37:30.940,00:37:32.149,"If you wish,"
00:37:31.950,00:37:34.990,朕明日就可以下旨封你为妃,00:37:32.980,00:37:36.020,"I can issue a decree tomorrow
to grant you the rank of Consort."
00:37:35.960,00:37:39.320,臣妾失德 不敢忝居妃位,00:37:36.580,00:37:38.204,I am a virtue less concubine.
,,,00:37:38.920,00:37:40.549,I dare not shamefully hold the title of Consort.
,,,00:37:43.380,00:37:44.490,Huan Huan ...
00:37:42.380,00:37:48.750,嬛嬛 若你肯 你还是朕的宠妃,00:37:46.580,00:37:47.879,"If you wish,"
,,,00:37:48.101,00:37:50.000,you’re still my beloved consort.
00:37:49.390,00:37:52.000,朕待你还和从前一样,00:37:50.320,00:37:52.940,I’ll treat you just like before.
00:37:53.390,00:37:54.300,从前,00:37:54.300,00:37:55.442,Just like before?
00:37:58.190,00:37:59.350,皇上以为,00:37:59.220,00:38:00.380,Your Majesty believes
00:38:00.690,00:38:01.980,还能回到从前吗,00:38:01.640,00:38:03.480,we still can return to the former days?
00:38:20.960,00:38:24.500,的确是朕太过垂怜你了,00:38:21.900,00:38:23.306,I have indeed
,,,00:38:24.061,00:38:25.751,pampered you excessively.
00:38:27.090,00:38:28.330,你这样的心性,00:38:28.160,00:38:30.000,"With a disposition like yours,"
00:38:29.890,00:38:31.720,实在是不适合留在宫中,00:38:30.940,00:38:33.002,you're not suited to staying in the palace.
00:38:34.180,00:38:35.140,多谢皇上,,,
00:38:36.310,00:38:37.800,去佛堂静静心吧,00:38:35.340,00:38:36.655,I thank Your Majesty.
00:38:38.270,00:38:39.220,不用住在这儿了,00:38:37.360,00:38:39.171,Living in the temple will calm your heart.
,,,00:38:39.380,00:38:40.740,You don’t need to live here now.
00:38:40.860,00:38:45.020,不错 臣妾是不用住在这里了,00:38:41.840,00:38:42.853,Right.
,,,00:38:44.407,00:38:46.977,I have no more reasons to live here.
00:38:47.570,00:38:49.440,公主若有臣妾这样的母亲,00:38:48.540,00:38:50.766,With a mother like me
00:38:50.240,00:38:51.860,有这样落魄的家族,00:38:51.254,00:38:52.840,"who has such a woeful family,"
00:38:53.240,00:38:55.580,公主只会因为臣妾而备受苦楚,00:38:54.180,00:38:56.653,the princess only has more to suffer.
00:39:00.420,00:39:01.780,臣妾既想离开,00:39:01.420,00:39:03.135,"Since I have decided to leave,"
00:39:04.420,00:39:08.580,孩儿的姓名就允许臣妾来取吧,00:39:05.400,00:39:09.560,please allow me to give her a name.
00:39:10.220,00:39:11.460,请皇上成全,00:39:11.180,00:39:12.660,I seek Your Majesty’s permission.

00:39:15.680,00:39:19.850,就叫绾绾,00:39:16.640,00:39:18.150,I’ll name her ...
00:39:20.230,00:39:20.970,宛宛,00:39:19.349,00:39:20.820,Rissé.
00:39:22.190,00:39:23.270,臣妾怎敢让公主,00:39:21.080,00:39:22.264,Rissé?
00:39:23.610,00:39:25.770,沿用先皇后的小字这样大不敬,00:39:23.420,00:39:26.927,"How dare I give her a reminiscent
name of the late Empress's?"
00:39:27.650,00:39:29.270,长发绾君心,00:39:28.314,00:39:31.640,"It’s the character from “A strand of hair
tied to my husband's, binding my heart to his.”"
00:39:30.660,00:39:34.320,臣妾做不到的就让公主来做吧,00:39:31.640,00:39:33.347,What I failed to accomplish -
00:39:36.450,00:39:37.490,臣妾残生,00:39:33.658,00:39:35.924,I hope the princess will be able to.
00:39:38.370,00:39:40.080,也会于青灯古佛之畔,00:39:37.460,00:39:41.100,I will pray for her with an oil lamp by the Buddha
00:39:41.330,00:39:42.490,为她日夜祈祷,00:39:42.160,00:39:43.894,in the remnant of my life.
00:39:45.880,00:39:48.500,其实你不想出宫修行也可,00:39:46.880,00:39:49.500,"You don’t have to live in a
nunnery outside the palace."
00:39:49.760,00:39:51.290,可在宫中的宝华殿,00:39:50.740,00:39:52.800,You can stay at the Baohua Hall here.
00:39:51.800,00:39:55.390,不 臣妾不祥之身,00:39:52.800,00:39:54.212,No.
,,,00:39:55.056,00:39:56.844,I'm a person of ill omen.
00:39:56.970,00:39:58.510,不敢扰了宫中平安,00:39:57.980,00:40:00.040,I dare not disturb the peace in the palace.
00:40:01.640,00:40:02.760,你早去也好,00:40:02.400,00:40:04.340,"If so, leaving sooner will benefit you."
00:40:03.480,00:40:04.640,宫中也留不得了,00:40:04.340,00:40:06.033,Don't stay any longer in the palace.
00:40:11.740,00:40:14.480,娘娘小主,00:40:12.766,00:40:14.216,Your Highness.
,,,00:40:14.749,00:40:16.039,My Lady.

,,,00:40:25.700,00:40:26.873,"After my departure,"
00:40:27.050,00:40:29.330,希望能由敬妃娘娘来抚育公主,00:40:28.020,00:40:30.655,"I hope the princess will be raised by
Her Highness Consort Estime."
00:40:31.760,00:40:35.170,若能如此臣妾再无遗憾,00:40:32.820,00:40:34.420,"If this is permitted,"
,,,00:40:34.642,00:40:36.842,I would have no more regret.
00:40:37.430,00:40:39.470,端妃已经收养了温宜,00:40:38.380,00:40:40.598,Consort Honnête has adopted Wenyi.
00:40:40.220,00:40:42.220,敬妃还可托付,00:40:41.100,00:40:43.100,Consort Estime is able to commit.

honorary name Longyue [misty moon]."
00:40:51.610,00:40:55.150,公主都是满月那日才能赐予封号,00:40:52.460,00:40:56.060,"Princesses are granted their honorary
names when they turn one month old."
00:40:56.620,00:40:59.360,胧月一出生就能得此殊荣,00:40:57.580,00:41:00.764,Longyue is honored to be granted one shortly after birth.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
