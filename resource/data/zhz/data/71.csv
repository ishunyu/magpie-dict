00:02:21.800,00:02:22.420,去吧,00:02:22.900,00:02:23.600,Go on.
00:02:26.180,00:02:27.670,这奴才们身份卑微,,,
00:02:28.060,00:02:29.300,怕是碰不得这些吉物,00:02:27.280,00:02:29.160,We servants have a lowly status
00:02:30.020,00:02:32.510,那奴才们也就不送各位娘娘,00:02:29.160,00:02:30.702,and shouldn't touch such auspicious items.
00:02:32.810,00:02:34.150,进我们娘娘的寝殿了,00:02:31.120,00:02:35.240,We won't accompany Their Highnesses inside.
00:02:34.860,00:02:36.310,万一真是冲撞了神灵,,,
00:02:36.650,00:02:37.560,怕是不好呢,00:02:35.960,00:02:38.640,We wouldn't want to offend the gods.
00:02:38.320,00:02:38.980,也是啊,,,
00:02:39.490,00:02:40.320,这样的事情,00:02:39.420,00:02:40.306,That's true.
00:02:40.660,00:02:43.240,还是谨慎些比较好 给本宫吧,00:02:40.590,00:02:43.000,"In such situations, it's better to be cautious."
,,,00:02:43.000,00:02:44.340,Allow me.
00:02:50.080,00:02:50.700,娘娘,,,
00:02:52.330,00:02:53.320,娘娘今日的安胎药,00:02:51.180,00:02:51.989,Your Highness.
00:02:53.590,00:02:54.320,还没有喝呢,00:02:53.430,00:02:55.400,You haven't yet taken your prenatal tonic today.
00:02:54.710,00:02:55.870,方才给您送过来的时候,,,
00:02:56.170,00:02:56.910,您说太烫了,00:02:55.810,00:02:58.000,Earlier you said it was too hot.
00:02:57.260,00:02:58.120,这会子刚刚温,00:02:58.360,00:02:59.360,It's cooled down now.
00:02:58.590,00:03:00.130,再放怕就凉了,00:02:59.690,00:03:01.532,It' will get cold if we wait longer.
00:03:36.250,00:03:36.870,皇上,,,
00:03:37.710,00:03:39.330,臣妾和皇后 两位姐姐,00:03:37.350,00:03:38.234,Your Majesty.
00:03:39.630,00:03:40.370,很快就出来,00:03:38.758,00:03:41.395,We will all return momentarily.
00:03:40.880,00:03:41.710,去吧,00:03:41.980,00:03:42.810,Go on.
00:03:46.470,00:03:49.630,皇后娘娘贤惠起来还真贤惠呢,00:03:47.570,00:03:50.730,"Her Majesty can indeed be virtuous
 when she wants to be."
00:03:50.640,00:03:52.470,从前不喜欢熹贵妃,00:03:51.740,00:03:53.834,Before she didn't like Noble Consort Lumière.
00:03:53.100,00:03:55.590,现在却能委曲求全,00:03:54.200,00:03:56.690,Now she is willing to preserve the peace.
00:03:56.570,00:03:57.810,不许议论皇后,00:03:57.670,00:03:59.506,Don't talk disrespectfully about the Empress.
00:04:11.710,00:04:13.410,臣妾多谢皇后成全,,,
00:04:14.210,00:04:16.820,肯为臣妾亲手系上福袋,00:04:12.810,00:04:17.920,"I thank Your Majesty for granting my wish,
personally tying a talisman pouch for me."
00:04:17.840,00:04:20.120,本宫是皇后 理应如此,00:04:18.940,00:04:21.220,I am the Empress. It is my duty.
00:04:21.510,00:04:22.920,论理应当如此,00:04:22.610,00:04:24.171,"As a rule, it is your duty."
00:04:23.430,00:04:27.760,可是论情 皇后应该很恨臣妾吧,00:04:24.530,00:04:28.860,"But in terms of feelings, Your Majesty most likely resents me."
00:04:32.810,00:04:34.270,本宫送你送子观音,00:04:33.910,00:04:35.580,I gifted you the Guanyin statue
00:04:34.480,00:04:36.640,就是希望你能够平心静气,00:04:35.580,00:04:37.745,hoping to bring peace to your heart.
00:04:37.110,00:04:38.220,不要乱了心神,,,
00:04:38.650,00:04:39.760,现在最重要的,,,
00:04:40.030,00:04:41.690,就是为皇上生下龙胎,00:04:38.014,00:04:42.760,"The most important thing now is to
 give birth to this heir for His Majesty."
00:04:45.070,00:04:47.940,龙胎是否能保 全在皇后,00:04:46.170,00:04:50.440,"Whether my child can survive is
entirely up to Your Majesty, not I."
00:04:48.580,00:04:49.360,不在臣妾,,,
00:04:51.120,00:04:52.110,此话怎么说,,,
00:04:52.830,00:04:53.820,难道不是吗,00:04:52.220,00:04:53.474,Why is that?
,,,00:04:53.930,00:04:55.222,Is that not true?
00:04:56.080,00:04:58.450,顺娘娘心意龙胎可保,00:04:57.180,00:04:59.550,"If Your Majesty so wishes, an heir can live."
00:04:58.790,00:05:00.410,逆娘娘心意母子俱损,00:04:59.890,00:05:02.227,"But both mother and child can be ruined if their lives
run counter to Your Majesty's wishes."
00:05:01.420,00:05:02.250,多年来,00:05:02.520,00:05:03.600,"For so many years,"
00:05:02.550,00:05:04.540,皇后娘娘一直如此统一六宫,00:05:03.650,00:05:05.640,Your Majesty has ruled the harem in this way.
00:05:05.880,00:05:07.340,臣妾实在害怕,00:05:06.980,00:05:08.440,I'm truly frightened
00:05:07.760,00:05:09.470,若哪天得罪了皇后娘娘,00:05:08.860,00:05:10.796,"that if, one day, I offend Your Majesty,"
00:05:10.220,00:05:13.210,臣妾肚子里的孩子就保不住了,00:05:11.320,00:05:14.200,I won't be able to save the baby in my belly.
00:05:13.480,00:05:15.470,放肆 你敢污蔑本宫,00:05:14.310,00:05:16.570,Nonsense! You dare slander me?
00:05:15.770,00:05:16.510,污蔑,00:05:16.870,00:05:17.761,Slander?
00:05:18.520,00:05:18.890,放手,,,
00:05:19.150,00:05:20.480,你敢不敢对着神明发誓,00:05:19.520,00:05:20.234,Let go!
00:05:22.190,00:05:23.930,发誓你从未害过皇嗣,00:05:20.234,00:05:21.957,Do you dare swear to the divine beings
00:05:24.570,00:05:25.520,从未害过嫔妃,00:05:23.290,00:05:25.181,that you've never harmed any imperial heirs?
00:05:25.820,00:05:26.690,从未害过臣妾,00:05:25.492,00:05:26.742,Any concubines?
00:05:27.910,00:05:29.190,本宫是六宫之主,00:05:26.920,00:05:28.660,And that you've never harmed me?
00:05:29.490,00:05:30.780,怎么可能和你发誓,00:05:29.010,00:05:32.168,"I am the head of the harem.
Why should I swear at your command?"
00:05:31.790,00:05:32.440,你放手,,,
00:05:32.790,00:05:33.700,你不敢了吧,00:05:32.890,00:05:33.720,Let go!
,,,00:05:33.890,00:05:34.800,"You're scared, aren't you?"
00:05:35.460,00:05:36.870,齐妃为何而死,00:05:36.560,00:05:38.080,Why did Consort Austuce commit suicide?
00:05:38.040,00:05:39.580,案嫔为何生不出孩子,00:05:39.140,00:05:40.831,Why did Concubine Paix lose her fertility?
00:05:40.460,00:05:41.670,富察贵人小产,00:05:41.560,00:05:42.959,Noble Lady Fuca's miscarriage.
00:05:42.840,00:05:44.700,还有臣妾当年的孩子,00:05:43.940,00:05:45.800,And the loss of my first child.
00:05:46.050,00:05:47.790,你做了那么多亏心事,00:05:47.150,00:05:49.268,You've done so many wicked things.
00:05:48.390,00:05:50.090,你自己心里最清楚,00:05:49.490,00:05:51.190,"In your heart, you know full well!"
00:06:00.810,00:06:01.640,怎么会这样,,,
00:06:01.820,00:06:02.470,娘娘怎么了,00:06:01.910,00:06:02.920,How did this happen?

00:06:07.150,00:06:07.890,娘娘,00:06:06.460,00:06:07.680,What's happened to Her Highness?
00:06:09.110,00:06:09.940,娘娘怎么了,00:06:08.250,00:06:09.141,Your Highness!
00:06:12.950,00:06:14.030,娘娘这是怎么了,00:06:10.210,00:06:11.040,What's wrong?

00:06:15.700,00:06:17.440,娘娘 娘娘 娘娘,00:06:15.720,00:06:16.630,We need help!

00:06:31.140,00:06:31.880,娘娘,00:06:32.040,00:06:33.080,Her Highness...
00:06:40.690,00:06:41.970,娘娘,00:06:41.720,00:06:43.221,Your Highness!
00:06:42.860,00:06:44.440,回皇上 娘娘醒了,00:06:43.689,00:06:45.660,"Your Majesty, Her Highness is awake."
00:06:54.830,00:06:56.860,熹贵妃 你醒了,00:06:55.930,00:06:58.264,"Noble Consort Lumière, you're awake."
00:06:58.330,00:07:00.160,熹贵妃 你节哀吧,00:06:59.430,00:07:01.420,"Noble Consort Lumière, you should refrain from grief."
00:07:00.830,00:07:01.870,孩子总会有的,00:07:01.840,00:07:03.360,You will have another child someday.
00:07:04.090,00:07:06.120,孩子总会有的,00:07:05.040,00:07:07.333,I will have another child someday...
00:07:07.010,00:07:09.290,皇后娘娘轻描淡写一句话,00:07:08.000,00:07:10.951,"How can Your Majesty treat my child
as if he were a withered weed,"
00:07:10.760,00:07:13.050,就当臣妾的孩子命如草芥吗,00:07:11.700,00:07:14.150,offering words of such faint comfort?
00:07:15.180,00:07:16.040,皇后,00:07:16.240,00:07:17.353,"Your Majesty,"
00:07:17.640,00:07:19.220,你再厌恶臣妾,00:07:18.640,00:07:20.593,"no matter how much you resent me,"
00:07:20.770,00:07:22.890,为什么要害臣妾的孩子,00:07:21.800,00:07:24.150,why did you have to harm my child?
00:07:25.440,00:07:27.850,荒谬 本宫哪有害你的孩子,00:07:26.480,00:07:29.270,Ridiculous! When have I ever harmed your child?
00:07:29.690,00:07:32.440,皇上 皇上,00:07:30.790,00:07:33.620,Your Majesty... Your Majesty...
00:07:33.910,00:07:36.240,臣妾的孩子没了,00:07:35.010,00:07:37.336,"My child is gone,"
00:07:37.540,00:07:39.530,并非是臣妾自己不小心,00:07:38.600,00:07:40.991,not because I was careless.
00:07:41.460,00:07:42.870,是皇后娘娘,00:07:42.560,00:07:44.000,It was Her Majesty...
00:07:44.380,00:07:46.160,她与臣妾发生争执,00:07:45.400,00:07:47.460,She had a quarrel with me ...
00:07:47.630,00:07:49.090,她推了臣妾,00:07:48.640,00:07:50.430,and she pushed me.
00:07:55.300,00:07:57.540,皇上 娘娘的腹部,,,
00:07:57.760,00:07:59.300,的确有遭受过重击的述象,00:07:56.400,00:08:00.533,"Your Majesty, there are signs of Her Highness
being struck heavily on the stomach."
00:07:59.980,00:08:01.180,太医们皆可验证,00:08:00.920,00:08:02.480,The imperial doctors can testify to that.
00:08:01.940,00:08:03.720,肯定是有人大力地推了娘娘,00:08:03.000,00:08:05.020,Someone must have pushed Her Highness forcefully.
00:08:04.690,00:08:06.800,而且娘娘腹中的胎儿一向健康,00:08:05.640,00:08:08.020,"Besides, the fetus in her belly has always been healthy."
00:08:07.320,00:08:09.310,想必皇上也经常能够听到,,,
00:08:09.610,00:08:10.390,胎儿的胎动,00:08:08.320,00:08:11.515,Your Majesty must have felt the fetal movement often.
00:08:10.940,00:08:11.900,若非遭受意外,,,
00:08:12.360,00:08:14.150,是绝对不会导致小产的,00:08:12.000,00:08:15.440,"Were it not for the accident, a miscarriage would never have happened."
00:08:17.490,00:08:20.480,皇后 当时寝殿里,00:08:18.400,00:08:19.360,"Empress,"
00:08:21.160,00:08:23.280,只有你和熹贵妃两个人,00:08:20.260,00:08:24.238,only you and Noble Consort Lumière were inside the chamber!
00:08:24.370,00:08:25.110,皇上,00:08:25.400,00:08:26.410,Your Majesty...
00:08:33.170,00:08:33.830,你,00:08:34.200,00:08:35.151,"You,"
00:08:36.140,00:08:36.800,还有你,,,
00:08:37.890,00:08:39.500,当时你们在寝殿门口,00:08:37.000,00:08:38.202,and you.
00:08:40.140,00:08:41.260,可有看到了什么,00:08:38.750,00:08:40.753,You two were right outside by the door.
00:08:41.890,00:08:43.130,臣妾当时和皇贵妃,00:08:41.120,00:08:42.520,Did you see anything?
00:08:43.480,00:08:44.930,在寝殿外在聊天,00:08:42.920,00:08:46.039,The Imperial Consort and I were conversing outside the chamber.
00:08:45.230,00:08:46.010,未曾看到什么,,,
00:08:46.520,00:08:47.230,只是,00:08:46.039,00:08:48.052,"We did not see anything, however..."
00:08:48.820,00:08:51.650,这 只是臣妾和皇贵妃,,,
00:08:52.400,00:08:53.860,确实有听到寝殿内,00:08:49.920,00:08:55.441,"However, the Imperial Consort and I did hear from inside the chamber"
00:08:54.950,00:08:56.360,皇后娘娘和熹贵妃,,,
00:08:56.660,00:08:57.650,好像发生了争执,00:08:55.802,00:08:58.880,that Her Majesty and Noble Consort Lumière seemed to be having a dispute.
00:08:58.700,00:08:59.690,是啊 皇上,00:08:59.800,00:09:01.064,"It's true, Your Majesty."
00:09:00.490,00:09:02.450,皇后与熹贵妃发生争执,00:09:01.590,00:09:03.550,Her Majesty and Noble Consort Lumière were arguing.
00:09:02.700,00:09:04.040,臣妾们不敢闯进来,,,
00:09:04.370,00:09:05.740,臣妾听见熹贵妃说,00:09:03.550,00:09:05.120,We didn't dare to barge in.
00:09:06.040,00:09:07.870,害怕呀 恐惧什么的,00:09:05.360,00:09:09.043,"I heard Noble Consort Lumière utter words like ""afraid"" and ""terrified""."
00:09:08.710,00:09:12.080,皇后还让熹贵妃安分守己,00:09:09.810,00:09:13.500,"And Her Majesty told Noble Consort Lumière
to know her place and behave properly."
00:09:12.590,00:09:15.380,其余的臣妾就没有看见了,00:09:13.690,00:09:16.440,I did not make out anything else.
00:09:17.470,00:09:20.930,朕和这许多的眼睛倒是看到了,00:09:18.520,00:09:22.320,"I saw with my own eyes, along with many pairs of eyes here,"
00:09:22.310,00:09:26.020,熹贵妃受伤晕倒只有皇后在侧,00:09:23.410,00:09:27.360,"When Noble Consort Lumière was injured and fainted,
only the Empress was at her side."
00:09:26.940,00:09:27.640,皇上,00:09:28.000,00:09:29.040,Your Majesty...
00:09:29.110,00:09:31.390,皇后怨恨臣妾得您宠爱,00:09:30.000,00:09:32.640,Her Majesty resents me for being favored by Your Majesty.
00:09:32.400,00:09:34.310,总以为臣妾有不敬之心,00:09:33.080,00:09:35.560,She believes that I harbor disrespect in my heart.
00:09:34.570,00:09:35.480,出言责怪,00:09:35.600,00:09:37.040,She rebuked me for it...
00:09:36.860,00:09:41.150,盛怒之下 她就推了臣妾,00:09:37.946,00:09:42.200,and pushed me in fierce anger.
00:09:42.330,00:09:43.990,当时熹贵妃胡搅蛮缠,00:09:43.280,00:09:45.200,Noble Consort Lumière was pestering and harassing me.
00:09:44.330,00:09:45.240,拉住臣妾的手,00:09:45.200,00:09:46.632,"She grabbed my hand,"
00:09:45.870,00:09:47.990,臣妾用力挣脱 才甩开她的手,00:09:46.960,00:09:49.054,and I had to use strength to get myself away.
00:09:48.330,00:09:49.490,并未推过熹贵妃,00:09:49.280,00:09:51.168,I did not push Noble Consort Lumière!
00:09:53.300,00:09:54.630,如皇后所言,00:09:54.360,00:09:55.890,"According to what you said,"
00:09:55.130,00:09:57.670,那么熹贵妃是自己推倒了自己,00:09:56.080,00:09:58.800,it was Noble Consort Lumière who pushed herself over.
00:09:58.550,00:09:59.710,臣妾也不明白,00:09:59.600,00:10:00.930,"Your Majesty, I don't understand"
00:10:00.010,00:10:02.000,熹贵妃她为何胡搅蛮缠,00:10:01.000,00:10:03.240,why Noble Consort Lumière would pester Your Majesty.
00:10:02.890,00:10:04.220,熹贵妃她为人谨慎,,,
00:10:04.640,00:10:06.600,连喝安胎药都遵照太医的嘱咐,00:10:03.990,00:10:05.640,Noble Consort Lumière is modest and prudent.
00:10:06.890,00:10:07.880,一碗不落地喝,00:10:05.680,00:10:09.062,"She follows the doctor's advice
and takes every bowl of the prenatal tonics on time."
00:10:08.230,00:10:10.340,这么多年 熹贵妃对皇后娘娘,,,
00:10:10.690,00:10:11.970,可以说是勤谨恭敬,00:10:09.280,00:10:13.280,"For all these years, Noble Consort Lumière
has treated Your Majesty with diligence and deference."
00:10:13.400,00:10:14.140,就算熹贵妃,,,
00:10:14.480,00:10:15.940,有言语冲撞了皇后娘娘,00:10:14.440,00:10:17.083,"Even if she displeased Your Majesty with certain words,"
00:10:16.240,00:10:17.480,娘娘也要宽恕她呀,,,
00:10:18.450,00:10:20.310,好歹也要顾念着,00:10:17.083,00:10:18.853,Your Majesty should be forgiving towards her.
00:10:20.570,00:10:22.660,熹贵妃腹中的皇嗣才行啊,00:10:19.440,00:10:23.720,Or at least give consideration to the imperial heir in her belly.
00:10:23.330,00:10:25.440,你既说熹贵妃胡搅蛮缠,00:10:24.320,00:10:26.831,You said Noble Consort Lumière was pestering and harassing you.
00:10:26.200,00:10:30.370,那么熹贵妃到底是如何冲撞了呢,00:10:27.240,00:10:31.175,How exactly did she disrespect you?
00:10:31.380,00:10:35.340,当时就只有臣妾和熹贵妃两人,00:10:32.400,00:10:36.467,There were only the two of us in the chamber.
00:10:36.340,00:10:37.950,臣妾自知百口莫辩,00:10:37.360,00:10:39.778,I know I can hardly defend myself even with a hundred mouths.
00:10:39.050,00:10:40.840,但如果此事涉及臣妾,00:10:40.000,00:10:42.280,"However, I was involved in this incident"
00:10:41.340,00:10:44.090,都是因为有人想存心谋害臣妾,00:10:42.280,00:10:45.280,because someone had their heart set on framing me.
00:10:45.140,00:10:46.550,你觉得百口莫辩,00:10:46.200,00:10:48.520,You feel like you can't defend yourself even with a hundred mouths.
00:10:47.480,00:10:50.260,朕何尝不觉得百思不得其解,00:10:48.520,00:10:51.640,I feel that I can't understand this even with a hundred brains.
00:10:51.900,00:10:53.430,寝殿里只有你们两个人,,,
00:10:53.900,00:10:54.760,又起了争执,00:10:52.840,00:10:56.160,There were only the two of you inside and you had an argument.
00:10:56.530,00:10:58.020,你一向不喜欢熹贵妃,,,
00:10:58.360,00:10:59.650,这些朕都看在眼里,00:10:57.520,00:10:59.120,I've seen with my own eyes
00:11:00.410,00:11:02.990,倒是熹贵妃百般求全,00:10:59.120,00:11:01.064,how you've always disliked Noble Consort Lumière.
00:11:03.660,00:11:04.650,为皇后着想,00:11:01.400,00:11:05.920,"But she has made many compromises
for the good of the Empress."
00:11:07.200,00:11:10.320,皇上 臣妾有何理由要害熹贵妃,00:11:08.300,00:11:11.520,"Your Majesty, I have no reason to harm Noble Consort Lumière."
00:11:11.170,00:11:13.410,这些年 臣妾调度后宫,00:11:12.270,00:11:14.699,"For all these years that I've been managing the harem,"
00:11:13.750,00:11:16.740,皇上可曾见到臣妾蓄意害过谁吗,00:11:14.850,00:11:17.880,has Your Majesty ever seen me intentionally harm anyone?
00:11:17.260,00:11:18.340,你心中有数,,,
00:11:18.800,00:11:19.540,皇上,00:11:18.240,00:11:19.680,You know it in your heart.
,,,00:11:19.900,00:11:20.880,Your Majesty!
00:11:23.720,00:11:26.340,唐高宗的时候 武媚娘得宠,00:11:24.640,00:11:27.640,"During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang Dynasty,
Wu Meiniang was in high favor."
00:11:26.680,00:11:27.640,为除王皇后,,,
00:11:28.220,00:11:29.210,武媚娘亲手,00:11:27.680,00:11:29.200,"She wanted to take down Empress Wang,"
00:11:29.600,00:11:31.010,扼杀了在襁褓中的女婴,00:11:29.240,00:11:32.433,so she strangled her own daughter in the cradle
00:11:31.850,00:11:33.430,然后嫁祸给王皇后,,,
00:11:34.310,00:11:35.600,臣妾今日情状,00:11:32.790,00:11:35.236,and then accused Empress Wang of the murder.
00:11:35.900,00:11:37.860,恰如当年的王皇后啊,00:11:35.410,00:11:39.080,My current predicament is the same as that of Empress Wang.
00:11:39.320,00:11:40.150,皇上,00:11:40.420,00:11:41.440,Your Majesty...
00:11:41.610,00:11:45.150,皇后出言责怪 臣妾死不足惜,00:11:42.640,00:11:44.359,Her Majesty has placed her blame.
,,,00:11:44.721,00:11:46.240,My own death would not be lamentable.
00:11:46.280,00:11:47.900,只是臣妾的孩子,00:11:47.380,00:11:49.080,"However, my child..."
00:11:50.620,00:11:54.960,他还未睁开眼睛到这世上看一看,00:11:51.600,00:11:56.000,he did not even have the chance to open his eyes and see this world.
00:11:56.630,00:11:58.990,臣妾的孩子好无辜,00:11:57.730,00:12:00.160,My child was innocent and died unjustly.
00:12:07.600,00:12:09.380,胧月 你哭什么呀,00:12:08.520,00:12:10.680,"Longyue, why are you crying?"
00:12:11.310,00:12:12.920,我什么都没看见,00:12:12.410,00:12:14.120,I did not see anything...
00:12:13.310,00:12:15.270,我什么都没看见,00:12:14.200,00:12:16.200,I did not see anything...
00:12:17.820,00:12:18.470,你过来,00:12:18.760,00:12:19.760,Come here.
00:12:21.030,00:12:22.810,你看到了什么 告诉皇阿玛,00:12:22.000,00:12:24.030,What did you see? Tell your Imperial Father.
00:12:24.070,00:12:26.230,有皇阿玛在 什么都不用怕,00:12:25.000,00:12:27.410,Imperial Father is here. You have nothing to fear.
00:12:27.780,00:12:28.770,有皇额娘在,,,
00:12:29.080,00:12:30.690,告诉皇额娘发生了什么事,00:12:28.880,00:12:30.120,Your Imperial Mother is here.
00:12:31.040,00:12:32.780,不怕 告诉皇额娘啊,00:12:30.120,00:12:31.800,Tell Imperial Mother what happened.
,,,00:12:32.040,00:12:34.080,Don't be afraid. Tell me.
00:12:34.250,00:12:36.370,皇额娘她推了熹娘娘,00:12:35.280,00:12:37.480,Imperial Mother pushed Mother Lumière!
00:12:36.830,00:12:38.830,她推了熹娘娘,00:12:37.840,00:12:39.880,She pushed Mother Lumière!
00:12:39.460,00:12:41.540,你瞎说 是你教她的,00:12:40.520,00:12:42.640,Nonsense! You taught her to say that!
00:12:42.340,00:12:43.750,说 是不是你教她的,00:12:43.400,00:12:44.960,"Say it! You taught her to defame me, didn't you!"
00:12:44.380,00:12:46.420,要不是你 敬贵妃 是你,00:12:45.400,00:12:47.600,"Otherwise, it was you! Noble Consort Estime!"
00:12:47.050,00:12:48.010,皇后娘娘 你,00:12:48.040,00:12:49.200,"Your Majesty, you..."
00:12:48.390,00:12:50.630,皇上 臣妾冤枉啊,00:12:49.440,00:12:51.680,"I'm wrongfully accused, Your Majesty."
00:12:51.020,00:12:53.760,事发突然 臣妾怎能未卜先知,00:12:52.040,00:12:53.280,This was an accident.
00:12:53.980,00:12:55.810,怎能叫胧月说这些呢,00:12:53.280,00:12:56.910,How could I have foreseen it and told Longyue to say that?
00:12:59.730,00:13:00.850,她只有六岁,00:13:00.640,00:13:02.306,She is only six years old.
00:13:02.030,00:13:03.060,她能撒谎吗,00:13:03.000,00:13:04.398,Is she capable of lying?
00:13:05.780,00:13:07.570,况且熹贵妃刚刚醒,00:13:06.760,00:13:08.880,"Besides, Noble Consort Lumière has just woken up."
00:13:07.990,00:13:08.860,谁会教她,,,
00:13:09.530,00:13:10.240,皇上,00:13:09.000,00:13:10.351,Who could teach Longyue this lie?
00:13:11.080,00:13:13.910,此事臣妾便如当年的王皇后,00:13:10.560,00:13:11.560,Your Majesty!
00:13:14.330,00:13:15.120,给人陷害,00:13:12.080,00:13:16.200,I have been defamed just like Empress Wang.
00:13:15.460,00:13:16.620,朕不是唐高宗,00:13:16.480,00:13:18.186,I am not Emperor Gaozong.
00:13:17.380,00:13:18.660,不会被轻易蒙蔽,00:13:18.400,00:13:20.000,I'm not fooled so easily!
00:13:19.170,00:13:21.830,倒是你一直视嬛嬛为死敌,00:13:20.200,00:13:22.930,You have always viewed Huan Huan as your mortal enemy.
00:13:22.130,00:13:23.340,必欲除之而后快,00:13:23.000,00:13:24.820,You would be more than happy to eliminate her.
00:13:23.720,00:13:25.960,臣妾以乌拉那拉氏先祖发誓,00:13:24.820,00:13:27.040,"I swear in the names of my Ula-Nara ancestors,"
00:13:26.380,00:13:28.120,臣妾并未做过任何,,,
00:13:28.390,00:13:30.130,伤害熹贵妃腹中胎儿之事,00:13:27.400,00:13:31.200,"I have never done anything to harm
Noble Consort Lumière's unborn child."
00:13:30.560,00:13:31.340,这样的毒誓,,,
00:13:32.390,00:13:34.880,你还是冲着太后的神位去发吧,00:13:31.560,00:13:36.245,"Why don't you take this oath in front of
the late Empress Dowager's Heavenly tablet?"
00:13:36.810,00:13:38.850,皇后心肠歹毒,,,
00:13:39.610,00:13:40.590,残害皇嗣,00:13:37.800,00:13:41.880,The Empress has a vicious heart and cruelly harmed an imperial heir.
00:13:41.770,00:13:42.480,即日起,00:13:42.800,00:13:44.280,"From this day onwards,"
00:13:43.940,00:13:45.770,不许踏出景仁宫一步,00:13:44.800,00:13:47.240,she is banned from stepping out of the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:13:49.160,00:13:49.740,苏培盛,,,
00:13:50.330,00:13:50.910,奴才在,00:13:50.200,00:13:51.160,Su Peisheng.
00:13:51.080,00:13:51.560,带走,00:13:51.280,00:13:52.120,Your Majesty.
00:13:52.450,00:13:52.990,嗻,00:13:52.200,00:13:53.200,Take her away.
00:13:55.330,00:13:56.040,皇后娘娘,00:13:53.600,00:13:54.520,Aye.
00:13:57.540,00:13:59.410,请吧 皇后娘娘,00:13:56.520,00:13:57.920,Your Majesty.
,,,00:13:58.640,00:14:00.991,"Please, Your Majesty."
00:14:22.400,00:14:25.190,皇上 恕臣多嘴,00:14:23.500,00:14:26.290,"Your Majesty, pardon me for asking."
00:14:25.740,00:14:27.320,皇后的事果真,,,
00:14:27.650,00:14:28.390,你是老臣,00:14:26.840,00:14:28.571,Is it true that the Empress...
00:14:29.280,00:14:30.650,问一句也是应该的,00:14:28.750,00:14:30.280,You have served as an official for a long time.
00:14:31.990,00:14:33.570,朕已经细细查问,00:14:30.380,00:14:32.160,It's only right that you have concerns.
00:14:34.660,00:14:36.150,皇后无从狡辩,00:14:33.090,00:14:35.191,I have thoroughly investigated this matter.
00:14:36.950,00:14:37.490,皇上,00:14:35.760,00:14:37.467,The Empress has no defense.
00:14:38.330,00:14:41.320,皇后虽然不及已故的纯元皇后,00:14:38.050,00:14:38.880,Your Majesty.
00:14:41.580,00:14:42.370,那么宽和,00:14:39.430,00:14:43.751,"Although the Empress is not as benevolent
as the late Empress Première,"
00:14:42.840,00:14:44.620,但到底不是作恶的人,,,
00:14:44.920,00:14:46.040,从前许多事,00:14:43.940,00:14:45.720,Her Majesty is not a malicious person.
00:14:47.010,00:14:48.370,朕并非没有疑心,00:14:46.020,00:14:48.040,There were many other incidents in the past...
00:14:49.430,00:14:50.710,只是不愿意计较,00:14:48.110,00:14:50.226,It's not that I didn't have my suspicions.
00:14:52.300,00:14:53.170,可是这件事,00:14:50.530,00:14:52.480,I just did not want to bother.
00:14:54.220,00:14:55.840,皇后已经无从抵赖,00:14:53.400,00:14:54.685,"But as for this incident,"
,,,00:14:55.320,00:14:57.541,the Empress has no credible defense.
00:14:57.310,00:15:00.550,皇后好好的 费这个心思做什么,00:14:58.410,00:15:01.810,But why would Her Majesty go to such lengths?
00:15:00.900,00:15:02.060,欲壑难填,00:15:02.000,00:15:03.841,"""Desire is a ravine one cannot fill."""
00:15:03.560,00:15:04.720,贪心不足,00:15:04.660,00:15:06.670,"“A greedy heart is never satisfied."""
00:15:05.980,00:15:07.020,皇后不够,00:15:07.080,00:15:08.591,"Now she's the Empress,"
00:15:07.690,00:15:10.060,还盼着做个名正言顺的太后,00:15:08.790,00:15:11.160,so she expects to be the legitimate Empress Dowager.
00:15:11.410,00:15:13.110,朕将三阿哥交给她,00:15:12.510,00:15:14.361,I entrusted the Third Prince to her.
00:15:13.570,00:15:15.530,倒让她多了许多非分之想,00:15:14.670,00:15:16.630,And it caused her to form improper ideas.
00:15:15.950,00:15:16.990,皇上明鉴,,,
00:15:17.620,00:15:18.860,来日谁登基,00:15:17.050,00:15:18.316,Your Majesty is wise.
,,,00:15:18.720,00:15:20.224,"Yet, whoever succeeds the throne,"
00:15:19.580,00:15:22.490,皇后都是母后皇太后,00:15:20.680,00:15:23.590,Her Majesty will always be the Imperial Mother Empress Dowager.
00:15:23.170,00:15:25.910,权柄下移 她怎么肯,00:15:24.270,00:15:27.010,How could she willingly let her power slip from her grasp?
00:15:26.920,00:15:29.880,那皇上打算如何处置,00:15:28.020,00:15:30.980,Then... how does Your Majesty plan to proceed?
00:15:34.260,00:15:37.720,臣最近听说 宫内流言四起,00:15:35.360,00:15:38.820,I have heard rumors are arising in the palace.
00:15:38.770,00:15:40.180,原本有许多孩子,,,
00:15:40.520,00:15:42.050,都死在皇后手中,00:15:39.870,00:15:41.431,Claiming that many children
,,,00:15:41.620,00:15:43.414,died at Her Majesty's hands.
00:15:42.900,00:15:45.640,可是流言终究是流言,00:15:44.000,00:15:46.740,But rumors are just rumors in the end.
00:15:46.190,00:15:49.060,就像皇后只能是皇后,00:15:47.290,00:15:50.160,Just as only the Empress will always be the Empress.
00:15:49.990,00:15:52.770,中宫易主 会生大变,00:15:51.090,00:15:54.088,"Changing the head of the harem will have
a far-reaching impact."
00:15:54.160,00:15:55.570,朕还没有这么想,00:15:55.260,00:15:57.102,My thoughts have not gone there yet.
00:15:56.330,00:15:59.440,后宫稳固是大清之幸,00:15:57.430,00:16:00.540,A stable harem is a blessing to the Great Qing.
00:16:01.460,00:16:03.410,不过朕会令皇后思过,00:16:02.560,00:16:04.623,"But I will ask the Empress to reflect on her wrongdoings,"
00:16:04.580,00:16:05.570,严惩此事,00:16:05.680,00:16:06.821,and the punishment will be stern.
00:16:18.680,00:16:20.720,娘娘喝口茶 歇一会儿吧,00:16:19.780,00:16:21.820,"Your Highness, please have some tea and take a rest."
00:16:25.060,00:16:27.720,念得再多也抵消不了,00:16:26.160,00:16:28.172,"No matter how much I recite the sutras,"
00:16:27.940,00:16:29.810,我对那孩子心头的愧悔,00:16:28.172,00:16:30.910,it cannot redeem my regret and shame for the child.
00:16:30.110,00:16:31.650,娘娘不也是不得已吗,00:16:31.210,00:16:33.090,It was against Your Highness's own will.
00:16:35.950,00:16:36.860,孩子没了,00:16:37.050,00:16:38.488,The child is no more.
00:16:38.030,00:16:40.450,那是他跟娘娘命中的缘分太浅,00:16:39.130,00:16:41.814,That is because his fate was only gently linked with that of Your Highness.
00:16:43.460,00:16:44.790,现在最要紧的是,,,
00:16:46.000,00:16:47.710,皇上虽然拘禁了皇后,00:16:44.560,00:16:46.560,The most important matter at hand is that
00:16:48.000,00:16:49.210,但是并未惩罚,00:16:47.100,00:16:48.923,"although His Majesty has confined the Empress,"
00:16:49.960,00:16:51.500,皇后是三阿哥的养母,00:16:49.100,00:16:50.838,His Majesty did not announce any punishment.
00:16:52.380,00:16:53.460,太后的至亲,00:16:51.060,00:16:52.940,"The Empress is the foster mother of the Third Prince,"
,,,00:16:53.480,00:16:55.541,and a close relative of the late Empress Dowager.
00:16:55.180,00:16:56.340,要连根拔起,00:16:56.280,00:16:57.968,"For her to be pulled out by the roots,"
00:16:58.390,00:17:00.170,咱们就得让她无依无傍,00:16:59.490,00:17:01.592,we need to leave her with no one to rely on.
00:17:06.940,00:17:08.770,额娘 夜里凉,00:17:07.748,00:17:09.870,"Mother, it's cold at night."
00:17:09.360,00:17:10.520,您别跪着伤了身子,,,
00:17:11.320,00:17:12.480,儿子叫人炖了燕窝,00:17:10.460,00:17:12.110,Kneeling can damage your health.
00:17:13.360,00:17:14.020,您起来喝,00:17:12.420,00:17:13.920,I have had this bird's nest soup made for you.
,,,00:17:14.460,00:17:15.799,Please get up and have some.
00:17:16.820,00:17:18.530,真是难为你的孝心了,00:17:17.920,00:17:19.630,I appreciate your filial heart.
00:17:24.040,00:17:24.570,儿子知道,,,
00:17:24.790,00:17:26.400,额娘在为未出世的弟弟伤心,00:17:24.876,00:17:27.815,I know that Mother is heartbroken over my unborn little brother.
00:17:27.380,00:17:28.990,所以和富察氏抄了经幡,,,
00:17:29.500,00:17:30.240,烧给弟弟,00:17:28.480,00:17:30.400,My wife Fuca and I copied this sutra
00:17:30.960,00:17:32.170,希望他早登极乐,00:17:30.600,00:17:31.566,to burn for him.
,,,00:17:32.060,00:17:33.737,We wish he will soon enter the Pure Land.
00:17:34.050,00:17:35.540,你和富察氏辛苦了,00:17:35.150,00:17:36.829,You and Fuca have worked hard.
00:17:36.180,00:17:38.260,额娘病了 儿子不能分担,00:17:37.280,00:17:39.360,"Mother, you're ill and I can't share your pain."
00:17:39.100,00:17:40.210,实在心急如焚,00:17:40.200,00:17:41.600,My heart is fuming with anxiety.
00:17:42.680,00:17:43.970,额娘知道你孝顺,00:17:43.780,00:17:45.334,I know you're a filial son.
00:17:46.440,00:17:47.720,三阿哥近日如何,,,
00:17:49.020,00:17:50.600,听说三哥在为皇额娘的事,00:17:47.540,00:17:49.273,How has the Third Prince been?
00:17:50.860,00:17:51.720,向皇阿玛求情,00:17:50.120,00:17:52.979,"I heard my Third Brother has been pleading with Imperial Father
 for mercy on Imperial Mother."
00:17:52.480,00:17:54.020,结果遭到皇阿玛的训斥,00:17:53.580,00:17:55.648,But Imperial Father scolded him.
00:17:56.530,00:18:00.570,三阿哥是皇后抚养的儿子,00:17:57.630,00:18:01.670,The Third Prince ... was brought up by the Empress.
00:18:01.530,00:18:02.770,如今皇后被责,00:18:02.630,00:18:04.285,"Now that the Empress is punished,"
00:18:03.910,00:18:05.200,你也要与他少来往,00:18:05.010,00:18:06.677,you should associate with him less.
00:18:05.870,00:18:06.530,是,00:18:06.970,00:18:07.630,Yes.
00:18:07.120,00:18:09.490,三阿哥与皇额娘互为依靠,00:18:08.220,00:18:10.930,The Third Prince and Imperial Mother depend on each other
00:18:09.830,00:18:10.540,唇齿相依,,,
00:18:11.460,00:18:12.290,儿子明白,00:18:10.930,00:18:12.350,"""as close as teeth and lips."""
00:18:12.880,00:18:13.660,自然了,00:18:12.560,00:18:13.503,I understand.
00:18:14.710,00:18:16.000,有皇后一天,00:18:13.980,00:18:14.986,"Of course,"
00:18:16.470,00:18:18.080,三阿哥就有登基之望,00:18:15.810,00:18:17.326,each day with the Empress
,,,00:18:17.570,00:18:19.671,gives the Third Prince a chance to succeed to the throne.
00:18:19.390,00:18:23.920,有三阿哥一天 皇后就多重依靠,00:18:20.490,00:18:25.020,"And each day with the Third Prince
gives the Empress another layer of support."
00:18:24.430,00:18:26.550,是 儿子知道了,00:18:25.530,00:18:27.650,"Yes, I understand, Mother."
00:18:35.070,00:18:36.400,四弟一向最用功了,,,
00:18:36.820,00:18:38.230,连娶了福晋都不放松,00:18:36.170,00:18:37.920,"Fourth Brother, you've always been the most diligent."
00:18:38.530,00:18:39.810,今儿怎么有空站在这儿啊,00:18:37.920,00:18:39.630,"Even after marriage, you don't ever relax."
00:18:40.570,00:18:41.610,今儿是八叔生辰,00:18:39.630,00:18:41.400,How do you have leisure to stand around today?
00:18:42.200,00:18:43.660,我去宗人府的大狱看他了,00:18:41.670,00:18:43.125,Today is Eighth Uncle's birthday.
00:18:45.580,00:18:46.610,你敢去看八叔,00:18:43.300,00:18:45.477,I went to visit him in the prison of the Imperial Clan Court.
00:18:47.830,00:18:48.690,不怕被人看见,00:18:46.680,00:18:48.502,You were so bold as to visit Eighth Uncle?
00:18:49.170,00:18:50.580,旁人问起我自然不说,00:18:48.930,00:18:50.270,You weren't afraid of being seen?
,,,00:18:50.270,00:18:51.831,I wouldn't tell if anyone else asks.
00:18:51.170,00:18:53.750,您是我三哥 做弟弟的不敢相瞒,00:18:52.270,00:18:54.850,"But as your younger brother, I wouldn't keep secrets from you."
00:18:54.800,00:18:57.080,那八叔近来如何啊,00:18:55.900,00:18:58.180,So ... Has Eighth Uncle been well?
00:18:59.090,00:18:59.800,还能如何,00:19:00.000,00:19:01.089,How can he be well?
00:19:00.180,00:19:02.170,削爵囚禁 生不如死,00:19:01.280,00:19:03.270,"He's imprisoned, living worse than death."
00:19:03.010,00:19:05.750,三哥 为弟的有句话一直想说,00:19:04.110,00:19:07.076,"Third Brother, there's something I've always wanted to tell you,"
00:19:06.520,00:19:07.470,不知是否得当,00:19:07.432,00:19:08.835,but I wonder if it's appropriate.
00:19:07.770,00:19:09.880,你我兄弟客气什么 说,00:19:08.870,00:19:10.980,We're brothers. Don't feel like a stranger. Tell me.
00:19:12.100,00:19:13.390,皇阿玛因继位之事,,,
00:19:13.650,00:19:14.560,圈禁了数位宗亲,00:19:13.200,00:19:14.750,"After the fight for the throne,"
00:19:15.020,00:19:16.640,八叔也好 十四叔也好,00:19:14.750,00:19:16.000,Imperial Father had numerous clansmen locked up.
00:19:16.980,00:19:18.100,都是皇阿玛的手足,00:19:16.120,00:19:17.740,"Whether Eighth Uncle or Fourteenth Uncle,"
00:19:19.360,00:19:21.350,若我们能为八叔和十四叔求情,00:19:18.080,00:19:20.000,"they were both as close to Imperial Father as ""arms and legs."""
00:19:21.660,00:19:23.020,让他们得到皇阿玛宽宥,00:19:20.460,00:19:22.450,If we can intercede on behalf of our uncles
00:19:23.490,00:19:25.360,那么既保全了皇阿玛的千古名声,00:19:22.600,00:19:24.480,"and have Imperial Father's mercy bestowed on them,"
,,,00:19:24.590,00:19:26.560,that would preserve Imperial Father's reputation -
00:19:25.950,00:19:28.320,不致百年之后任人议论手足相残,00:19:27.050,00:19:29.646,"and a century from now, people won't say he
""destroyed his own arms and legs."""
00:19:29.080,00:19:31.120,更能使太后在九泉之下安息,00:19:30.180,00:19:32.220,"Also, this will bring peace to
the Empress Dowager under the Nine Springs."
00:19:32.000,00:19:33.490,下个月便是先帝的生辰,,,
00:19:34.250,00:19:35.040,假如有机会,00:19:33.100,00:19:34.892,Next month is the birth anniversary of the prior emperor.
00:19:36.000,00:19:37.410,我想在那日求得皇阿玛,00:19:35.350,00:19:36.668,"If I get the chance that day,"
00:19:37.760,00:19:39.090,对八叔和十四叔的宽恕,00:19:37.100,00:19:40.160,"I want to plead for Imperial Father's pardon on
Eighth Uncle and Fourteenth Uncle."
00:19:39.800,00:19:41.040,这也是对先帝和太后,,,
00:19:41.340,00:19:42.130,最大的孝心了,00:19:40.900,00:19:43.464,"This is also the most filial tribute
to the late prior emperor and the Empress Dowager."
00:19:43.890,00:19:45.090,四弟用心良苦啊,00:19:44.990,00:19:46.831,"You have very noble intentions, Fourth Brother."
00:19:46.310,00:19:47.510,愚兄居然没有想到,00:19:47.410,00:19:49.139,"I'm so foolish, this didn't even cross my mind."
00:19:48.560,00:19:51.640,好 那日我若得到机会,00:19:49.660,00:19:52.740,"All right. If I get the chance on that day,"
00:19:52.020,00:19:53.010,一定向皇阿玛求情,,,
00:19:53.400,00:19:54.100,劝服皇阿玛,00:19:53.120,00:19:55.200,I'll certainly plead with Imperial Father for clemency.
00:19:54.560,00:19:55.140,好,00:19:55.660,00:19:56.391,Good.
00:19:57.650,00:19:58.730,娘娘喝杯茶吧,00:19:58.881,00:20:00.000,"Have some tea, Your Majesty."
00:20:02.070,00:20:06.160,娘娘 皇上说还不让您出去,00:20:03.170,00:20:07.260,His Majesty said you still can't go out yet.
00:20:07.540,00:20:08.990,您陪伴皇上这么多年,00:20:08.640,00:20:10.694,Your Majesty has accompanied His Majesty for so many years...
00:20:09.870,00:20:11.580,禁足可是从没有过的事,00:20:10.970,00:20:12.680,but you were never confined.
00:20:12.580,00:20:16.320,熹贵妃这样得宠 也被禁足多次,00:20:13.680,00:20:17.420,"Noble Consort Lumière enjoys high favor,
yet she's been confined many times."
00:20:17.550,00:20:20.630,本宫是皇后 自然能承受,00:20:18.650,00:20:21.730,I am the Empress. I can endure it.

00:20:22.220,00:20:24.800,对了 听说三阿哥为娘娘求情了,00:20:23.320,00:20:25.900,"By the way, I heard that the Third Prince
interceded for Your Majesty"
00:20:25.430,00:20:27.040,但却遭到了皇上的训斥,00:20:26.530,00:20:28.140,but invoked His Majesty's rebuke.
00:20:28.220,00:20:29.460,三阿哥真是愚蠢,00:20:29.320,00:20:30.749,The Third Prince is truly stupid.
00:20:29.930,00:20:32.010,这个时候自然是自保为上,00:20:31.030,00:20:33.110,His priority right now should be protecting himself.
00:20:32.520,00:20:35.310,娘娘 三阿哥也是一片孝心哪,00:20:33.620,00:20:36.410,"Your Majesty, the Third Prince was just being filial."
00:20:35.560,00:20:36.470,孝心用得不当,,,
00:20:36.690,00:20:38.100,便是害人害己的糊涂心,00:20:36.660,00:20:39.238,"If a filial heart is misused, it can harm himself and others!"
00:20:41.190,00:20:43.350,现在就指望先帝生辰那日,00:20:42.290,00:20:44.639,"I can only hope that on the prior emperor's birth anniversary,"
00:20:44.030,00:20:45.360,三阿哥能够争气,00:20:45.130,00:20:46.720,the Third Prince will meet my expectations.
00:20:47.370,00:20:48.950,只要三阿哥能有来日,00:20:48.470,00:20:50.276,"As long as the Third Prince has a future,"
00:20:49.740,00:20:51.990,本宫也就不白受这些委屈了,00:20:50.840,00:20:53.090,all my suffering will not be in vain.

00:21:27.490,00:21:30.610,先帝的祭礼办得很是妥帖,00:21:28.590,00:21:31.710,The prior emperor's ceremony was befitting.
00:21:32.870,00:21:33.990,多谢皇阿玛夸奖,00:21:33.970,00:21:35.316,"Thank you for your praise, Imperial Father."
00:21:36.000,00:21:38.240,你办得好朕都看在眼里,00:21:37.100,00:21:39.340,I saw the efforts you've made.
00:21:40.420,00:21:43.880,对了 听说前些日子,00:21:41.520,00:21:44.980,"By the way, I heard that recently"
00:21:44.380,00:21:46.870,你去了宗人府看了允撰几次,00:21:45.480,00:21:47.970,you've visited your Eighth Uncle a few times.
00:21:48.050,00:21:48.960,是,00:21:49.150,00:21:50.060,Yes.
00:21:50.100,00:21:53.050,八叔他现在很可怜,00:21:51.200,00:21:54.150,Eighth Uncle ... He is pitiful.
00:21:55.480,00:21:57.260,你很宅心仁厚啊,00:21:56.580,00:21:58.360,You do have benevolence residing in your heart.
00:21:58.400,00:22:00.930,皇阿玛 八叔犯下大错,00:21:59.500,00:22:02.030,"Imperial Father, Eighth Uncle made a grave mistake."
00:22:01.570,00:22:02.980,怎么罚都是应当的,00:22:02.670,00:22:04.382,Any punishment is justified.
00:22:03.860,00:22:05.720,只是先帝膝下诸子,00:22:04.960,00:22:07.046,It's just that all the sons of the prior emperor

00:22:10.530,00:22:13.700,一定想看到父慈子孝 兄友弟恭,00:22:11.630,00:22:14.800,he'd want to see filial piety and brotherly love.
00:22:15.450,00:22:16.110,还有呢,,,

00:22:18.710,00:22:19.620,还有十四叔,00:22:17.930,00:22:18.892,And ...
00:22:20.380,00:22:23.160,皇阿玛 十四叔是儿臣的亲叔叔,00:22:19.810,00:22:20.984,And Fourteenth Uncle.
00:22:23.460,00:22:24.670,皇阿玛的同胞兄弟,00:22:21.480,00:22:25.760,"Imperial Father, Fourteenth Uncle is your brother by birth,
and the nearest uncle to me."
00:22:25.550,00:22:26.660,可一直被圈禁,,,
00:22:27.510,00:22:28.920,儿臣记得先帝在时,00:22:26.650,00:22:28.213,But he's been confined all this time.
00:22:29.430,00:22:30.460,十三叔被圈禁,00:22:28.610,00:22:30.020,When the prior emperor
,,,00:22:30.304,00:22:31.937,"confined Thirteenth Uncle,"
00:22:31.010,00:22:33.130,皇阿玛尚且苦苦向先帝求情,00:22:32.110,00:22:34.230,you pleaded earnestly for him.
00:22:33.720,00:22:35.710,不如看在先帝的份儿上,00:22:34.820,00:22:36.810,"For the sake of the prior emperor,"
00:22:36.390,00:22:37.760,也放了十四叔出来吧,00:22:37.490,00:22:39.350,what if you released Fourteenth Uncle?
00:22:39.900,00:22:41.640,你倒惦记着你的叔叔们,,,
00:22:41.940,00:22:42.680,儿臣不敢,00:22:41.000,00:22:42.853,I see you've been worrying about your uncles.
00:22:43.230,00:22:44.390,只是儿臣听说,00:22:43.040,00:22:43.893,I dare not.
,,,00:22:44.330,00:22:45.490,It's just that I heard ...
00:22:45.190,00:22:47.900,太后病重时很想念十四叔,00:22:46.290,00:22:49.200,"when the Empress Dowager was gravely ill,
she missed Fourteenth Uncle very much."
00:22:49.110,00:22:49.820,儿臣想,00:22:50.210,00:22:51.222,I was thinking
00:22:50.450,00:22:53.360,若当时能让十四叔出来的话,00:22:51.550,00:22:54.460,if Fourteenth Uncle were allowed to visit back then...
00:22:53.620,00:22:55.110,你十四叔出来了,,,
00:22:55.450,00:22:56.940,太后的病就能好了吗,00:22:54.720,00:22:56.361,"If your Fourteenth Uncle visited,"
,,,00:22:56.550,00:22:58.568,would the Empress Dowager's illness have been cured?
00:22:58.750,00:23:01.240,你觉得朕对太后不孝是吗,00:22:59.850,00:23:02.340,Do you think I'm unfilial to the Empress Dowager?
00:23:03.090,00:23:03.790,儿臣不敢,,,
00:23:04.040,00:23:04.950,你不敢,00:23:04.190,00:23:05.040,I don't dare.
,,,00:23:05.140,00:23:06.050,You don't dare?
00:23:06.460,00:23:09.130,方才的兄友弟恭不是你说的吗,00:23:07.560,00:23:10.230,Weren't you just speaking of brotherly love?
00:23:10.090,00:23:11.050,朕不友爱,00:23:11.190,00:23:12.339,"I am not loving,"
00:23:11.470,00:23:14.510,所以也难怪朕的弟弟都不恭敬,00:23:12.570,00:23:15.610,so no wonder my brothers don't respect me.
00:23:15.600,00:23:16.800,父慈子孝,00:23:16.700,00:23:18.240,"""When a father is loving, his son is filial."""
00:23:17.770,00:23:18.680,朕不慈爱,00:23:18.870,00:23:20.157,"I am not loving,"
00:23:19.270,00:23:21.430,所以你也就不孝顺了,00:23:20.370,00:23:22.756,so there's no need for you to be filial?
00:23:22.190,00:23:23.180,儿臣不是这个意思,00:23:23.290,00:23:24.544,That isn't what I meant.
00:23:24.770,00:23:25.390,皇阿玛,00:23:25.870,00:23:26.754,Imperial Father.
00:23:26.480,00:23:29.070,儿臣是为了您的名声着想,00:23:27.580,00:23:30.170,I was thinking for your reputation.
00:23:30.450,00:23:31.190,皇阿玛,,,
00:23:31.950,00:23:33.610,皇叔们再有错,00:23:31.550,00:23:32.554,"Imperial Father,"
00:23:34.580,00:23:35.690,到底是您的兄弟,00:23:33.050,00:23:35.012,"whatever my uncles have done,"
00:23:36.660,00:23:37.900,皇额娘再不好,00:23:35.680,00:23:37.205,they are your brothers after all.
00:23:38.580,00:23:39.570,也是您的妻室,00:23:37.760,00:23:39.302,"Whatever Imperial Mother has done,"
,,,00:23:39.680,00:23:40.972,she is still your wife.
00:23:40.870,00:23:42.660,皇阿玛一时之怒不要紧,00:23:41.970,00:23:44.024,I can withstand your momentary anger.
00:23:43.500,00:23:45.740,可要为百年名声思虑啊,00:23:44.600,00:23:46.840,But I must think about your legacy down the centuries.
00:23:46.630,00:23:49.040,您圈禁兄弟 禁足妻室,00:23:47.730,00:23:50.480,You've imprisoned your brothers and confined your wife.
00:23:49.670,00:23:50.580,臣民惶恐,00:23:50.770,00:23:51.869,The people are frightened -
00:23:51.970,00:23:53.300,不知要如何揣测呢,00:23:53.070,00:23:54.589,what will your subjects think about you?
00:23:54.090,00:23:55.630,臣民如何揣测,00:23:55.190,00:23:56.956,What will my subjects think?
00:23:57.770,00:24:01.260,朕看你是要来做朕的主了,00:23:58.870,00:23:59.908,It seems that
,,,00:24:00.398,00:24:02.473,you want to be my master now.

00:24:05.310,00:24:06.650,可是你不辨是非,00:24:06.410,00:24:08.099,Yet you can't discern right from wrong

00:24:11.860,00:24:13.070,就是这样一个暴君吗,00:24:11.670,00:24:12.660,"In your eyes,"
,,,00:24:12.960,00:24:14.170,am I such a tyrant?
00:24:13.990,00:24:16.320,还是你看不惯朕的所作所为,00:24:15.090,00:24:17.420,Or you cannot tolerate my rule
00:24:16.660,00:24:18.200,急于取而代之了呢,,,

00:24:21.580,00:24:22.620,朕登基之初,00:24:21.350,00:24:22.231,I dare not!

00:24:26.340,00:24:28.620,是如何处处刁难 不恭不敬,00:24:27.440,00:24:29.720,disrespected me and found fault with everything I did.
00:24:29.050,00:24:30.750,你都是亲眼看在眼里的,00:24:30.150,00:24:31.850,You saw it all very well!
00:24:32.170,00:24:34.340,今日 你反而反过来,00:24:33.270,00:24:35.440,"Yet today, you've switched sides and turned against me."
00:24:34.720,00:24:36.500,要替害朕的人来求情,00:24:35.820,00:24:37.751,You're interceding for those who wished to harm me.
00:24:38.260,00:24:41.100,与他们沆灿一气 来性逆朕,00:24:39.360,00:24:42.200,"You've joined their ""filthy breath"" to disobey me."
00:24:43.940,00:24:47.550,至于你皇额娘 朕为何要圈禁她,00:24:45.040,00:24:48.650,"As for why I confined your Imperial Mother,"
00:24:49.020,00:24:51.440,不单单是为了熹贵妃腹中之子,00:24:50.120,00:24:52.540,it was not only for Noble Consort Lumiere's unborn son.
00:24:52.900,00:24:56.270,这些日子 你皇额娘奔走牵线,00:24:54.000,00:24:57.370,Your Imperial Mother has been pulling many threads
00:24:56.870,00:24:58.450,只盼你成为太子呢,00:24:57.970,00:25:00.000,hoping to make you the Crown Prince!
00:25:05.330,00:25:05.910,皇阿玛,,,
00:25:06.130,00:25:07.580,亏你还喊得出皇阿玛,00:25:06.241,00:25:07.230,Imperial Father...
00:25:08.630,00:25:09.740,你是朕的长子,00:25:07.230,00:25:08.793,So you still call me Father!
00:25:10.170,00:25:12.040,虽然软弱 也不具才干,00:25:09.730,00:25:11.104,You are my eldest son.
00:25:13.220,00:25:14.670,可是朕一直对你,00:25:11.270,00:25:13.140,"Although you lack strength and competence,"
00:25:14.970,00:25:16.830,处处管教 处处优容,00:25:14.320,00:25:17.920,I have always taught you and been forgiving towards you.
00:25:18.180,00:25:19.090,天不垂怜,,,
00:25:19.930,00:25:21.550,竟然教出个别人的儿子,00:25:19.280,00:25:20.642,Heaven had no mercy.
00:25:22.270,00:25:23.970,你既然要为你八叔求情,00:25:21.030,00:25:23.039,I've made you become someone else's son!
00:25:24.350,00:25:25.470,就去做他的儿子好了,00:25:23.370,00:25:25.145,"If you want to plead for your Eighth Uncle,"
00:25:27.270,00:25:27.980,皇阿玛,00:25:25.450,00:25:26.759,why don't you be his son?
00:25:29.730,00:25:30.770,您再生气也罢,00:25:28.370,00:25:29.268,"Imperial Father,"
00:25:32.440,00:25:33.650,难道不要儿臣了吗,00:25:30.830,00:25:32.171,"however angry you are,"
00:25:33.900,00:25:35.270,是你要弃朕而去,00:25:33.540,00:25:34.750,you wouldn't disown your own son.
00:25:35.740,00:25:36.650,不是朕不要你,00:25:35.000,00:25:36.559,It was you who abandoned me as your father.
,,,00:25:36.840,00:25:38.146,Not the other way around!
00:25:39.070,00:25:40.410,苏培盛 奴才在,00:25:40.170,00:25:41.510,"- Su Peisheng!
- Your Majesty."
00:25:40.580,00:25:43.990,传旨 弘时为人 断不可留在宫中,00:25:41.680,00:25:45.090,"Announce my decree:
Hongshi lacks the integrity to stay in the palace."
00:25:45.500,00:25:47.410,他既偏帮允撰,00:25:46.600,00:25:48.510,"Since he is loyal to Yunsi,"
00:25:48.380,00:25:50.330,就让他去做允撰的儿子,00:25:49.480,00:25:51.694,he will become Yunsi's son.
00:25:51.300,00:25:54.250,允撰因罪已撒去了黄带子,00:25:52.400,00:25:55.350,"Due to his crimes, Yunsi was stripped of his Imperial Belt"
00:25:54.760,00:25:56.090,玉牒内已除其名,00:25:55.860,00:25:57.440,and his name was removed from the imperial pedigree.
00:25:56.840,00:25:58.300,弘时作为他的儿子,00:25:57.940,00:25:59.551,"Hongshi, as his son,"
00:25:59.050,00:26:00.710,岂能不撒去黄带子呢,00:26:00.150,00:26:01.923,must also lose his Imperial Belt.
00:26:01.060,00:26:03.510,即刻撒去弘时的黄带子,00:26:02.160,00:26:04.610,Immediately confiscate Hongshi's Imperial Belt.
00:26:04.140,00:26:06.300,交给恒亲王约束养赡,00:26:05.240,00:26:07.400,His Eighth Uncle Lord Heng will foster and discipline him.
00:26:06.940,00:26:09.390,朕已经没有这个儿子了,00:26:08.040,00:26:10.490,I no longer have this son!
00:26:10.310,00:26:10.970,皇上,,,
00:26:11.230,00:26:11.970,还不快去,00:26:11.410,00:26:12.200,Your Majesty...
,,,00:26:12.200,00:26:13.506,What are you waiting for!
00:26:14.190,00:26:14.850,遵旨,00:26:15.290,00:26:16.320,I obey.
00:26:37.630,00:26:38.340,娘娘,,,
00:26:38.720,00:26:39.580,娘娘 出事了,00:26:38.730,00:26:39.720,Your Majesty!
00:26:40.340,00:26:41.250,又怎么了,00:26:39.820,00:26:40.680,Terrible news.
00:26:41.510,00:26:42.340,三阿哥他,00:26:41.440,00:26:42.480,What is it now?
00:26:42.680,00:26:43.790,说错话了是吧,00:26:42.610,00:26:43.600,"Third Prince, he..."
,,,00:26:43.780,00:26:44.890,He misspoke today?
00:26:44.560,00:26:46.890,皇上现在不放本宫也无所谓,00:26:45.660,00:26:47.990,It doesn't matter if His Majesty keeps me confined for now.
00:26:47.230,00:26:49.510,最重要的 他还是念着姐姐,00:26:48.330,00:26:50.610,"What matters is he still considers my sister,"
00:26:50.270,00:26:52.930,那本宫还有东山再起的一天,00:26:51.370,00:26:54.143,and that gives me the chance to rise again like the sun.
00:26:53.650,00:26:55.440,皇上革了三阿哥的黄带子,00:26:54.750,00:26:56.804,His Majesty stripped the Third Prince of his Imperial Belt
00:26:56.360,00:26:57.820,赶去做八爷的儿子了,00:26:57.460,00:26:59.033,and made him the son of Lord VIII!
00:26:58.900,00:27:00.240,你说什么呀,,,
00:27:00.530,00:27:02.020,已经交去宗人府办了,00:27:00.000,00:27:01.453,What are you talking about?
00:27:02.780,00:27:03.360,胡说,00:27:01.630,00:27:03.120,The Imperial Clan Court has received the decree.
00:27:05.040,00:27:06.780,三阿哥是皇上亲儿子,00:27:03.880,00:27:04.837,Nonsense!
00:27:07.290,00:27:07.950,怎么可能,00:27:06.140,00:27:07.993,The Third Prince is His Majesty's son.
00:27:09.370,00:27:10.610,奴婢哪敢胡言哪,00:27:08.390,00:27:09.767,How is this possible?
00:27:10.960,00:27:12.490,三阿哥替十四爷 八爷,00:27:10.470,00:27:11.840,I wouldn't dare lie to Your Majesty.
00:27:12.840,00:27:13.620,还有娘娘求情,00:27:12.060,00:27:14.492,"The Third Prince spoke up for Lord XIV, Lord VIII, and Your Majesty."
00:27:13.960,00:27:15.870,皇上斥责他心怀不轨,00:27:15.060,00:27:16.970,His Majesty accused him of having ulterior motives.
00:27:18.380,00:27:19.290,好端端的,,,
00:27:20.380,00:27:23.250,他帮那些罪臣求情做什么呀,00:27:19.480,00:27:24.320,Why all of a sudden ... did he speak up for those traitors?
00:27:25.060,00:27:28.220,本宫这么多年的心血全白费了,00:27:26.160,00:27:29.320,All my years of painstaking efforts ... completely wasted...
00:27:29.020,00:27:30.180,都白费了,00:27:30.120,00:27:31.280,Completely wasted!
00:27:30.560,00:27:32.640,娘娘 您快想想办法救救三阿哥,00:27:31.660,00:27:33.740,"Your Majesty, please think of a way to save the Third Prince!"
00:27:32.860,00:27:33.590,不中用,00:27:33.960,00:27:35.106,It's no use!
00:27:35.980,00:27:37.350,皇上素来狠心,00:27:37.080,00:27:38.827,His Majesty has always been hard-hearted.
00:27:38.280,00:27:42.190,如此就断了父子之情了,00:27:39.380,00:27:43.290,He has cut off his paternal love by doing so....
00:27:46.660,00:27:47.370,娘娘,00:27:47.760,00:27:48.734,"Your Majesty,"
00:27:48.750,00:27:50.160,若是三阿哥当不了皇太,00:27:49.850,00:27:51.560,if the Third Prince can't be the Crown...
00:27:50.460,00:27:52.950,没了三阿哥 还有四阿哥,00:27:51.560,00:27:52.989,"Without the Third Prince,"
00:27:53.290,00:27:54.120,还有五阿哥,00:27:52.989,00:27:55.200,there is still the Fourth Prince and Fifth Prince.
00:27:54.630,00:27:56.910,最不济还有六阿哥,00:27:55.730,00:27:58.010,"At the worst, there is the Sixth Prince."
00:27:58.090,00:28:01.210,就好像齐妃死了那样,00:27:58.954,00:28:00.134,The Sixth Prince...
,,,00:28:00.134,00:28:02.310,Just like how Consort Austuce died.
00:28:01.880,00:28:02.840,没了甄环,00:28:02.980,00:28:04.129,"Without Zhen Huan,"
00:28:03.890,00:28:05.840,本宫就可以抚养六阿哥,00:28:04.990,00:28:06.940,I can adopt the Sixth Prince.
00:28:07.560,00:28:09.760,都不要紧 都不要紧,00:28:08.660,00:28:10.860,Nothing else matters. Nothing!
00:28:10.930,00:28:13.220,只要本宫还是皇后,00:28:12.030,00:28:14.320,"As long as I am the Empress,"
00:28:14.100,00:28:17.350,只要本宫还可以东山再起,00:28:15.200,00:28:18.450,I can rise again like the sun behind the mountains!
00:28:18.530,00:28:20.110,谁的孩子都不重要,00:28:19.630,00:28:21.210,It doesn't matter who gave birth!
00:28:21.570,00:28:23.030,只要是本宫的孩子,00:28:22.670,00:28:24.356,"As long as the child becomes mine,"
00:28:24.450,00:28:27.570,本宫还是唯一的皇太后,00:28:25.550,00:28:28.670,I will be the one and only Empress Dowager!
00:28:46.220,00:28:47.710,我要的东西你都准备好了吗,,,
00:28:48.010,00:28:49.220,东西都准备好了,00:28:47.320,00:28:48.810,Did you prepare what I asked for?
00:28:49.470,00:28:51.460,可这事皇后娘娘还不知道,00:28:49.110,00:28:50.320,I did prepare it.
00:28:51.810,00:28:52.970,要不要禀告一下,00:28:50.570,00:28:52.560,But Her Majesty isn't aware of this.
00:28:53.230,00:28:54.890,主子受辱就是奴才无能,00:28:52.910,00:28:54.330,Shouldn't we report to her?
00:28:56.520,00:28:57.810,我跟着娘娘这么多年,00:28:54.330,00:28:56.320,A suffering master indicates the servant's incompetence.
00:28:58.400,00:29:00.100,都没见过她受过这样的屈辱,00:28:57.620,00:28:59.400,"I've followed Her Majesty for so many years,"
,,,00:28:59.500,00:29:01.313,and she has never endured such indignity.
00:29:01.400,00:29:04.020,堂堂皇后被妃嫔陷害而禁足,00:29:02.500,00:29:05.120,A lofty Empress is confined by a concubine's set-up?
00:29:04.820,00:29:06.360,还害得娘娘没有了三阿哥,,,
00:29:06.620,00:29:07.400,这个指望,00:29:05.920,00:29:08.480,It even caused Her Majesty to lose the Third Prince.
00:29:07.950,00:29:09.240,天下没有这样的道理,00:29:09.050,00:29:10.660,There can't be such injustice under Heaven.
00:29:09.990,00:29:12.280,可这事太大一旦失手,00:29:11.090,00:29:13.380,"But this is too risky. Should we fail,"
00:29:12.500,00:29:13.990,你我的性命不保啊,00:29:13.600,00:29:15.090,our lives will be at stake.
00:29:15.420,00:29:16.750,我拼了命也不要紧,00:29:16.520,00:29:18.227,It doesn't matter even if I lose my life.
00:29:18.170,00:29:19.330,只要除了熹贵妃,00:29:19.270,00:29:20.996,"As long as I can get rid of Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:29:20.460,00:29:21.870,娘娘以后也就能安乐了,00:29:21.560,00:29:23.200,Her Majesty will be at peace from now on.
00:29:23.340,00:29:24.200,把东西给我,00:29:24.440,00:29:25.489,Give it to me.
00:29:42.030,00:29:42.730,十七弟,00:29:43.130,00:29:44.170,Seventeenth Brother.
00:29:44.150,00:29:46.640,皇阿玛生辰的祭礼已经办完了,00:29:45.250,00:29:47.740,The ceremony for Imperial Father's birth anniversary is complete.
00:29:48.410,00:29:52.280,朕想起昔日皇阿玛在时,,,
00:29:52.620,00:29:54.610,对朕和你的教导,00:29:49.510,00:29:55.680,"Whenever I remember our days with Imperial Father,"
00:29:56.080,00:29:57.620,总是心有戚戚,00:29:57.180,00:29:58.720,I feel deeply touched.
00:29:59.670,00:30:01.080,所以今日流泪,00:30:00.770,00:30:02.444,And so I shed tears today.
00:30:03.010,00:30:05.840,咱们一家人聚聚兄弟之情,00:30:04.110,00:30:06.940,"As a family, we are here to celebrate our brotherly bond."
00:30:08.590,00:30:09.710,臣弟谢皇兄关爱,,,
00:30:10.140,00:30:11.000,先敬皇兄一杯,00:30:09.690,00:30:11.074,I thank Your Majesty for your care.

,,,00:30:12.320,00:30:14.190,"Sit down, sit down."
00:30:14.640,00:30:16.130,一家人不必拘礼,00:30:15.740,00:30:17.607,We're one family. Don't stand on ceremony.
00:30:17.890,00:30:18.970,皇阿玛若在,00:30:18.990,00:30:20.480,If Imperial Father was here
00:30:21.440,00:30:22.680,看到你成了家,,,
00:30:23.280,00:30:24.610,这么快就有了孩子,00:30:22.540,00:30:25.680,"and saw you having a child on the way now,"
00:30:25.990,00:30:27.150,一定很欣慰,00:30:27.090,00:30:28.640,he'd be delighted.
00:30:29.240,00:30:31.650,臣弟所有都是皇兄的恩典,00:30:30.340,00:30:32.901,Everything I have is by the grace of Your Majesty.
00:30:35.500,00:30:39.360,朕不忘先帝养育教导之恩,00:30:36.600,00:30:40.460,I always feel grateful for the prior emperor's edification.
00:30:41.080,00:30:44.420,你不忘敬侍兄长,00:30:42.180,00:30:45.520,And you always show respect to your elder brother
00:30:45.590,00:30:47.000,安分为臣之礼,00:30:46.690,00:30:48.480,while performing duties as a court official.

00:40:09.740,00:40:11.900,剪秋姑姑毒害熹贵妃不成,00:40:09.460,00:40:13.000,"I only heard Madam Autumn did not succeed
in poisoning Noble Consort Lumière"
00:40:12.610,00:40:13.820,害死了娴福晋,00:40:13.710,00:40:15.360,and killed Lord Consort Xian instead.
00:40:17.830,00:40:19.030,姑娘受了鞭刑,,,
00:40:19.330,00:40:20.440,还不肯说实话吗,00:40:18.930,00:40:21.540,Are you still unwilling to tell the truth despite the whipping?
00:40:23.040,00:40:24.580,皇后娘娘没做过的事,00:40:24.140,00:40:25.831,What is there to confess?
00:40:25.920,00:40:27.000,我有什么可招的,,,
00:40:28.050,00:40:29.630,你以为你们屈打成招,00:40:27.020,00:40:28.628,Her Majesty didn't do anything.
00:40:30.470,00:40:31.420,皇上就会信吗,00:40:29.150,00:40:32.935,"Do you really think His Majesty will believe you
if your tortures force a confession out of me?"
00:40:32.840,00:40:33.880,若是有他日,,,
00:40:35.180,00:40:36.710,皇后娘娘定不会饶了你们,00:40:33.940,00:40:39.110,Her Majesty will not spare you idiots once she regains power.
00:40:37.060,00:40:38.010,这帮蠢货,,,
00:40:39.020,00:40:40.680,咱们是奉了皇上的旨意,,,
00:40:41.390,00:40:42.600,不惜一切手段,00:40:40.120,00:40:42.120,We received His Majesty's decree.
00:40:43.190,00:40:44.390,只要问出实话来,00:40:42.490,00:40:45.490,We won't spare any means to get the truth out of you.
00:40:45.940,00:40:48.060,即便你们的身子是铁打的,00:40:47.040,00:40:49.160,"Even if your body is made of steel,"
00:40:49.480,00:40:51.520,怕也熬不过这流水的刑具,00:40:50.580,00:40:53.224,I doubt you can withstand unrelenting instruments of torture.
00:40:52.650,00:40:53.610,既然不肯说,,,
00:40:54.030,00:40:55.940,来人 上针刑,00:40:53.750,00:40:54.974,"Since you wouldn't tell us,"
00:40:56.280,00:40:56.860,你敢,00:40:55.130,00:40:57.040,bring on the needle punishment!
00:40:57.120,00:40:58.980,敢不敢不是问咱们,00:40:57.380,00:40:58.220,How dare you!
00:41:00.120,00:41:01.450,是要问这根针,00:40:58.220,00:41:00.080,Dare is not a question for us.
00:41:02.460,00:41:06.660,敢不敢钻姑娘的纤纤玉指啊,00:41:01.220,00:41:07.760,You need to ask if this needle dares to drill into your slim fingers.
00:41:07.960,00:41:10.290,剪秋的嘴最硬 便是她先来,00:41:09.060,00:41:11.390,Autumn is the most tight-lipped. She'll go first.
00:41:11.050,00:41:13.250,放开我 你放开我,00:41:11.880,00:41:13.880,Let go of me! Let go of me!
00:41:19.890,00:41:21.000,叫你不说,00:41:20.990,00:41:22.477,That's what you get for not telling.
00:41:22.430,00:41:23.140,你呢,00:41:23.530,00:41:24.429,What about you?
00:41:24.940,00:41:27.020,招不招啊 说,00:41:26.040,00:41:28.120,You going to confess? Speak!
00:41:29.190,00:41:29.930,快说呀,00:41:30.290,00:41:31.256,Hurry up and speak.
00:41:31.110,00:41:33.940,也不知道这些奴才会不会招,00:41:32.210,00:41:35.040,I wonder if the servants will confess.
00:41:36.320,00:41:37.610,都说精奇嬷嬷,,,
00:41:38.070,00:41:39.780,比刑部的郎官还厉害,00:41:37.420,00:41:40.880,"I've heard the Brilliant Madams are even more capable
than the men in the Ministry of Justice."
00:41:41.660,00:41:44.900,可是剪秋一向对皇后娘娘,00:41:42.760,00:41:47.510,But Autumn has always been the most loyal to the Empress.
00:41:45.250,00:41:46.410,忠心耿耿的,,,
00:41:46.960,00:41:48.820,就怕她不肯招呢,00:41:47.796,00:41:49.769,I'm afraid she won't confess.
00:41:49.710,00:41:51.250,没有剪秋 还有江福海,00:41:50.810,00:41:52.614,"Even if she doesn't, there is still Jiang Fuhai."
00:41:52.050,00:41:52.960,没有江福海,00:41:53.150,00:41:54.400,"And besides Jiang Fuhai,"
00:41:54.010,00:41:55.920,还有在慎刑司服役的绘春,00:41:55.110,00:41:57.246, Spring is also serving her time at the Department of Penalty.
00:41:56.760,00:41:58.000,一个一个审下去,,,
00:41:58.260,00:41:59.380,一定会有人吐口,00:41:57.860,00:41:59.360,"Having them interrogated one after the other,"
00:42:00.510,00:42:02.050,一旦撕开了一点口子,00:41:59.360,00:42:00.820,someone will eventually open up.
,,,00:42:01.610,00:42:03.339,"And once torn open,"
00:42:02.970,00:42:04.970,那下面的就瞒不住了,00:42:03.881,00:42:06.070,everything they've hidden inside will be revealed.
00:42:05.770,00:42:08.850,听你这么一说 我便放心了,00:42:06.870,00:42:09.950,My mind is finally at ease after hearing that.
00:42:10.650,00:42:12.260,事情已经闹得这么大了,00:42:11.750,00:42:13.737,This will become even more chaotic.
00:42:12.980,00:42:15.350,要是不往皇上的最痛处戳下去,00:42:14.080,00:42:16.450,His Majesty must be struck at his most vulnerable spot.
00:42:15.820,00:42:16.900,一旦皇后翻身,,,
00:42:17.860,00:42:19.070,那就不好收拾了,00:42:16.920,00:42:20.170,"Otherwise, if the Empress turns the tide around,
it won't be easy for us to reverse it."

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.100,00:43:00.100,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.100,00:43:20.100,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.100,00:43:37.100,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.100,00:43:55.100,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.100,00:44:15.100,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.100,00:44:34.100,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
