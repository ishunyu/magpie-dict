00:02:43.870,00:02:44.530,王爷,,,
00:02:44.990,00:02:46.230,阿晋昨天惹你生气了,00:02:44.880,00:02:45.880,Your Lordship.
,,,00:02:46.000,00:02:47.400,Did Ajin upset you yesterday?
00:02:48.080,00:02:49.410,阿晋说话一向爽快,00:02:49.180,00:02:50.480,"No, Ajin has always been plain-spoken."
00:02:50.170,00:02:52.250,他若说了什么 我也不会生气,00:02:51.048,00:02:52.253,"Regardless of what he said,"
00:02:53.460,00:02:54.320,我为王爷高兴,00:02:52.253,00:02:53.299,I wouldn't be angry.
00:02:55.800,00:02:56.960,我就知道你会这么说,00:02:54.338,00:02:55.623,Your marriage is happy news.
00:02:59.010,00:03:00.290,沛国公家世显赫,00:02:56.678,00:02:58.240,I knew you would say that.
00:03:01.050,00:03:02.460,虽然手中早没了实权,00:02:59.840,00:03:01.520,Duke of State Pei has a prominent family.
00:03:02.840,00:03:03.670,但家教甚好,00:03:02.120,00:03:03.640,"Although he doesn't have real power,"
,,,00:03:03.680,00:03:04.800,he is a cultured man.
00:03:04.430,00:03:06.970,教出来的女儿必定风姿出众,00:03:05.530,00:03:08.240,The daughter he raised must be poised and gracious.
00:03:07.810,00:03:08.840,何况太后又喜欢,00:03:08.680,00:03:10.080,"Besides, the Empress Dowager also favors her."
00:03:10.310,00:03:11.270,静娴,00:03:11.320,00:03:12.320,Jingxian...
00:03:12.440,00:03:13.350,一听名字便知,,,
00:03:13.690,00:03:14.770,是温柔大方的好女子,00:03:13.360,00:03:15.840,Her name sounds kind and decorous.
00:03:15.650,00:03:16.600,先恭喜王爷了,00:03:16.560,00:03:17.600,I congratulate Your Lordship.
00:03:26.030,00:03:27.110,你是真心恭喜我吗,00:03:27.000,00:03:28.200,Do you really mean it?
00:03:29.620,00:03:30.330,当然,00:03:30.520,00:03:31.520,Of course.
00:03:36.250,00:03:36.870,我来帮你,00:03:37.136,00:03:38.120,Allow me to help you.
00:03:43.930,00:03:45.170,无论你是否心口如一,00:03:44.920,00:03:46.400,"Whether you truly mean it or not,"
00:03:46.140,00:03:46.920,我只想告诉你,,,
00:03:47.930,00:03:49.050,我并不喜欢孟静娴,00:03:47.120,00:03:48.240,I only want you to know...
00:03:49.810,00:03:50.920,即便她如何如何好,00:03:48.960,00:03:50.400,I have no interest in Meng Jingxian.
00:03:51.940,00:03:53.270,偏偏不是我所中意的,00:03:50.720,00:03:52.080,"No matter how good she is,"
00:03:54.060,00:03:55.430,太后十分中意孟小姐,00:03:52.880,00:03:54.681,she is not the person I care for.
,,,00:03:54.960,00:03:56.787,But the Empress Dowager is very fond of Miss Meng.
00:03:57.110,00:03:59.190,何况王爷也到了该成婚的年纪,00:03:58.120,00:04:00.080,"And Your Lordship has reached
a marriageable age."
00:03:59.440,00:04:00.180,太后不知道,00:04:00.360,00:04:01.400,"Her Majesty doesn't know,"
00:04:01.320,00:04:02.180,你不是不知道,00:04:02.200,00:04:03.400,but you do.
00:04:04.870,00:04:06.570,即便王爷不中意孟家小姐,00:04:05.880,00:04:07.720,"Even if Your Lordship doesn't like Miss Meng,"
00:04:07.530,00:04:08.520,太后也会为你挑选,,,
00:04:08.870,00:04:09.950,其他匹配的婚事,00:04:08.520,00:04:11.000,Her Majesty will select another suitable lady for you.
00:04:11.290,00:04:12.950,王爷还能拒绝以后的每一位吗,00:04:12.240,00:04:14.240,Will Your Lordship be able to reject them all?
00:04:14.250,00:04:15.410,何况王爷中意之人,00:04:15.128,00:04:16.880,"Also, the person Your Lordship is fond of"
00:04:16.540,00:04:17.580,未必对王爷有心,00:04:17.600,00:04:18.960,might not feel the same for you.
00:04:21.420,00:04:22.330,我不是皇上,00:04:22.400,00:04:23.520,I'm not His Majesty.
00:04:23.430,00:04:24.790,我的婚姻关朕不到国运,00:04:24.360,00:04:26.360,My marriage won't have any effect on the state's future.
00:04:25.550,00:04:26.880,太后也不会勉强我的,00:04:26.560,00:04:28.237,Her Majesty won't force me either.
00:04:28.720,00:04:30.180,至于我所在意的意中人,00:04:29.600,00:04:31.400,As to whether or not the person I like
00:04:31.140,00:04:32.720,是否与我有相同的心意,00:04:32.080,00:04:33.640,"feels the same about me,"
00:04:34.140,00:04:34.880,我只相信,00:04:34.960,00:04:36.080,I only believe that...
00:04:35.730,00:04:38.270,精诚所至 金石为开,00:04:36.640,00:04:39.280,"""with dedicated effort,
even a rock will break open."""
00:04:40.280,00:04:41.440,精诚所至,,,
00:04:41.740,00:04:43.320,或许是有金石为开那一天,00:04:41.158,00:04:44.413,"With dedicated effort, perhaps the rock
will break open one day."
00:04:46.280,00:04:47.690,只是妾心若如古井,00:04:47.160,00:04:48.800,But my heart is like still water
00:04:48.780,00:04:49.690,不愿再起波澜,00:04:49.720,00:04:50.920,that doesn't want to ripple again.
00:04:51.660,00:04:52.990,甘露寺不便男子往来,00:04:52.600,00:04:54.039,"It is inappropriate for men to frequent
the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:04:53.460,00:04:54.570,我也不欲沾惹闲话,00:04:54.360,00:04:56.120,And I don't want to be the subject of gossip.
00:04:55.250,00:04:57.360,此后与王爷还是少见为好,00:04:56.160,00:04:58.238,"Your Lordship, we should meet
only when necessary."
00:04:57.750,00:04:58.710,你觉得我冒犯了你,00:04:58.640,00:04:59.734,Did I offend you?
00:04:59.880,00:05:00.710,不是冒犯,00:05:00.766,00:05:01.810,"No, you didn't."
00:05:02.010,00:05:02.990,是云泥之别,00:05:02.888,00:05:04.400,But we're as far apart as clouds and mud.
00:05:04.930,00:05:06.010,王爷天演贵胃,00:05:05.840,00:05:07.678,Your Lordship is a descendent of the imperial family.
00:05:06.800,00:05:08.010,实在不宜多来此地,00:05:07.678,00:05:09.218,You shouldn't come here so often.
00:05:10.060,00:05:10.890,你不愿意见我,00:05:10.903,00:05:11.990,You don't want to see me?
00:05:11.430,00:05:12.890,不该相见自然不愿见,00:05:12.320,00:05:14.480,"I don't, because we shouldn't be seeing each other."
00:05:14.350,00:05:15.810,还请王爷尊重我的意愿,00:05:15.228,00:05:16.910,I hope Your Lordship will respect my wishes.
00:05:21.480,00:05:22.270,既然这样,00:05:22.358,00:05:23.447,If you wish...
00:05:24.320,00:05:24.930,好吧,00:05:25.198,00:05:26.160,so be it.
00:05:38.460,00:05:39.200,这入冬以来,00:05:39.200,00:05:40.480,"Ever since winter arrived,"
00:05:41.340,00:05:42.920,娘子便一直咳喘不息,00:05:42.440,00:05:44.080,"Mistress, you have been coughing nonstop."
00:05:43.630,00:05:45.090,整夜整夜地睡不好,,,
00:05:45.260,00:05:46.090,又盗汗,00:05:44.508,00:05:46.880,"You can't sleep well at night
and are having night sweats."
00:05:46.840,00:05:48.050,这可怎么是好呢,00:05:47.726,00:05:49.320,What can we do?
00:05:57.890,00:05:58.720,怎样啊,00:05:58.990,00:05:59.960,How was it?
00:06:01.570,00:06:02.480,我去了温府,,,
00:06:03.020,00:06:03.850,府里的人说,00:06:02.448,00:06:03.708,"I went to Dr. Wen's residence,"
00:06:04.480,00:06:06.480,入冬后太后就旧病复发了,00:06:03.898,00:06:07.379,"but they said the Empress Dowager has been ill
since the beginning of winter."
00:06:06.900,00:06:07.980,留了温大人伺候,,,
00:06:08.490,00:06:09.350,不让他出宫,00:06:07.840,00:06:09.400,"Dr. Wen stays in the palace to care for
Her Majesty"
,,,00:06:09.440,00:06:10.534,and is not allowed to leave.
00:06:10.530,00:06:12.990,对太后凤体要紧,00:06:12.600,00:06:14.320,Her Majesty's health takes priority.
00:06:13.950,00:06:16.360,温大人费心也是情理之中的事,00:06:14.828,00:06:17.520,"It is only reasonable that Dr. Wen
puts forth his best effort."
00:06:17.410,00:06:18.620,也只有太后安好,00:06:18.244,00:06:19.840,"Only when Her Majesty is well,"
00:06:19.370,00:06:21.870,才会让芳若来庇护咱们,00:06:20.200,00:06:22.920,will she have Madam Orchid come to look after us.
00:06:23.500,00:06:25.590,冰糖雪梨吃了多少都不见好,00:06:24.520,00:06:26.680,"The snow pear simmered with
rock sugar hasn't helped at all."
00:06:26.050,00:06:28.250,好在王爷让阿晋送了一些燕窝来,00:06:26.840,00:06:29.436,"Fortunately, His Lordship sent Ajin
to bring you some bird's nest."
00:06:28.680,00:06:30.010,最能生津润肺的,00:06:29.600,00:06:31.120,It is best for nourishing the lungs.
00:06:30.510,00:06:32.800,娘子要不吃完再写吧,00:06:31.610,00:06:32.600,"Mistress,"
00:06:33.560,00:06:34.760,我写完再吃吧,00:06:32.600,00:06:34.040,how about having this now?
00:06:36.350,00:06:37.680,哪有这么娇气了,00:06:34.660,00:06:36.245,I'll finish copying before I eat.
00:06:38.230,00:06:39.970,不过是咳了两声而已,00:06:37.400,00:06:38.951,I'm not that fragile.
00:06:40.770,00:06:42.310,哪里是咳两声的事情啊,00:06:39.160,00:06:41.000,It's only a couple of coughs.
00:06:42.810,00:06:43.850,人都要咳坏了,00:06:41.571,00:06:43.360,It's not just a couple of coughs.
00:06:44.320,00:06:46.270,饶是这样静白还打发小姐,00:06:43.840,00:06:45.160,You are wracked by coughing.
00:06:46.610,00:06:47.820,去溪边洗那么多的衣裳,00:06:45.320,00:06:48.920,"Even so, Jingbai still ordered My Lady
to wash all the clothes by the stream."
00:06:48.320,00:06:50.310,我看小姐就是过分劳累了,00:06:49.200,00:06:51.240,You must have exhausted yourself from all the work.
00:06:51.240,00:06:52.820,姑娘还是少说两句吧,00:06:52.074,00:06:53.640,"Jade, please refrain yourself."
00:06:53.370,00:06:54.780,为了娘子咳嗽得厉害,,,
00:06:55.200,00:06:56.530,外边不知道有多少闲话,00:06:54.280,00:06:58.320,"Mistress's cough has already stirred up
a lot of rumors."
00:06:56.870,00:06:57.660,说得难听呢,,,
00:06:58.250,00:07:01.030,竟还有说娘子得了肺痨的,00:06:59.295,00:07:00.520,Some even harshly accused her
00:07:01.500,00:07:02.280,谁这样胡说啊,00:07:00.640,00:07:01.920,of catching tuberculosis.
00:07:02.920,00:07:03.450,我看小姐,00:07:02.600,00:07:03.679,Who said such nonsense?
00:07:03.840,00:07:05.170,就是这样被她们折磨坏的,00:07:03.960,00:07:06.303,"It's their ill treatment that has
 worsened My Lady's health!"
00:07:09.340,00:07:11.380,咱们甘露寺不能住得了肺痨的人,00:07:10.218,00:07:12.640,"We can't have someone with tuberculosis
living in the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:07:11.890,00:07:12.340,就是,,,
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.840,那还有别的香客敢来住吗,00:07:12.920,00:07:15.072,"- That's right.
- Who would dare come offer incense now?"
00:07:15.390,00:07:16.750,这百年古刹的名声,,,
00:07:17.390,00:07:17.970,可不能断送在,00:07:16.490,00:07:17.920,The ancient temple's reputation
00:07:18.310,00:07:19.470,一个不祥之人的手里,00:07:18.320,00:07:20.501,must not be ruined by a person of ill omen.
00:07:20.310,00:07:21.890,哪个人说我们小姐得了肺痨,00:07:21.240,00:07:23.200,Who said My Lady caught tuberculosis?
00:07:22.900,00:07:23.850,哪个大夫说过了,,,
00:07:24.560,00:07:25.390,你这样满口胡说,00:07:23.880,00:07:25.120,Which doctor confirmed it?
00:07:25.860,00:07:27.060,你也不怕天打雷劈吗,00:07:25.440,00:07:26.760,Spreading such nonsense...
00:07:27.280,00:07:27.890,你,00:07:26.800,00:07:28.200,Aren't you afraid of being struck by lightning?
00:07:29.110,00:07:30.230,就算不是肺痨,00:07:28.440,00:07:29.440,You...
00:07:30.780,00:07:31.810,也和肺痨差不离了,00:07:30.210,00:07:31.515,"Even if it's not tuberculosis,"
00:07:32.110,00:07:32.940,是就是啊,00:07:31.515,00:07:33.040,it's not far from it.
00:07:33.450,00:07:34.360,这样日咳夜咳的,00:07:33.040,00:07:34.080,"- Right.
- Yes, that's right."
00:07:34.700,00:07:35.810,咳得旁人还要不要住了,00:07:34.080,00:07:35.200,She is coughing day and night.
,,,00:07:35.200,00:07:36.960,How can we live here with her?
00:07:36.120,00:07:37.980,对呀就是我们还住不住了,00:07:37.120,00:07:38.960,"- Indeed.
- Who would want to live here?"
00:07:38.330,00:07:39.160,看着都晦气,00:07:39.000,00:07:40.400,Even looking at her brings bad luck.
00:07:40.410,00:07:41.320,是我不好,00:07:41.253,00:07:42.240,It's my fault.
00:07:42.420,00:07:44.910,我身子不好连累大家了,00:07:43.520,00:07:45.800,My ill health has been a burden to everyone.
00:07:45.170,00:07:47.120,知道牵累了旁人就应该赶紧走,00:07:46.080,00:07:48.280,"If you know you are a burden,
you should leave immediately."
00:07:47.340,00:07:47.830,对呀,,,
00:07:48.130,00:07:49.960,这样死赖活赖着招人讨厌,00:07:48.786,00:07:51.000,You're becoming a nuisance by refusing to leave.
00:07:50.340,00:07:52.250,是可不是吗就是,00:07:51.440,00:07:53.480,"- Exactly.
 - True, true."
00:07:53.680,00:07:55.710,你们瞧她就是个贼,00:07:54.600,00:07:55.600,Look!
,,,00:07:55.920,00:07:57.000,She's a thief!
00:07:56.510,00:07:58.300,这现成的贼赃就在这里呢,00:07:57.480,00:07:59.360,The spoils are right here.
00:07:59.140,00:07:59.850,什么,00:08:00.240,00:08:01.240,What?
00:08:01.060,00:08:02.340,说话要有凭据,00:08:02.160,00:08:03.560,You can't make groundless accusations.
00:08:03.600,00:08:05.810,我我何曾偷你们东西了,00:08:04.700,00:08:06.600,When did I ever steal from you?
00:08:06.560,00:08:09.270,甘露寺里只有我和住持才吃燕窝,00:08:07.600,00:08:10.160,"Only Madam Abbess and I consume
bird's nest in the temple."
00:08:09.820,00:08:11.400,你这燕窝是从哪儿来的,00:08:10.920,00:08:12.440,Where did you get the bird's nest?
00:08:11.700,00:08:13.310,就是的从哪儿来的呀,00:08:12.600,00:08:14.320,"- Exactly.
- Where did you get it from?"
00:08:15.070,00:08:16.810,那太医总有好些日子,,,
00:08:17.200,00:08:17.990,没来看你了吧,00:08:16.080,00:08:19.000,That doctor hasn't come to visit you in a while.
00:08:18.620,00:08:21.660,你可别说这燕窝是他拿给你的,00:08:19.720,00:08:22.480,"Don't tell me he was the one
who gave you the bird's nest."
00:08:23.330,00:08:24.410,宫里头的姑姑,,,
00:08:24.670,00:08:26.000,也有两三个月没来了,00:08:24.280,00:08:26.880,"The Madam from the palace hasn't
visited in months either."
00:08:26.750,00:08:28.710,你若不是偷我和主持的,00:08:27.960,00:08:29.680,"If you didn't steal from me or Madam Abbess,"
00:08:29.380,00:08:31.240,难不成这燕窝,,,
00:08:31.590,00:08:33.380,还自己长腿跑到你碗里的吗,00:08:30.320,00:08:34.320,did the bird's nest just grow out of your bowl?
00:08:33.760,00:08:35.210,就是啊这到底从哪儿来的,00:08:34.360,00:08:36.120,"- Exactly.
- Where did this come from?"
00:08:35.590,00:08:36.500,她每天拾了柴火回来,,,
00:08:36.930,00:08:38.290,都要到师父房里去说一声,00:08:36.200,00:08:39.310,"She reports to Prioress Jingbai every day
after she is done collecting firewood."
00:08:38.720,00:08:39.800,一定是她偷了燕窝吃的,00:08:39.606,00:08:40.840,She must have stolen it then.
00:08:40.350,00:08:41.430,就是我看就是她,00:08:41.145,00:08:42.320,"- I agree.
- It must be her."
00:08:41.770,00:08:43.470,既然燕窝是日日吃的东西,00:08:42.560,00:08:44.480,Since you eat bird's nest often -
00:08:44.640,00:08:45.510,若是不见了,00:08:45.560,00:08:46.560,"if it was stolen,"
00:08:46.600,00:08:48.060,你早该发现去找了,00:08:47.480,00:08:49.000,you would have noticed it earlier.
00:08:48.900,00:08:50.560,怎么眼瞧着到了我这儿,00:08:50.000,00:08:51.400,Why would you wait until now
00:08:50.940,00:08:52.520,才说起有贼这回事呢,00:08:51.760,00:08:53.480,to bring this up?
00:08:52.690,00:08:53.810,没那么多废话和你说,00:08:53.520,00:08:54.840,I don't have time to waste my breath on you.
00:08:54.610,00:08:55.520,你若有本事,00:08:55.532,00:08:56.640,"If you can,"
00:08:56.070,00:08:58.150,只说这碗燕窝是从哪里来的就是,00:08:57.000,00:08:59.120,simply explain where you obtained the bird's nest.
00:08:59.030,00:09:01.900,若说不出来就是偷了我的,00:09:00.080,00:09:01.160,"If you can't,"
00:09:02.160,00:09:02.820,对就是,00:09:02.080,00:09:03.200,then you must have stolen it from me.
00:09:03.160,00:09:04.200,怎么就许你们有燕窝,00:09:03.240,00:09:04.240,"- Exactly!
- She's right!"
00:09:04.750,00:09:05.860,旁人就不许有燕窝了,00:09:04.400,00:09:05.480,"You can have the bird's nest,"
00:09:06.330,00:09:07.040,旁人,00:09:05.560,00:09:06.800,"why can't others have it, too?"
00:09:08.330,00:09:10.250,旁人或许还有家里人,00:09:07.360,00:09:08.360,Others?
00:09:10.550,00:09:11.410,会送些东西来,00:09:09.480,00:09:12.280,Others may have family who will send them things.
00:09:12.090,00:09:12.870,可莫愁,,,
00:09:13.130,00:09:14.670,是宫里头赶出来的不祥之人,00:09:13.120,00:09:15.600,But Mochou was expelled from the palace.
00:09:15.180,00:09:16.630,她怎么会有这么贵重的燕窝,00:09:16.160,00:09:17.610,How could she have such valuable bird's nest?
00:09:16.970,00:09:17.670,就是的,00:09:17.680,00:09:18.680,Exactly.
00:09:18.140,00:09:20.340,贼就是贼 抵赖也不中用,00:09:19.080,00:09:20.120,A thief is a thief.
,,,00:09:20.320,00:09:21.320,You can't deny it.
00:09:21.930,00:09:22.760,我去请住持,00:09:22.760,00:09:23.760,I'll go get Madam Abbess.
00:09:25.390,00:09:26.470,怎么了怎么了,00:09:26.440,00:09:27.570,What happened? What happened?
00:09:27.230,00:09:28.680,都这么吵吵闹闹的,00:09:28.280,00:09:29.780,What's with all the commotion?
00:09:29.690,00:09:31.770,莫愁是个贼偷了燕窝,00:09:30.680,00:09:31.720,"Mochou is a thief,"
00:09:32.280,00:09:33.360,现下又得了肺痨,00:09:31.720,00:09:32.720,who stole my bird's nest.
00:09:33.740,00:09:35.270,这甘露寺是住不得了,00:09:33.080,00:09:34.360,She also has tuberculosis.
00:09:35.780,00:09:36.480,就是,00:09:34.560,00:09:36.400,so she can't live here anymore.
00:09:37.070,00:09:38.030,行了行了,00:09:36.800,00:09:37.800,Indeed.
,,,00:09:38.040,00:09:39.200,That's enough.
00:09:38.570,00:09:40.780,你们怎么给她零碎折磨受的,00:09:39.320,00:09:41.680,I have been aware for quite a while of
00:09:41.120,00:09:42.320,我早就看在眼里了,00:09:41.800,00:09:43.320,the torture you all inflicted upon her.
00:09:42.910,00:09:44.450,真就这么容不得她吗,00:09:43.880,00:09:45.600,You really can't tolerate her?
00:09:46.160,00:09:47.400,不是咱们容不得她,00:09:47.160,00:09:48.520,It's not that we can't tolerate her.
00:09:48.210,00:09:49.620,她是从宫里头出来的,00:09:49.120,00:09:50.720,But she was expelled from the palace.
00:09:50.170,00:09:52.280,宫里头的态度你也是清楚的,00:09:51.120,00:09:53.160,"I'm sure you know the sentiments
of those in the palace."
00:09:53.050,00:09:54.630,咱们若是再容她,00:09:54.040,00:09:55.760,"If we continue to allow her to live here,"
00:09:55.300,00:09:56.210,那总有一天,00:09:56.080,00:09:57.080,"sooner or later,"
00:09:56.630,00:09:58.210,倒霉的是咱们甘露寺啊,,,
00:09:58.590,00:09:59.550,就是对呀,00:09:57.560,00:09:59.400,she will bring trouble to the temple.
00:09:59.760,00:10:00.590,行了行了,00:09:59.480,00:10:00.480,"- It's true.
- Yes."
,,,00:10:00.560,00:10:01.600,That's enough.
00:10:01.470,00:10:03.300,莫愁也是怪可怜的,00:10:02.520,00:10:04.400,Mochou is rather pitiful.
00:10:03.640,00:10:05.050,住持若是怜悯莫愁,00:10:04.600,00:10:06.160,"Madam Abbess, if you show
compassion for Mochou now,"
00:10:05.850,00:10:08.140,那可怜的就该是咱们了,00:10:06.760,00:10:09.280,we will be the pitiful ones later.
00:10:08.480,00:10:09.560,可不是嘛,00:10:09.360,00:10:10.360,"- She's right.
- Exactly."
00:10:12.520,00:10:13.890,怎么病成这样啊,00:10:13.560,00:10:15.040,How did you become so sick?
00:10:14.780,00:10:15.810,那,00:10:15.680,00:10:16.680,Then...
00:10:16.530,00:10:18.640,那方才说肺痨是怎么回事啊,00:10:17.520,00:10:19.600,then what about the claim of tuberculosis?
00:10:20.160,00:10:22.240,没有大夫来看过说是肺痨,00:10:21.160,00:10:23.080,"No doctor has seen me and
confirmed it's tuberculosis."
00:10:22.870,00:10:24.360,我只是咳得厉害,00:10:23.748,00:10:25.238,I just have a severe cough.
00:10:24.830,00:10:25.570,吃药了吗,00:10:25.600,00:10:26.800,Have you been taking medicine?
00:10:26.450,00:10:27.860,已经按照药方抓过了,00:10:27.372,00:10:28.640,"Yes, she has."
00:10:28.330,00:10:30.320,只是还不曾见效呢,00:10:29.164,00:10:31.360,But it hasn't taken effect yet.
00:10:31.750,00:10:33.910,莫愁这样日夜咳着有大半个月了,00:10:32.640,00:10:34.800,"Mochou has been coughing like this
for more than half a month."
00:10:34.420,00:10:35.790,其实早两个月就在咳,,,
00:10:36.130,00:10:37.000,只是没那么厉害,00:10:35.400,00:10:37.000,"She actually started coughing two months ago,"
00:10:37.470,00:10:38.120,若不是肺痨,00:10:37.000,00:10:38.080,but it wasn't as severe.
00:10:38.470,00:10:39.920,怎么吃了这么久的药都不见好啊,00:10:38.360,00:10:39.360,"If it's not tuberculosis,"
00:10:40.090,00:10:40.750,没错,00:10:39.360,00:10:41.040,why hasn't the medicine shown effects yet?
00:10:41.470,00:10:42.300,你瞧她这样瘦,00:10:41.080,00:10:42.080,"- Exactly.
- That's right."
00:10:42.680,00:10:43.960,一咳起来脸都红成这样了,00:10:42.392,00:10:43.400,Look how skinny she is.
00:10:44.310,00:10:45.420,多半是治不好的肺痨,00:10:43.440,00:10:44.960,Her face flushes when coughing.
00:10:45.810,00:10:47.170,咱们断断不能和她住在一块了,00:10:45.120,00:10:46.440,She probably has deadly tuberculosis.
00:10:47.600,00:10:48.340,就是不能跟她住一块,00:10:46.640,00:10:48.120,We can't live with her any longer.
00:10:48.640,00:10:49.550,可不是吗,00:10:48.400,00:10:50.000,"- Right.
- We surely can't."
00:10:50.060,00:10:50.890,莫愁啊,00:10:51.080,00:10:52.080,"Mochou,"
00:10:51.560,00:10:53.800,眼下你的身子这么不好,00:10:52.560,00:10:54.720,"Since you are in ill health,"
00:10:54.480,00:10:57.520,她们又怎么都不肯跟你共处,00:10:55.440,00:10:58.560,and they're not willing to live with you.
00:10:58.150,00:11:00.270,不如先搬出去吧,00:10:59.250,00:11:01.440,What about... moving out for now?
00:11:02.530,00:11:03.320,住持,00:11:03.560,00:11:04.560,Madam Abbess...
00:11:04.330,00:11:05.310,您知道的,00:11:05.320,00:11:06.320,You know...
00:11:05.950,00:11:07.740,我们眼下无亲无故,00:11:07.000,00:11:08.800,that we have no one to depend on.
00:11:08.960,00:11:10.490,我们能搬去哪儿呢,00:11:10.000,00:11:11.590,Where can we move to?
00:11:11.920,00:11:13.500,身为住持不能主持公道,00:11:12.920,00:11:14.680,"As Abbess, you should administer justice,"
00:11:14.040,00:11:15.700,只能听着一群姑子瞎嚷嚷,00:11:14.680,00:11:16.800,"but have been swayed by a
group of nuns shouting nonsense."
00:11:16.130,00:11:17.290,耳根子未免太软了吧,00:11:17.000,00:11:18.212,How spineless you are!
00:11:17.760,00:11:18.370,闭嘴,00:11:18.640,00:11:19.640,Shut your mouth!
00:11:19.670,00:11:21.010,住持也是你能指责的吗,00:11:20.640,00:11:22.040,How dare you criticize the abbess!
00:11:22.510,00:11:23.420,说就是了,00:11:23.520,00:11:24.560,You can reply with words.
00:11:23.890,00:11:25.420,你仗势欺人算什么呀,00:11:24.680,00:11:26.360,Why do you have to hit her?
00:11:28.390,00:11:31.220,住持可否听我一句话,00:11:29.440,00:11:30.440,"Madam Abbess,"
00:11:31.980,00:11:33.470,我们娘子是不是肺痨,00:11:30.720,00:11:32.280,Can I offer an opinion?
00:11:33.810,00:11:34.680,现在还不可而知,00:11:33.080,00:11:35.591,We don't know if our mistress has tuberculosis yet.
00:11:35.150,00:11:36.680,可是她现如今身子这么弱,,,
00:11:36.980,00:11:37.690,病得这么厉害,00:11:36.120,00:11:38.624,But she is very sick and fragile now.
00:11:37.980,00:11:39.190,外面又冰天雪地的,00:11:38.680,00:11:40.320,And it's frozen and snowy outside.
00:11:39.570,00:11:41.060,让我们一时间往哪儿搬呢,00:11:40.440,00:11:42.160,"Where can we move to
on the spur of the moment?"
00:11:41.650,00:11:43.110,住持我求求您,00:11:42.640,00:11:44.210,"Madam Abbess, I'm begging you,"
00:11:43.700,00:11:45.780,您多宽容我们几日可好,00:11:44.760,00:11:46.720,please give us a few days' grace.
00:11:46.530,00:11:47.520,这样病快快的,,,
00:11:47.790,00:11:48.820,怎么和咱们一块住啊,00:11:47.520,00:11:50.000,How can she live with us while being so sick?
00:11:49.330,00:11:49.990,就是,,,
00:11:50.330,00:11:51.320,这样日咳夜咳的,00:11:50.280,00:11:51.280,Exactly.
00:11:51.620,00:11:52.530,咱们还要不要睡了,00:11:51.280,00:11:53.400,How can we sleep when she coughs day and night?
00:11:52.830,00:11:54.290,是啊她就是个贼,00:11:53.800,00:11:55.390,"Yes, and she is a thief!"
00:11:54.790,00:11:55.700,她今日偷燕窝,,,
00:11:56.000,00:11:57.410,明日还不知道偷什么呢,00:11:55.680,00:11:56.680,"She stole the bird's nest today,"
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.040,若莫愁住在甘露寺,00:11:56.760,00:11:58.520,who knows what she will steal tomorrow?
00:11:59.340,00:12:00.120,我们就不住了,00:11:58.760,00:12:01.120,We will not live here if Mochou stays any longer.
00:12:00.340,00:12:01.200,是啊我们就不住了,,,
00:12:01.550,00:12:02.330,就是就是不住,00:12:01.280,00:12:03.000,"- Right! We won't live here.
- Exactly. We won't."
00:12:02.630,00:12:04.300,既然甘露寺容不下咱们,00:12:03.080,00:12:05.000,"Since the Temple of Pure Dew can't tolerate us,"
00:12:05.090,00:12:07.300,我也不叫住持为难了,00:12:06.012,00:12:08.222,I won't create a dilemma for Madame Abbess.
00:12:08.260,00:12:09.170,只是一样,00:12:09.280,00:12:10.280,"However,"
00:12:09.970,00:12:11.210,我并不是贼,00:12:11.070,00:12:12.200,I'm not a thief.
00:12:11.770,00:12:13.350,这燕窝不是我偷来的,00:12:12.692,00:12:14.272,I didn't steal the bird's nest.
00:12:16.730,00:12:18.640,既然甘露寺容不下咱们,00:12:17.600,00:12:19.640,"Since there is no place for us here,"
00:12:19.230,00:12:20.390,咱们走就是了,00:12:20.120,00:12:21.200,let's leave.
00:12:22.900,00:12:23.640,我,,,
00:12:23.910,00:12:24.940,快去收拾东西吧,00:12:23.800,00:12:24.760,I...
00:12:25.990,00:12:27.360,住持小姐,00:12:24.760,00:12:26.040,Go pack up our things.
00:12:27.830,00:12:28.610,既然是贼,00:12:27.000,00:12:28.080,Madam Abbess...
00:12:29.120,00:12:30.230,那这些带走的东西,00:12:28.760,00:12:29.760,You are thieves.
00:12:30.620,00:12:31.830,咱们都是要一一翻查过的,00:12:30.000,00:12:32.800,So we have to check the things you're taking with you.
00:12:32.000,00:12:32.530,你,,,
00:12:32.870,00:12:34.280,万一被你们夹带了什么出去,00:12:32.880,00:12:35.120,"- You...
- If you smuggle something out of here,"
00:12:34.710,00:12:35.990,那咱们可是说不清楚的,00:12:35.600,00:12:37.090,ownership will be your word against ours.
00:12:36.460,00:12:38.370,静白别说了,00:12:37.440,00:12:38.480,"Jingbai,"
,,,00:12:38.480,00:12:39.480,stop!
00:12:41.050,00:12:43.160,这种地方不住也罢,00:12:42.080,00:12:43.080,This place...
00:12:45.390,00:12:46.550,我帮你们收拾东西,00:12:43.400,00:12:44.560,holds no worth for you.
00:12:46.930,00:12:47.760,等一下送你们出去,00:12:46.400,00:12:47.650,I'll help you to pack up things
,,,00:12:47.720,00:12:48.860,and walk you out afterwards.
00:12:49.010,00:12:52.180,莫愁啊 凌云峰有几处禅房,00:12:49.960,00:12:50.960,"Mochou,"
,,,00:12:51.040,00:12:53.080,"there are some living quarters on Peak Lingyun,"
00:12:52.600,00:12:54.930,你先去住着不用修行了,00:12:53.520,00:12:56.080,You can stay there for now and take a rest from practicing.
00:12:55.270,00:12:57.600,一切等身子好了再说,00:12:56.160,00:12:58.800,Let's wait until you return to health.
00:12:59.400,00:13:00.480,多谢住持,00:13:00.400,00:13:01.580,"Thank you, Madam Abbess."
00:13:03.320,00:13:04.530,装腔作势,00:13:04.480,00:13:05.630,Look at her feigning.
00:13:05.780,00:13:08.190,谁要是再罗嗦 尽管找我说话,00:13:06.880,00:13:09.290,"Anyone who wants to complain can
talk to me directly!"
00:13:36.190,00:13:36.890,小姐,,,
00:13:37.350,00:13:38.560,小姐 小姐,00:13:37.120,00:13:38.120,My Lady!
00:13:39.020,00:13:39.850,娘子 小姐,00:13:38.320,00:13:39.320,My Lady!
00:13:40.650,00:13:41.810,娘子 小姐,00:13:39.920,00:13:41.000,"- Mistress!
- My Lady!"
,,,00:13:41.360,00:13:42.910,"- Mistress!
- My Lady!"
00:13:47.740,00:13:48.600,烧得厉害,,,
00:13:48.950,00:13:49.810,这可怎么是好啊,00:13:48.760,00:13:49.760,She's burning up!
00:13:51.700,00:13:52.740,雪下得这么大,00:13:49.760,00:13:50.920,What should we do?
00:13:53.160,00:13:54.740,去凌云峰的禅房也来不及了,00:13:52.840,00:13:53.880,"With such a heavy snow,"
00:13:55.080,00:13:55.910,甘露寺又去不了,00:13:54.120,00:13:55.840,we can't make it to Peak Lingyun anytime soon.
00:13:56.330,00:13:57.660,这前不着村后不着店的,00:13:55.920,00:13:57.010,And we can't go back to the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:13:58.370,00:13:59.490,怕也请不到大夫呀,00:13:57.200,00:13:58.800,"We're stranded in this deserted place,"
00:13:59.880,00:14:00.790,这可怎么是好,00:13:59.120,00:14:00.590,where no doctor can be found.
00:14:01.130,00:14:02.160,这是哪儿啊这是,00:14:00.760,00:14:01.890,What should we do?
,,,00:14:02.000,00:14:03.260,Where are we now?
00:14:06.300,00:14:07.910,倒也不是前不着村 后不着店,00:14:07.222,00:14:08.920,It's not completely deserted.
00:14:08.380,00:14:09.040,浣碧,,,
00:14:09.590,00:14:10.580,前面就是清凉台,00:14:09.360,00:14:10.360," Jade,"
,,,00:14:10.480,00:14:11.800,the Cooling Terrace is ahead!
00:14:12.180,00:14:13.470,只有找一个人去帮忙,00:14:13.160,00:14:14.600,There is only one person we can ask for help.
00:14:26.320,00:14:27.310,快去快回,00:14:27.242,00:14:28.280,Go quickly!
00:14:33.240,00:14:33.950,小姐,00:14:34.340,00:14:35.320,My Lady!
00:14:35.330,00:14:36.410,这可怎么是好,00:14:36.160,00:14:37.360,What should we do...
00:14:42.460,00:14:43.750,浣碧怎么去了那么久啊,00:14:43.480,00:14:44.850,What is taking Jade so long?
00:14:45.170,00:14:46.960,你们说的那个人到底会不会来,00:14:46.200,00:14:48.080,Will the person you mentioned come?
00:14:47.590,00:14:49.500,我也不知道只能赌一把,00:14:48.360,00:14:49.400,I am not sure.
00:14:50.640,00:14:51.750,若真的走投无路,00:14:49.480,00:14:50.422,We have to trust our luck.
00:14:52.100,00:14:53.010,娘子也不能获救,00:14:51.560,00:14:54.080,"Even if we have no place to turn to save the mistress,"
00:14:54.560,00:14:56.170,我们始终跟娘子在一起,00:14:55.480,00:14:57.345,we will still stay with her no matter what.
00:15:02.360,00:15:03.090,王爷,,,
00:15:04.110,00:15:04.810,王爷,00:15:03.460,00:15:04.440,Your Lordship!
00:15:06.360,00:15:07.060,王爷,00:15:05.160,00:15:06.160,Your Lordship!
00:15:10.030,00:15:10.980,怎么烧得这么烫,00:15:07.360,00:15:08.360,Your Lordship!
00:15:11.530,00:15:12.690,娘子身子本来就弱,00:15:11.080,00:15:12.160,She is burning up!
00:15:13.200,00:15:13.900,又着了风,00:15:12.480,00:15:14.040,Our mistress has always been frail.
00:15:14.330,00:15:15.280,怕是受了风寒,00:15:14.160,00:15:15.280,The weather aggravated her condition.
00:15:15.450,00:15:16.110,来,00:15:15.280,00:15:16.400,She must have caught a cold.
,,,00:15:16.400,00:15:17.400,Take this.
00:15:18.450,00:15:20.620,这里一入冬就容易大雪封山,00:15:19.550,00:15:22.000,"During winter, heavy snow often closes
the mountain pass here."
00:15:21.290,00:15:22.250,趁着雪还没有封路,,,
00:15:22.880,00:15:23.790,赶紧跟我回清凉台,00:15:22.240,00:15:23.520,"While the roads are still clear,"
00:15:24.540,00:15:25.280,谢王爷,00:15:23.800,00:15:25.126,let's hurry back to the Cooling Terrace.
00:15:25.630,00:15:27.290,凌云峰的禅房不能没人打点,00:15:25.480,00:15:26.480,I thank Your Lordship.
00:15:27.590,00:15:29.000,我先上凌云峰去打点禅房,00:15:26.520,00:15:28.280,"The living quarters on Peak Lingyun
need to be arranged first."
00:15:29.550,00:15:30.710,等娘子身子好一些,00:15:28.480,00:15:30.160,I will go there to prepare the rooms for now.
00:15:31.090,00:15:31.960,你们再把她送回来,00:15:30.480,00:15:32.920,"You can send our mistress back
when she gets better."
00:15:32.140,00:15:32.590,好,,,
00:15:33.510,00:15:34.090,多谢,00:15:32.960,00:15:33.960,Good.
00:15:34.510,00:15:36.000,你接过去的可是条命啊,00:15:34.480,00:15:35.480,Thank you.
00:15:36.260,00:15:36.840,我知道,00:15:35.480,00:15:37.040,You are responsible for her life now!
00:15:37.060,00:15:37.670,你不知道,00:15:37.040,00:15:38.040,I know.
00:15:38.430,00:15:39.220,你是个男人,00:15:38.040,00:15:39.258,"No, you don't."
00:15:39.810,00:15:41.300,男人都会让女人伤心的,00:15:39.400,00:15:40.542,You are a man.
,,,00:15:40.640,00:15:42.400,Men always break women's hearts.
00:15:41.980,00:15:43.930,如果救得了她 我必不伤她,00:15:43.000,00:15:44.000,"I will do my best to save her,"
,,,00:15:44.000,00:15:45.400,"and on my word, will never hurt her."
00:15:47.020,00:15:48.010,我会尽力去做的,00:15:48.040,00:15:49.110,I will try my best.
00:15:49.440,00:15:50.230,相信我,,,
00:15:50.990,00:15:51.980,就信你这一次,00:15:50.400,00:15:51.400,Please trust me.
00:15:52.950,00:15:53.810,来,00:15:51.880,00:15:53.120,I will trust you this one time.
,,,00:15:54.320,00:15:55.320,Here.
00:16:03.960,00:16:04.870,去请温太医了吗,,,
00:16:05.210,00:16:06.160,已经派人进宫去了,00:16:04.882,00:16:05.970,Have you asked Dr. Wen to come?
00:16:06.540,00:16:07.280,说是王爷不适,00:16:05.970,00:16:07.120,"I sent someone to the palace,"
00:16:07.630,00:16:08.490,一定要请温太医来看,00:16:07.240,00:16:09.480,"claiming that Your Lordship is sick and
requests only Dr. Wen."
00:16:09.460,00:16:10.620,只是这雪天路滑,,,
00:16:11.090,00:16:12.080,温太医上山不便,00:16:10.400,00:16:11.790,"However, the road is slippery when snowy."
00:16:12.380,00:16:13.210,再不便也得来啊,00:16:11.800,00:16:13.120,Dr. Wen might struggle coming here.
00:16:13.840,00:16:15.080,清凉台本来药物就不多,00:16:13.180,00:16:14.410,He has to come regardless!
00:16:15.390,00:16:16.420,娘子还一直高热不退,00:16:14.840,00:16:16.180,"The Cooling Palace lacks medication,"
,,,00:16:16.200,00:16:17.600,and the mistress has a high fever.
00:16:17.220,00:16:19.210,这样下去只怕不好,00:16:18.240,00:16:19.240,"If this goes on,"
00:16:19.520,00:16:20.930,已经拿冷水擦了那么多次了,00:16:19.400,00:16:20.400,she might be in danger.
,,,00:16:20.400,00:16:22.080,"We've tried cold water on her many times,"
00:16:21.270,00:16:23.510,可是小姐的高烧一点都没有退,00:16:22.160,00:16:24.360,but My Lady's fever hasn't come down at all.
00:16:23.850,00:16:24.680,这该如何是好啊,00:16:24.640,00:16:25.720,What can we do?
00:16:26.770,00:16:27.390,快,00:16:27.800,00:16:28.800,Quickly.
00:16:32.280,00:16:34.230,浣碧你忙了半天了,00:16:33.200,00:16:34.200,"Jade,"
00:16:34.740,00:16:36.350,先去休息吧别把自己累坏了,00:16:34.360,00:16:35.600,you've been busy all day.
00:16:36.700,00:16:37.440,可是小姐她,00:16:35.640,00:16:37.450,Take a rest. Don't exhaust yourself.
00:16:37.660,00:16:38.440,这里有人照顾,00:16:37.560,00:16:38.560,But My Lady...
00:16:39.200,00:16:40.240,你如果把自己累坏了,00:16:38.560,00:16:39.920,Other people can take care of her.
00:16:40.580,00:16:41.530,那就更没人照顾小姐了,00:16:40.120,00:16:42.560,"You won't be able to care for her
if you wear yourself out."
00:16:44.790,00:16:47.160,阿晋带浣碧姑娘下去休息,00:16:45.890,00:16:46.880,"Ajin,"
00:16:47.340,00:16:47.950,是,00:16:47.000,00:16:48.200,take Jade to have a rest.
00:16:48.960,00:16:50.080,浣碧姑娘 请,00:16:48.200,00:16:49.200,Yes.
,,,00:16:49.800,00:16:51.400,"Miss Jade, come with me."
00:16:51.510,00:16:52.540,那就有劳王爷了,00:16:52.440,00:16:53.640,I thank Your Lordship.
00:16:54.510,00:16:55.120,继续,00:16:55.440,00:16:56.486,Continue.
00:17:03.560,00:17:05.220,我看着娘子 你们也下去吧,00:17:04.660,00:17:05.640,I will watch the mistress.
00:17:05.730,00:17:06.430,是,00:17:05.640,00:17:06.640,You may leave too.

Please forgive me my lateness."
00:20:08.540,00:20:09.370,还开了个方子,00:20:07.360,00:20:08.960,"I brought some medicine to relieve the fever,"
00:20:09.950,00:20:11.540,劳烦先在王爷这里煎了吧,00:20:09.480,00:20:10.720,and wrote a prescription.
00:20:12.000,00:20:12.830,好快去,00:20:10.960,00:20:12.600,"May I trouble Your Lordship to brew
the medicine here?"
00:20:13.040,00:20:13.650,是,00:20:12.922,00:20:13.930,"Certainly. Go, quickly!"
00:20:15.670,00:20:16.450,娘子好些了吗,00:20:14.000,00:20:15.000,Yes.
00:20:17.670,00:20:18.710,幸好烧得不厉害,00:20:16.770,00:20:17.920,Is the mistress getting better?
,,,00:20:18.680,00:20:19.810,"Fortunately, her fever has come down."
00:20:19.670,00:20:22.210,若还是像通传时说的高热不退,00:20:20.640,00:20:23.320,"If she kept burning up as your servant said,"
00:20:22.590,00:20:23.210,那就麻烦了,,,
00:20:24.590,00:20:25.130,好,00:20:23.320,00:20:24.640,we would have had a problem.
00:20:26.140,00:20:27.090,我先去换身衣服,00:20:25.480,00:20:26.480,Good.
00:20:27.640,00:20:28.800,一会儿再过来看娘子,00:20:27.240,00:20:28.280,"I will go change now,"
,,,00:20:28.560,00:20:29.800,and check on her later.
00:20:35.860,00:20:37.470,王爷快去换件衣裳吧,00:20:36.960,00:20:38.560,"Your Lordship, you need to change your clothes!"
00:20:37.770,00:20:38.510,嘴唇都冻紫了,00:20:38.560,00:20:39.680,Your lips are blue.
00:20:40.320,00:20:41.560,不许跟任何人提起啊,00:20:41.360,00:20:42.660,Don't mention this to anyone!
00:20:44.280,00:20:45.900,王爷温太医来了吗,00:20:44.920,00:20:45.920,"Your Lordship,"
,,,00:20:45.920,00:20:47.000,is Dr. Wen here?
00:20:46.780,00:20:48.520,在里边呢 正要你照顾呢,00:20:47.680,00:20:48.680,He's in there.
00:20:49.200,00:20:50.360,王爷 你怎么了,00:20:48.680,00:20:49.800,You've come at a good time.
00:20:52.620,00:20:54.030,没事 走得急摔雪里了,00:20:50.120,00:20:51.800,"Your Lordship, what's wrong?"
00:20:54.420,00:20:55.200,你赶紧进去吧,00:20:53.720,00:20:55.200,"Nothing. I was walking too fast and
fell into the snow."
,,,00:20:55.320,00:20:56.320,Hurry and go inside now.
00:21:17.650,00:21:18.640,王爷您怎么又来了,00:21:18.600,00:21:19.740,"Your Lordship, why did you come in again?"
00:21:20.570,00:21:22.100,这儿有微臣您就放心吧,00:21:21.520,00:21:23.320,"I will stay here. Your Lordship
can put your mind at ease."
00:21:23.940,00:21:25.650,什么时候温太医给娘子看完病,00:21:25.040,00:21:26.800,"After you finish treating the mistress,"
00:21:26.320,00:21:27.060,也给我瞧瞧,,,
00:21:27.740,00:21:28.400,我这两日,00:21:27.080,00:21:28.200,please take a look at me as well.
,,,00:21:28.760,00:21:29.826,The past few days...
00:21:31.200,00:21:32.610,我这两日总是咳得厉害,00:21:32.300,00:21:33.710,The past few days I've been having a bad cough.
00:21:33.160,00:21:35.150,王爷您不好好休息 病情反复,00:21:34.072,00:21:36.200,"Your Lordship didn't rest well
and your symptoms persist."
00:21:35.460,00:21:36.410,反而不利于身体,,,
00:21:36.750,00:21:37.960,这不大家都忙着呢吗,00:21:36.240,00:21:37.600,Your Lordship should rest.
00:21:38.580,00:21:39.990,就我一个人闲着也过意不去,00:21:37.667,00:21:39.060,Everyone is busy.
,,,00:21:39.360,00:21:41.000,I feel bad being the only one resting.
00:21:41.380,00:21:42.460,特意过来瞧一瞧,00:21:42.160,00:21:43.560,So I came to check.
00:21:43.210,00:21:45.670,万一不适 好歹太医就在身边,00:21:44.000,00:21:45.000,"If I get any worse,"
,,,00:21:45.080,00:21:47.800,at least we have the doctor nearby.
00:21:47.050,00:21:49.130,浣碧姑娘 你已经熬了大半夜了,00:21:48.000,00:21:49.000,"Miss Jade,"
00:21:49.720,00:21:50.580,不如去休息吧,00:21:49.000,00:21:50.230,you've been up for most of the night.
,,,00:21:50.480,00:21:51.920,How about you go get some rest?
00:21:53.310,00:21:55.010,也好温大人,00:21:54.120,00:21:55.120,All right.
00:21:55.480,00:21:56.560,您也早点歇息吧,00:21:55.120,00:21:56.120,"Dr. Wen,"
00:21:58.230,00:21:59.440,要是您也累病了,00:21:56.320,00:21:57.812,You should rest soon as well.
00:21:59.690,00:22:00.640,谁来照顾小姐啊,00:21:59.142,00:22:01.760,"Who will look after My Lady if
you were to get sick as well?"
00:22:03.780,00:22:04.440,这样吧,00:22:04.840,00:22:05.840,How about this?
00:22:05.320,00:22:07.860,今晚我也留在这里,00:22:06.320,00:22:07.320,Tonight...
,,,00:22:08.120,00:22:09.120,"I'll stay here, too."
00:22:08.610,00:22:11.480,温太医和浣碧就在这儿将就睡下,00:22:09.600,00:22:12.580,Dr. Wen and Jade can sleep here tonight.
00:22:11.910,00:22:12.940,大家彼此都好照顾,00:22:12.840,00:22:14.040,So we can take care of each other.
00:22:15.330,00:22:16.280,多谢王爷体恤,00:22:16.200,00:22:17.380,I thank Your Lordship for your consideration.
00:22:56.450,00:22:57.860,小姐你醒了,00:22:57.440,00:22:59.000,"My Lady, you're awake!"
00:23:04.840,00:23:05.580,你好些了吗,,,
00:23:06.840,00:23:07.750,这是在哪儿,00:23:05.677,00:23:06.680,Are you feeling better?
00:23:08.670,00:23:09.460,这是清凉台,00:23:07.940,00:23:09.076,Where am I?
00:23:10.180,00:23:11.010,你病得太重了,00:23:09.544,00:23:10.720,The Cooling Terrace.
00:23:11.590,00:23:13.180,便把你接来清凉台照顾,00:23:11.017,00:23:12.110,You were seriously ill.
00:23:16.470,00:23:17.840,我真是高兴糊涂了,00:23:12.502,00:23:14.280,So we brought you here to look after you.
00:23:18.100,00:23:18.960,温大人就在那儿呢,00:23:17.280,00:23:18.978, I am so happy that I forgot to mention that
00:23:19.310,00:23:20.770,我快请他过来给小姐看看,00:23:18.978,00:23:20.000,Dr. Wen is right over there.
00:23:21.270,00:23:22.640,温大人 小姐醒了,00:23:20.000,00:23:21.460,I will ask him to come check on you.
00:23:22.860,00:23:23.470,快来啊,00:23:22.200,00:23:23.720,"Dr. Wen, My Lady is awake."
,,,00:23:23.720,00:23:24.720,Come!
00:23:29.360,00:23:31.190,是好多了是 好多了,00:23:30.197,00:23:31.320,She's much better!
00:23:32.320,00:23:33.190,既然好了,00:23:31.560,00:23:32.560,Much better.
,,,00:23:33.420,00:23:34.478,"Since I'm better now,"
00:23:34.740,00:23:36.150,那我们赶紧回去吧,00:23:35.720,00:23:37.250,we should go back soon.
00:23:37.540,00:23:39.820,身子还没好全 还得安心静养,00:23:38.602,00:23:41.200,"You are not fully recovered and
need to rest more."
00:23:40.790,00:23:42.030,清凉台少有人到访,,,
00:23:42.460,00:23:43.370,是最好的所在了,00:23:41.720,00:23:43.120,Few people come to the Cooling Terrace.
00:23:43.790,00:23:45.580,其实清凉台也未必好,00:23:43.120,00:23:44.470,It's the best place to be.
00:23:46.300,00:23:47.380,若是清凉台不好,00:23:44.680,00:23:46.680,Staying in the Cooling Terrace might not be good.
00:23:47.880,00:23:49.210,还有比这儿更好的所在吗,00:23:47.200,00:23:48.560,"If the Cooling Terrace is not good,"
,,,00:23:48.717,00:23:50.440,what place is better?
00:23:50.170,00:23:51.840,而且小姐现在身子这样,00:23:50.880,00:23:52.880,"Moreover, My Lady is in poor condition."
00:23:52.180,00:23:53.460,是能腾挪奔波的吗,00:23:52.940,00:23:54.720,How would she be able to travel?
00:23:57.310,00:23:58.140,槿汐呢,00:23:58.410,00:23:59.503,Where's Jinxi?
00:23:59.560,00:24:00.840,我陪小姐来了清凉台,00:24:00.472,00:24:01.940,"My Lady, I came with you to the Cooling Terrace."
00:24:01.520,00:24:02.760,槿汐去了凌云峰,00:24:02.560,00:24:03.920,Jinxi went to Peak Lingyun.
00:24:03.230,00:24:05.090,出了什么事好互相照应着,00:24:04.000,00:24:06.190,So the living quarters are attended to.
00:24:08.440,00:24:09.810,采蓝 采苹,00:24:09.520,00:24:10.910,"Iris, Lotus."
00:24:15.280,00:24:16.320,你这几日病着,00:24:16.192,00:24:17.480,"During the past few days when you've been sick,"
00:24:16.950,00:24:18.530,浣碧一个人照顾你十分的辛苦,00:24:17.800,00:24:19.880,"Jade has been working hard to
take care of you by herself."
00:24:19.410,00:24:21.030,这两日在外面煎药的事情,00:24:20.400,00:24:22.240,Iris and Lotus have been helping
00:24:21.540,00:24:23.070,都是采蓝和采苹在帮忙,00:24:22.280,00:24:24.120,to brew medicine outside for the past few days.
00:24:24.380,00:24:25.460,如今就让她们进来,00:24:25.320,00:24:26.720,Let's bring them inside to
00:24:26.170,00:24:27.280,和浣碧一同照顾你,00:24:27.000,00:24:28.530,help Jade take care of you.
00:24:34.680,00:24:37.670,王爷情况似乎不太对,00:24:35.554,00:24:36.720,His Lordship...
,,,00:24:37.200,00:24:38.520,doesn't seem well.
00:24:38.560,00:24:39.470,你且瞧瞧,00:24:39.246,00:24:40.570,Please attend to  him.
00:24:41.730,00:24:43.640,王爷是辛劳过度,00:24:42.600,00:24:43.600,His Lordship...
00:24:44.020,00:24:44.850,又着了风寒,00:24:43.720,00:24:44.800,"overexerted himself,"
00:24:45.350,00:24:46.390,是而引起了发热,00:24:44.840,00:24:46.063,"and caught a cold,"
00:24:47.770,00:24:49.730,赶紧捂着被子睡一觉发发汗,00:24:46.063,00:24:47.320,which caused a fever.
00:24:50.110,00:24:51.390,我再开一个疏散的方子,00:24:48.520,00:24:51.000,"His Lordship needs to sleep under thick covers
to sweat out the cold."
00:24:51.650,00:24:52.360,也就好了,00:24:51.000,00:24:52.480,I will also write a prescription for fever.
00:24:52.900,00:24:53.640,有劳太医了,00:24:52.480,00:24:53.640,Then he will be better.
,,,00:24:53.960,00:24:55.041,"Thank you, Dr. Wen."
00:24:55.610,00:24:57.860,阿晋 快进来扶王爷一把,00:24:56.480,00:24:57.480,"Ajin,"
,,,00:24:57.480,00:24:58.960,come help His Lordship.
00:25:04.460,00:25:05.200,看来,00:25:05.480,00:25:06.480,It looks like...
00:25:06.630,00:25:08.240,看来我是少不得要睡一觉了,00:25:07.640,00:25:09.340,It looks like I have to get some sleep.
00:25:09.420,00:25:10.540,娘子要好好休息啊,00:25:10.257,00:25:11.640,You need to rest well.
00:25:14.590,00:25:15.500,我扶王爷出去,00:25:15.464,00:25:16.600,I'll help His Lordship out.
00:25:18.890,00:25:19.920,我这里不要紧,00:25:19.576,00:25:21.020,I'm all right here.
00:25:21.310,00:25:22.640,你去看看他吧,00:25:22.320,00:25:23.740,Please go take a look at him.
00:25:27.770,00:25:28.730,你很关心他呀,00:25:28.640,00:25:29.960,You seem very concerned about him.
00:25:32.740,00:25:34.320,果郡王一向仗义,00:25:33.600,00:25:35.420,Noble Prince Guo has always acted on my behalf.
00:25:35.490,00:25:37.070,如今又是这儿的东道主,00:25:36.320,00:25:38.170,"He is the host here,"
00:25:37.990,00:25:39.200,拼死救了我,00:25:38.902,00:25:40.413,who risked his life to save mine.
00:25:41.790,00:25:45.530,我不过是寻常问候两句而已,00:25:42.664,00:25:43.811,I'm only...
,,,00:25:44.600,00:25:46.200,paying my respects.
00:25:47.120,00:25:49.080,你连日照顾我也很辛苦,00:25:47.994,00:25:50.240,"You, too, have been working hard,
looking after me for days."
00:25:50.040,00:25:51.330,也赶紧去歇歇吧,00:25:50.914,00:25:52.430,You should go and get some rest as well.
00:25:59.600,00:26:02.090,那好吧你先好好休息,00:26:00.520,00:26:01.801,All right.
00:26:03.140,00:26:03.930,我去看看王爷,00:26:02.240,00:26:03.240,Rest well.
,,,00:26:04.080,00:26:05.320,I will go and check on His Lordship.
00:26:11.770,00:26:13.310,王爷身体的底子一向都好,00:26:12.692,00:26:14.400,His Lordship has always been in good health.
00:26:13.780,00:26:15.230,得了一点风寒不成大碍,00:26:14.760,00:26:16.400,A common cold isn't serious for him.
00:26:15.990,00:26:17.400,让他好好休息一下就是了,00:26:17.000,00:26:18.500,Just ask His Lordship to rest well.
00:26:18.240,00:26:18.900,多谢大人,,,
00:26:19.360,00:26:20.730,奴才已经命人打扫了客房,00:26:19.040,00:26:20.040,"Thank you, Dr. Wen."
00:26:21.030,00:26:21.820,大人先去歇息,00:26:20.240,00:26:21.800,I have had a room prepared for you.
00:26:22.330,00:26:22.910,好,00:26:21.840,00:26:22.920,Please take a rest there.
00:26:29.040,00:26:29.700,阿晋,00:26:23.320,00:26:24.320,Good.
00:26:31.250,00:26:32.040,姑娘怎么来了,00:26:30.080,00:26:31.080,Ajin!
00:26:32.920,00:26:33.780,王爷还好吗,00:26:32.200,00:26:33.200,"What is it, Jade?"
00:26:34.800,00:26:36.210,倒不是险症 还好,00:26:34.020,00:26:35.120,Is His Lordship all right?
,,,00:26:35.800,00:26:37.400,It's not serious. He is all right.
00:26:37.420,00:26:39.290,阿晋我问你件事,00:26:38.240,00:26:39.240,"Ajin,"
00:26:39.720,00:26:40.330,你说就是,00:26:39.240,00:26:40.390,I want to ask you something.
,,,00:26:40.480,00:26:41.480,Certainly.
00:26:42.010,00:26:43.750,采蓝和采苹,00:26:43.000,00:26:44.840,Iris and Lotus...
00:26:45.020,00:26:46.100,她们伺候得不好吗,00:26:46.000,00:26:47.200,Did they do something wrong?
00:26:46.770,00:26:48.930,我瞧她们的打扮不像平常的丫头,00:26:47.692,00:26:50.000,"They don't dress like ordinary maids,"
00:26:49.480,00:26:50.560,倒像是半个姨娘,00:26:50.402,00:26:51.660,and dress almost like concubines.
00:26:51.610,00:26:52.810,我哪敢使唤她们呀,,,
00:26:53.400,00:26:54.010,什么,00:26:52.560,00:26:54.088,I dare not order them around.
00:26:54.530,00:26:56.360,她们不是王爷的贴身侍碑,00:26:54.400,00:26:55.400,What?
00:26:56.990,00:26:58.020,通房的丫髻吗,00:26:55.440,00:26:57.714,"Are they His Lordship's personal maids,"
00:26:58.400,00:26:59.230,姑娘真会说笑,00:26:57.714,00:26:59.013,who serve him overnight?
00:26:59.660,00:27:01.490,王爷近身伺候的只有我罢了,00:26:59.322,00:27:00.330,You are being funny.
00:27:01.780,00:27:02.740,她们只是这里的丫头,00:27:00.520,00:27:02.457,I'm the only one who serves His Lordship by his side.
00:27:03.330,00:27:03.980,你不知道,00:27:02.480,00:27:03.720,They are only ordinary maids.
00:27:04.240,00:27:05.820,这清凉台伺候的丫头仆从,00:27:04.320,00:27:06.720,"You may not know that all the servants
here in the Cooling Terrace"
00:27:06.160,00:27:06.950,都是漂泊无依的,00:27:06.720,00:27:08.080,were nomads and had no one to rely on.
00:27:07.250,00:27:09.030,被王爷救了回来才来这里服侍,00:27:08.080,00:27:09.952,His Lordship saved them and let them serve here.
00:27:09.410,00:27:10.700,断不会存了非分之想,00:27:10.280,00:27:11.800,They would never have improper thoughts.
00:27:11.460,00:27:13.700,姑娘不知道 你们娘子必然知道,00:27:12.480,00:27:14.680,"You may not know, but I'm sure the mistress does."
00:27:14.500,00:27:16.660,咱们王爷是不会有妾侍侧妃的,00:27:15.600,00:27:18.000,His Lordship doesn't want any Lord Consorts or Concubines.
00:27:17.130,00:27:19.090,若是有也只会有一位福晋,00:27:18.000,00:27:20.000,He will marry only one wife.
00:27:30.810,00:27:33.680,阿晋 你们家王爷好些了吗,00:27:31.840,00:27:32.867,"Ajin,"
00:27:33.980,00:27:34.850,风寒一直未退,00:27:33.400,00:27:34.600,is His Lordship getting better?
,,,00:27:34.840,00:27:35.960,"He hasn't recovered from the cold,"
00:27:35.190,00:27:37.310,这几天除了喝药什么都吃不下,00:27:36.112,00:27:38.232,and hasn't consumed anything but the medicine.
00:27:37.690,00:27:38.650,人也瘦了许多,00:27:38.600,00:27:39.640,He is losing weight too.
00:27:39.360,00:27:40.850,怎么会突然病得这么重呢,00:27:40.282,00:27:41.772,How did it become so severe?
00:27:45.830,00:27:48.320,你们先退下吧我和阿晋说说话,00:27:46.800,00:27:47.988,You may leave now.
00:27:48.790,00:27:49.450,是,00:27:47.988,00:27:49.420,I'd like to talk with Ajin in private.
00:27:55.040,00:27:56.280,我们王爷是个傻子,00:27:49.890,00:27:50.880,Yes.
00:27:56.750,00:27:57.910,他喜欢不该喜欢的人,00:27:56.140,00:27:57.380,"His Lordship is a fool,"
00:27:58.340,00:27:59.670,做常人不会做的傻事,00:27:57.560,00:27:58.960,who likes someone he shouldn't care for
,,,00:27:59.160,00:28:00.680,and does senseless things that others wouldn't.
00:28:00.800,00:28:01.750,那日娘子高热,00:28:01.722,00:28:02.880,"You had a high fever the other day,"
00:28:02.300,00:28:03.960,敷了多少冷毛巾也不中用,00:28:03.080,00:28:05.000,and icy towels didn't bring your temperature down.
00:28:04.430,00:28:06.590,于是我们王爷穿着贴身的中衣,00:28:05.352,00:28:06.542,So His Lordship
00:28:06.930,00:28:07.720,躺在冰雪里,00:28:06.764,00:28:08.933,"lay in the snow with only light clothing on,"
00:28:08.310,00:28:09.640,等自己身子冷透了之后,,,
00:28:09.980,00:28:10.680,再抱着娘子,00:28:09.200,00:28:11.939,and chilled you with his own body.
00:28:11.390,00:28:12.380,如此反复多次,00:28:12.312,00:28:13.568,"After several rounds,"
00:28:12.900,00:28:14.480,让娘子的高热退了下来,00:28:13.800,00:28:15.580,your fever finally broke.
00:28:15.110,00:28:16.020,这样连番辛苦,00:28:16.210,00:28:17.253,"After doing this repeatedly,"
00:28:16.400,00:28:18.140,饶身子是铁打的也扛不住啊,00:28:17.320,00:28:19.240,it was a certainty that he would fall ill.
00:28:19.690,00:28:22.110,不过娘子放心,00:28:20.790,00:28:21.760,But...
00:28:22.450,00:28:24.110,我们王爷断不敢轻薄娘子,00:28:22.400,00:28:23.400,"Don't worry, Mistress."
00:28:24.450,00:28:25.940,那日娘子穿得整整齐齐的,00:28:23.400,00:28:24.988,His Lordship would never act disrespectfully toward you.
,,,00:28:25.240,00:28:27.173,You were fully dressed the whole time.
00:28:27.530,00:28:29.490,我们王爷发傻也不是头一回了,00:28:28.452,00:28:30.412,It's not the first time His Lordship has done reckless things.
00:28:30.250,00:28:31.910,自从闯进翊坤宫救下娘子,00:28:31.172,00:28:32.832,"Ever since he rescued you in the
Palace of Earthly Honor,"
00:28:32.410,00:28:33.150,奴才就知道,00:28:33.320,00:28:34.320,I knew that
00:28:33.580,00:28:35.160,王爷的傻病救不好了,00:28:34.520,00:28:36.260,His Lordship's foolishness would never be cured.
00:28:37.210,00:28:40.250,你对我说这些是为了什么,00:28:38.120,00:28:39.400,These things...
00:28:41.170,00:28:41.910,奴才不知道,00:28:40.320,00:28:41.440,Why do you tell me?
00:28:42.220,00:28:43.380,王爷做这些白费心思的事,,,
00:28:43.590,00:28:44.330,是为了什么,00:28:42.240,00:28:45.360,I don't know why His Lordship makes these futile efforts.
00:28:44.720,00:28:45.300,可奴才知道,,,
00:28:45.640,00:28:47.090,王爷是真的费尽了心思,00:28:45.560,00:28:46.560,"But I know,"
,,,00:28:46.560,00:28:48.012,His Lordship really did everything he could.
00:28:49.680,00:28:51.510,难为你们家王爷一片心意,00:28:50.780,00:28:52.610,I appreciate His Lordship's thoughts.
00:28:53.310,00:28:54.270,如今王爷病了,00:28:54.240,00:28:55.320,His Lordship is sick now.
00:28:54.650,00:28:56.930,娘子若有空可否也去看看王爷,00:28:55.480,00:28:56.680,"Mistress, if you have time,"
00:28:57.360,00:28:58.640,我是清凉台的客人,00:28:56.680,00:28:57.852,will you go to visit him?
,,,00:28:58.282,00:28:59.784,I am a guest in the Cooling Terrace.
00:28:59.570,00:29:01.850,去看你家王爷是理所应当的,00:29:00.520,00:29:02.950,It's only proper that I pay His Lordship a visit.
00:29:02.610,00:29:03.730,你不说我也会去,00:29:03.600,00:29:04.916,I would go regardless.
00:29:04.360,00:29:06.450,我若不说娘子是糊里糊涂去,00:29:05.449,00:29:07.550,"You wouldn't understand the circumstances
if I didn't tell you."
00:29:07.240,00:29:08.980,这清凉台糊涂的人不少,00:29:08.162,00:29:09.902,There are many fools in the Cooling Terrace.
00:29:09.410,00:29:10.570,有人糊里糊涂高兴,00:29:10.320,00:29:11.560,Some fools are happy for their own reasons
00:29:10.910,00:29:11.900,有人糊里糊涂不说,00:29:11.680,00:29:13.000,while some fools won't speak up.
00:29:12.450,00:29:14.240,王爷也不会直接说与娘子听,00:29:13.400,00:29:15.162,His Lordship won't share this with you.
00:29:14.620,00:29:16.110,还是得我阿晋来说,00:29:15.454,00:29:16.944,That's why I have to.
00:29:18.250,00:29:18.990,那么,00:29:19.172,00:29:20.120,"Then,"
00:29:19.670,00:29:22.160,你陪我一起去看看你家王爷吧,00:29:20.548,00:29:23.038,please accompany me to visit His Lordship.
00:29:28.760,00:29:30.590,太妃来看过王爷了吗,00:29:29.860,00:29:31.690,"Did Her Venerable Highness come
to visit His Lordship?"
00:29:31.100,00:29:33.260,太妃今生今世都不能出安栖观的,00:29:32.120,00:29:34.227,"Her Venerable Highness is not
allowed to leave the Anqi temple."
00:29:33.560,00:29:34.760,王爷病了的事还瞒着呢,00:29:34.227,00:29:36.080,"So we never sent news about
His Lordship's illness to Her Venerable Highness."
00:29:36.480,00:29:38.690,先瞒着吧免得太妃担心,00:29:37.480,00:29:38.480,Keep it that way for now.
,,,00:29:38.480,00:29:39.790,"Otherwise, Her Venerable Highness would be worried."
00:30:04.050,00:30:04.710,你来了,00:30:04.800,00:30:05.810,You are here.
00:30:06.260,00:30:07.090,你好些了吗,00:30:07.138,00:30:08.280,Are you feeling better?
00:30:09.760,00:30:11.130,已经能站在你面前了,00:30:10.771,00:30:12.365,I am able to come here.
00:30:11.680,00:30:12.420,你说好了吗,00:30:12.365,00:30:13.600,Isn't it obvious?
00:30:14.600,00:30:15.300,来多久了,00:30:15.522,00:30:16.755,How long have you been here?
00:30:16.230,00:30:17.090,不过一个时辰,00:30:17.110,00:30:18.120,Only two hours.
00:30:17.730,00:30:19.810,看你睡得香就没叫醒你,00:30:18.608,00:30:19.720,You were sound asleep.
,,,00:30:19.720,00:30:20.800,So I didn't want to wake you.
00:30:24.860,00:30:26.570,要不要喝点水允礼,00:30:25.880,00:30:27.960,"Do you want some water, Yunli?"
00:30:28.240,00:30:28.940,你叫我什么,00:30:29.029,00:30:30.400,What did you call me?
00:30:36.080,00:30:38.790,嬛儿我不是在做梦吧,00:30:37.058,00:30:38.074,"Huan'er,"
,,,00:30:38.840,00:30:40.000,am I dreaming?
00:30:40.830,00:30:42.170,先喝口水润润吧,00:30:41.800,00:30:43.360,Drink some water first.
00:30:47.260,00:30:48.920,王爷皇上和敬妃他们来了,00:30:48.049,00:30:50.020,"Your Lordship, His Majesty and
Consort Estime are here."
00:30:50.800,00:30:51.540,皇上怎么来了,00:30:51.440,00:30:52.862,Why did His Majesty come?
00:30:52.930,00:30:53.420,我,,,
00:30:53.640,00:30:54.380,出门就要撞上了,00:30:53.720,00:30:54.480,I...
00:30:55.100,00:30:55.710,我,00:30:54.480,00:30:55.840,You will run into them if you leave now.
00:30:57.020,00:30:57.760,那儿有个屏风,00:30:56.120,00:30:57.120,I...
00:30:58.140,00:30:58.930,先到后面避一避,00:30:57.920,00:30:59.000,There is a screen.
,,,00:30:59.080,00:31:00.341,You can hide behind it.
00:30:59.690,00:31:02.020,皇上驾到,00:31:00.680,00:31:02.920,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:31:03.730,00:31:04.850,老十七不在,00:31:04.519,00:31:05.950,"Without Lord XVII,"
00:31:05.780,00:31:08.690,连个和朕谈诗论画的人都没有了,00:31:06.880,00:31:09.790,I have no one to talk with about poems and paintings.
00:31:09.820,00:31:10.530,臣弟给,00:31:10.840,00:31:11.840,Peace to...
00:31:11.410,00:31:13.650,既病着 就不要拘礼数了,00:31:12.360,00:31:13.362,"Since you're sick,"
00:31:14.120,00:31:14.950,王爷安好,00:31:13.362,00:31:14.750,don't be bound by formalities.
,,,00:31:15.080,00:31:16.080,Peace to Your Lordship.
00:31:17.620,00:31:19.830,皇兄跟敬妃娘娘今儿个兴致真好,00:31:18.720,00:31:20.930,"Your Majesty and Your Highness
seem to be in a good mood."
00:31:20.620,00:31:21.740,只是怎么突然想到,,,
00:31:22.130,00:31:22.960,到臣弟这儿来了,00:31:21.454,00:31:23.840,But what suddenly brought you here?
00:31:23.340,00:31:24.450,难得雪化了,00:31:24.218,00:31:25.506,The snow finally melted.
00:31:25.300,00:31:26.960,整日闷在宫里也是无趣,00:31:26.222,00:31:27.882,It's boring to spend all day in the palace.
00:31:27.260,00:31:28.090,出来走走,00:31:28.138,00:31:29.120,I decided to take a short trip.
00:31:28.630,00:31:30.620,路过你这儿 听说你病了,00:31:29.552,00:31:31.542,"As we were passing by, I heard of your illness."
00:31:31.930,00:31:34.590,果然还有病色 只是精神还好,00:31:33.030,00:31:34.317,"Although you still look pale,"
,,,00:31:34.317,00:31:35.400,your spirit is high.
00:31:35.890,00:31:38.600,是啊 胧月听说十七皇叔病了,00:31:36.990,00:31:39.700,"Longyue heard that her Uncle XVII is sick,"
00:31:39.020,00:31:40.850,特地来看望十七皇叔呢,00:31:39.800,00:31:41.950,so she specifically came to visit you.
00:31:43.480,00:31:44.310,胧月也来了,00:31:44.360,00:31:45.600,Longyue is here too!
00:31:55.490,00:31:57.360,好了好了十七皇叔病着呢,00:31:56.440,00:31:58.371,All right. All right. Your Uncle XVII is sick.
00:31:57.700,00:31:59.280,胧月不要闹十七皇叔了,00:31:58.622,00:32:00.202,"Longyue, don't bother him anymore."
00:32:01.420,00:32:02.660,这丫头鬼精灵着呢,00:32:02.178,00:32:03.520,She is a clever girl.
00:32:03.080,00:32:05.320,她知道你病了不肯要你抱,00:32:03.914,00:32:05.001,"She knows you are sick,"
,,,00:32:05.001,00:32:06.400,and doesn't want you to hold her.
00:32:06.090,00:32:09.170,那股机灵劲和她额娘一模一样,00:32:07.000,00:32:10.270,She is as smart as her mother.
00:32:13.090,00:32:13.800,老十七,00:32:14.000,00:32:15.110,"Lord XVII,"
00:32:14.550,00:32:16.040,这些日子你没来宫里,00:32:15.360,00:32:17.320,"it's been a while since the last time
you visited the palace."
00:32:16.600,00:32:17.680,连朕都闷得慌,00:32:17.320,00:32:18.558,I'm terribly bored.
00:32:18.520,00:32:21.130,连个和朕说说诗词歌赋的人,,,
00:32:21.350,00:32:22.060,都没有,00:32:19.442,00:32:23.360,I don't even have someone to talk to about poetry and prose.
00:32:24.060,00:32:25.800,若是当年她还在,00:32:24.920,00:32:27.122,If she were still here...
00:32:35.870,00:32:38.900,臣弟幼时就常听皇兄和皇嫂,00:32:36.970,00:32:38.301,"When l was young,"
,,,00:32:38.360,00:32:40.000,"When young, I often heard Your Majesty and Empress Première"
00:32:39.410,00:32:41.490,谈词论赋一同和歌,00:32:40.120,00:32:42.590,discussing poetry and prose and writing together.
,,,00:32:42.832,00:32:43.878,"After that,"
00:32:41.910,00:32:45.950,后来也只有甄氏能跟朕说上几句,00:32:43.878,00:32:46.872,only Zhen could hold a conversation with me.
00:32:47.170,00:32:49.580,只可惜 她太不受教了,00:32:48.000,00:32:49.067,"Unfortunately,"
,,,00:32:49.067,00:32:50.680,she's incorrigible.
00:32:53.180,00:32:54.920,甄氏 甄氏,00:32:54.120,00:32:55.920,Zhen! Zhen!
00:32:58.470,00:33:01.050,你知道是谁吗 你就跟着学,00:32:59.520,00:33:01.000,Do you even know who that is?
,,,00:33:01.000,00:33:02.240,You sure know how to repeat words!
00:33:04.850,00:33:07.770,你的清凉台一直听说很好,00:33:05.772,00:33:08.692,I've heard about your Cooling Terrace for a long time.
00:33:08.570,00:33:10.900,今日一见果然是个好地方,00:33:09.492,00:33:10.480,"Now that I've seen it,"
,,,00:33:10.480,00:33:11.822,it indeed deserves its reputation.
00:33:11.530,00:33:13.730,皇兄如果喜欢常常来坐就是了,00:33:12.560,00:33:13.625,"If Your Majesty likes it here,"
,,,00:33:13.625,00:33:14.830,come visit more often.
00:33:14.610,00:33:16.480,出宫一趟多难哪,00:33:15.532,00:33:17.402,It's so difficult to take a trip out of the palace.
00:33:16.990,00:33:18.950,多少言官的眼睛盯着呢,00:33:17.912,00:33:19.872,Many civil officials are watching me closely.
00:33:21.330,00:33:24.740,清凉台虽好缺个女主人,00:33:22.320,00:33:24.079,"As good as the Cooling Terrace is,"
00:33:26.040,00:33:27.200,你年纪不小了,00:33:24.320,00:33:25.662,it needs a lady of the house.
00:33:27.580,00:33:29.370,是该纳福晋的时候了,00:33:26.829,00:33:28.320,You are not young anymore.
00:33:29.750,00:33:30.410,再说吧,00:33:28.520,00:33:30.470,It's time to get married.
00:33:31.210,00:33:32.040,如果有中意的,00:33:30.720,00:33:31.720,It can wait.
,,,00:33:32.132,00:33:33.362,"If I meet someone I like,"
00:33:33.010,00:33:35.120,臣弟一定把她奉为清凉台的主人,00:33:33.880,00:33:36.320,"I surely will honor her as the mistress of the Cooling Terrace,"
00:33:36.340,00:33:37.170,一生呵护,00:33:37.280,00:33:38.400,and cherish her for life.
00:33:38.010,00:33:39.500,你自己有了主意也好,00:33:38.840,00:33:40.400,It would be good if you have someone in mind.
00:33:40.470,00:33:44.310,你若喜欢朕先从世家女子中,00:33:41.400,00:33:42.673,"If you want,"
00:33:44.680,00:33:46.350,挑几个好的给你留着,00:33:42.960,00:33:47.640,"I can pick some suitable ladies from
 distinguished families and you can choose."
00:33:48.400,00:33:49.480,皇兄说笑了,00:33:49.440,00:33:50.920,Your Majesty must be joking.
00:33:52.980,00:33:54.020,天不早了,,,
00:33:55.030,00:33:56.390,回去还要看折子,00:33:53.920,00:33:55.280,It's getting late.
00:33:57.320,00:33:58.310,你且好好养着,00:33:56.130,00:33:57.490,I have to go back and read the memorandums.
00:33:58.700,00:33:59.360,是,00:33:58.194,00:33:59.410,You should rest well.
,,,00:33:59.800,00:34:00.460,Yes.
00:34:01.700,00:34:02.440,不必了,00:34:02.499,00:34:03.540,There's no need.
00:34:03.290,00:34:04.870,把病养好了要紧,00:34:04.202,00:34:05.970,It's more important for you to recover.
00:34:08.290,00:34:09.450,路上滑 皇兄慢走,00:34:09.202,00:34:10.851,"The road is slippery.
Please be careful, Your Majesty."
00:34:25.180,00:34:25.840,他已经走了,00:34:25.800,00:34:26.800,He has left.
00:34:37.530,00:34:38.640,即便皇兄不肯承认,,,
00:34:39.280,00:34:40.490,你终究是胧月的额娘,00:34:38.404,00:34:40.154,"Even though His Majesty doesn't want to acknowledge it,"
00:34:41.280,00:34:42.490,这是谁都改变不了的,00:34:40.154,00:34:41.929,You are Longyue's mother after all.
00:34:43.700,00:34:44.990,胧月不知道也好,00:34:42.117,00:34:43.590,No one can change that.
,,,00:34:44.720,00:34:46.600,It's good that Longyue does not know about me.
00:34:46.870,00:34:50.030,有我这样的额娘是她的耻辱,00:34:47.669,00:34:49.720,Having me as her mother...
00:34:50.210,00:34:50.870,胡说,00:34:49.920,00:34:51.920,"- Brings shame to her.
- Nonsense!"
00:34:51.420,00:34:52.450,胧月有你这样的额娘,00:34:52.181,00:34:54.040,To have you as her mother
00:34:53.500,00:34:54.540,是她最大的骄傲,00:34:54.400,00:34:56.347,is her greatest pride.
00:34:55.510,00:34:56.240,王爷,00:34:56.347,00:34:57.320,Your Lordship...
00:34:58.010,00:35:00.500,嬛儿你怎么又这样叫我,00:34:58.884,00:35:00.390,"Huan’er,"
,,,00:35:00.390,00:35:01.760,why are you calling me that again?
00:35:02.260,00:35:03.750,方才是莫愁失仪了,00:35:03.000,00:35:05.226,I lost my manners earlier.
00:35:04.390,00:35:05.500,还希望王爷见谅,00:35:05.226,00:35:06.600,Please forgive me.
00:35:06.810,00:35:10.140,还请王爷像从前一样称呼我吧,00:35:07.609,00:35:09.668,"Your Lordship, please address me"
,,,00:35:09.668,00:35:11.240,the same way as before.
00:35:10.770,00:35:11.730,是因为皇兄吗,00:35:11.644,00:35:12.830,Is it because of His Majesty?
00:35:13.150,00:35:16.980,皇上的到来只会叫我更加清醒,00:35:14.250,00:35:15.525,His Majesty's visit
,,,00:35:16.440,00:35:18.080,woke me up.
00:35:19.320,00:35:20.780,方才是我糊涂了,00:35:20.232,00:35:22.068,"I made a mistake earlier,"
00:35:21.820,00:35:23.060,是我冒犯了王爷,00:35:22.619,00:35:24.160,and was disrespectful to Your Lordship.
00:35:25.370,00:35:26.860,皇兄从来没有来过清凉台,00:35:26.169,00:35:27.960,His Majesty has never come to the Cooling Terrace.
00:35:27.910,00:35:29.780,我也不知道他怎么会突然就来了,00:35:28.747,00:35:31.000,I don't know why he suddenly came today.
00:35:30.790,00:35:33.500,他也许是一时兴起突然至此,00:35:31.589,00:35:34.600,He visited me on a whim.
00:35:34.290,00:35:35.450,可于我于你世间的事,00:35:35.127,00:35:36.550,"- But to me and you...
- The world is..."
00:35:37.340,00:35:38.750,往往都是想不到的,00:35:38.080,00:35:39.850,full of the unexpected.
00:35:39.550,00:35:41.130,你刚才说的话不是这样的,00:35:40.424,00:35:42.230,That's not what you said earlier.
00:35:44.550,00:35:46.040,我们已经打扰王爷多日,00:35:45.387,00:35:47.240,We have been troubling Your Lordship for many days.
00:35:48.180,00:35:49.390,外头雪已经化了,00:35:49.167,00:35:50.565,The snow has melted.
00:35:51.560,00:35:52.800,我们明日便告辞了,00:35:52.359,00:35:54.175,"We will take our leave tomorrow,"
00:35:53.730,00:35:54.890,去凌云峰禅房,00:35:54.400,00:35:56.000,and go to the living quarters on Peak Lingyun.
00:35:56.940,00:35:59.900,连日来多谢王爷,00:35:57.701,00:35:59.200,"For the past few days,"
,,,00:36:00.000,00:36:01.200,I thank Your Lordship.
00:36:26.600,00:36:27.430,吃药吧,00:36:27.437,00:36:28.793,Please take your medicine.
00:36:32.690,00:36:34.180,小姐的身子是好多了,00:36:33.451,00:36:35.204,"My Lady, your health has improved a lot."
00:36:36.150,00:36:37.760,不知道王爷有没有好一点,00:36:36.960,00:36:38.860,I wonder if His Lordship has regained his strength.
00:36:42.070,00:36:42.780,会好的,00:36:42.944,00:36:44.331,He will be better.
00:36:44.410,00:36:47.070,快到春天了一切都会好的,00:36:45.134,00:36:46.806,Spring is coming.
,,,00:36:46.806,00:36:48.471,Everything will be better.
00:36:55.380,00:36:57.160,今日是三月初三上巳节,00:36:56.217,00:36:58.636,"Today is the third day of March -
the Double Third Festival."
00:36:57.710,00:36:59.540,咱们带上些节礼去看太妃,00:36:58.636,00:37:00.640,And we're bringing gifts for the Consort Dowager.
00:36:59.840,00:37:00.750,太妃一定很高兴,,,
00:37:01.340,00:37:02.580,我们也好久没见太妃了,00:37:00.640,00:37:01.850,The Consort Dowager will surely be delighted.
00:37:02.880,00:37:03.620,是该去瞧瞧呢,00:37:02.214,00:37:03.680,We haven't seen the Consort Dowager in a long time.
00:37:06.970,00:37:07.710,今天天好,00:37:03.680,00:37:05.000,It's about time for us to visit.
00:37:08.010,00:37:09.470,你也难得愿意出来走走,00:37:07.694,00:37:08.880,The weather is nice today.
,,,00:37:08.880,00:37:10.570,A beautiful day for you to come here.
00:37:10.640,00:37:11.970,许久不来看太妃了,00:37:11.480,00:37:13.320,I haven't visited Your Venerable Highness in a long time.
00:37:12.520,00:37:13.350,真是我失礼了,00:37:13.320,00:37:14.400,Please forgive me.
00:37:14.310,00:37:15.140,太妃安好,00:37:15.034,00:37:16.000,Peace to Your Venerable Highness.
00:37:17.150,00:37:18.310,这样花开时节,00:37:17.874,00:37:19.800,"In a season of such blossoms,"
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.730,倒想听一听琴呢,00:37:20.000,00:37:22.169,I long to hear the zither.
00:37:21.940,00:37:24.560,上次损坏的琴弦我已经修好了,00:37:22.664,00:37:25.857,I've fixed the zither you brought here last time.
00:37:24.860,00:37:26.950,你也正好来试试称不称手,00:37:25.857,00:37:28.050,You can take the chance to try it out.
00:37:27.820,00:37:29.490,儿子正好带着长相守,00:37:28.657,00:37:30.590,I happen to have my flute with me.
00:37:30.160,00:37:31.150,可与娘子同奏,00:37:30.997,00:37:32.250,We can play together.
00:37:32.580,00:37:33.860,久闻娘子琴技甚好,00:37:33.529,00:37:35.148,I have long heard of your excellent skill with the zither.
00:37:34.330,00:37:35.620,不知可否同奏一曲,00:37:35.148,00:37:36.800,I wonder if you would play a song with me.
00:37:37.500,00:37:39.080,长相思的旧主人在此,00:37:38.412,00:37:40.406,The original owner of Endless Longing is here.
00:37:39.840,00:37:41.170,我怎敢夸口琴技呢,00:37:40.556,00:37:42.320,How could I boast about my skill?
00:37:42.170,00:37:44.710,与王爷合奏我也从未试过,00:37:43.082,00:37:45.998,I've never played with Your Lordship.
00:37:45.430,00:37:46.920,怕是跟不上王爷的笛声,00:37:46.040,00:37:48.372,I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up with Your Lordship's flute.
00:37:48.430,00:37:52.260,先帝去世以后我不再碰长相思,00:37:49.380,00:37:51.193,"After the prior emperor passed away,"
,,,00:37:51.400,00:37:53.400,I stopped playing Endless Longing.
00:37:53.600,00:37:56.680,这合奏之音也再不曾听闻过了,00:37:54.173,00:37:57.880,And I haven't heard them being played together since.
00:37:58.350,00:38:00.810,请娘子全一全,00:37:59.400,00:38:00.854,"Mistress,"
00:38:01.150,00:38:02.480,我这未亡人的心愿吧,00:38:01.400,00:38:03.840,please grant this widow's wish and play.
00:38:03.440,00:38:04.350,有生之年,,,
00:38:04.740,00:38:06.020,我还真想再听一听,00:38:04.400,00:38:05.710,"While I'm still alive,"
00:38:06.360,00:38:07.850,这长相思和长相守,00:38:05.710,00:38:09.000,I long to hear the harmonious sound of
00:38:08.200,00:38:09.560,齐发齐奏之音呢,00:38:09.000,00:38:10.961,Endless Longing and Eternal Promise again.
00:38:11.280,00:38:12.360,太妃既有此言,00:38:12.233,00:38:13.520,"Since Your Venerable Highness says so,"
00:38:12.990,00:38:14.230,那我相拒不如从命,00:38:13.901,00:38:15.400,I'm honored to obey.
00:38:16.540,00:38:17.570,奏什么好呢,00:38:17.415,00:38:18.934,What shall we play?
00:38:18.500,00:38:19.360,长相思,00:38:19.412,00:38:20.874,"- Endless Longing?
- Endless Longing."
00:38:25.510,00:38:27.000,你们俩倒是心意相通,00:38:26.240,00:38:28.400,You two are of the same mind.
00:38:27.880,00:38:29.220,只因琴名长相思,00:38:28.754,00:38:30.690,His Lordship and I only thought of the same song
00:38:29.590,00:38:31.710,是而我与王爷都想到了此处,00:38:30.690,00:38:32.680,because the zither's name is Endless Longing.
00:38:38.100,00:38:39.720,我虽不太懂文墨,00:38:38.974,00:38:41.234,"Even though I'm not well-read,"
00:38:40.520,00:38:42.680,李白的长相思我还是知道的,00:38:41.620,00:38:43.968,I do know Li Bai's Endless Longing.
00:38:43.780,00:38:45.610,不如就这首吧,00:38:44.800,00:38:47.124,Let's hear it.
00:39:07.590,00:39:09.000,长相思,00:39:08.502,00:39:10.401,"Endless longing,"
00:39:10.760,00:39:12.000,摧心肝,00:39:11.672,00:39:13.250,shatters my heart into ruins.
00:39:15.010,00:39:20.380,日色欲尽花含烟,00:39:15.884,00:39:21.480,"The sun has set, and mist settles on the flowers;"
00:39:22.060,00:39:28.020,月明如素愁不眠,00:39:22.934,00:39:29.120,The moon is white as silk on this sleepless night.
00:39:32.320,00:39:37.240,赵瑟初停凤凰柱,00:39:33.270,00:39:38.340,"I set aside my harp, its inlaid phoenixes entwined"
00:39:39.330,00:39:45.080,蜀琴欲奏鸳鸯弦,00:39:40.204,00:39:46.180,"and pick up the zither, its paired strings like coupling love birds."
00:39:47.340,00:39:53.250,此曲有意无人传,00:39:48.177,00:39:54.350,This song has a meaning that no person can convey;
00:39:55.970,00:40:01.220,愿随春风寄燕然,00:39:56.807,00:40:02.320,perhaps it can be carried to Mount Yanran on the Spring winds.
00:40:05.900,00:40:10.940,忆君迢迢隔青天,00:40:06.850,00:40:12.040,"Remembering you, separated by this deep blue sky."
00:40:13.950,00:40:17.860,昔日横波目,00:40:14.787,00:40:18.960,"My eyes, once filled with light"
00:40:19.200,00:40:22.910,今为流泪泉,00:40:20.000,00:40:24.010,now overflow with tears.
00:40:26.340,00:40:29.250,不信妾肠断,00:40:27.214,00:40:30.350,"If you do not believe my heart aches for you,"
00:40:30.800,00:40:36.630,归来看取明镜前,00:40:31.750,00:40:37.730,"come, and seek my eyes in this bright mirror."
00:40:43.600,00:40:45.060,先帝去世以后,00:40:44.512,00:40:46.320,"After the prior emperor passed away,"
00:40:46.440,00:40:47.850,很久再没有听到,00:40:47.314,00:40:49.200,it has been a long time since I heard
00:40:48.270,00:40:52.560,这长相思与长相守合奏的声音了,00:40:49.200,00:40:53.961,the duet between Endless Longing and Eternal Promise.
00:40:54.360,00:40:57.030,今日再闻到这琴笛合奏,00:40:55.234,00:40:58.356,Hearing it again today
00:40:58.490,00:41:02.700,很有当日我与先帝合奏的情味,00:40:59.402,00:41:01.238,reminded me of the time
00:41:05.830,00:41:06.950,太妃说得是,00:41:01.238,00:41:03.980,when I played together with the prior emperor.
00:41:07.710,00:41:09.290,别的琴笛便也罢了,00:41:06.704,00:41:08.238,Your Venerable Highness is right.
00:41:09.920,00:41:12.000,咱们的长相思与长相守,00:41:08.509,00:41:10.400,"Unlike ordinary zithers and flutes,"
00:41:12.220,00:41:14.460,不止考较弹奏者的功力与技巧,00:41:10.720,00:41:15.400,"playing Endless Longing and Eternal Promise
requires more than skill and experience."
00:41:14.840,00:41:17.680,还要合奏时心有灵犀彼此知晓,00:41:15.880,00:41:19.080,"The performers must be kindred spirits
who understand each other,"
00:41:18.220,00:41:19.590,才能弹出情致来,00:41:19.080,00:41:20.800,as if they harbor these emotions themselves.
00:41:19.970,00:41:22.430,要不然哪有相思相守的韵味,00:41:20.800,00:41:23.436,"Otherwise, the sense of longing and promise will be lost."
00:41:23.310,00:41:24.590,积云姑姑这番话,00:41:24.147,00:41:26.000,"What Madam Nebular just said,"
00:41:25.560,00:41:27.550,倒是叫我瞎猫碰上了死老鼠,00:41:26.400,00:41:28.800,makes me feel grateful for my blind luck.
00:41:29.190,00:41:31.730,我和王爷彼此知晓那还说得过去,00:41:30.000,00:41:33.131,"It makes sense to say His Lordship and I
are familiar with each other."
00:41:32.900,00:41:34.230,若说情致韵味,00:41:33.774,00:41:35.593,But to say that we shared emotion
00:41:35.030,00:41:36.640,那真真是贻笑大方了,00:41:35.904,00:41:37.720,would expose us to ridicule.
00:41:37.570,00:41:39.530,是我说得高兴忘了分寸了,00:41:38.294,00:41:40.818,I misspoke out of excitement.
00:41:39.870,00:41:41.280,娘子别见怪才是,00:41:40.818,00:41:42.568,"Please forgive me, Mistress."
00:41:43.000,00:41:45.240,从前只是琴笛的合奏,00:41:43.837,00:41:46.426,"In the past, it was only a duet between zither and flute."
00:41:45.540,00:41:47.330,如今还有额娘的吟唱,00:41:46.426,00:41:48.200,"Mother, with your recitation,"
00:41:48.380,00:41:51.460,当真是完美无缺了,00:41:49.254,00:41:51.301,it became ...
,,,00:41:51.902,00:41:53.270,"perfect, nothing missing."
00:41:53.840,00:41:56.580,琴笛合奏只能感受其间韵味,00:41:54.718,00:41:57.684,The music only hints at the emotions.
00:41:57.260,00:41:58.220,倒不如直接吟唱出,,,
00:41:58.590,00:41:59.630,长相思的歌词,00:41:58.172,00:42:00.960,It's better to speak the lyrics of Endless Longing out loud.
00:42:01.600,00:42:03.680,世间的情意于太妃而言,00:42:02.560,00:42:04.560,"In Your Venerable Highness's voice, we can hear that"
00:42:05.270,00:42:08.390,是直接明了胜于隐约婉转,00:42:06.240,00:42:07.827,the direct expression of love
,,,00:42:07.827,00:42:09.800,is better than implicit feelings.
00:42:10.820,00:42:13.770,甄娘子也算是我的知音了,00:42:11.619,00:42:13.080,"Mistress Zhen,"
,,,00:42:13.080,00:42:15.139,you truly understand me.

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.100,00:43:00.100,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.100,00:43:20.100,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.100,00:43:37.100,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.100,00:43:55.100,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.100,00:44:03.100,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.100,00:44:15.100,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.100,00:44:34.100,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."

shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
