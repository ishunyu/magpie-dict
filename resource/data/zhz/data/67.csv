00:09:30.440,00:09:31.730,请皇阿玛放心养病,00:09:30.500,00:09:32.725,Please take your time to recuperate and don't worry about anything.
00:09:38.360,00:09:40.700,皇上驾到,00:09:38.360,00:09:40.700,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:09:41.830,00:09:43.360,皇上金安,00:09:41.920,00:09:43.520,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:09:43.620,00:09:44.330,都起来吧,00:09:43.740,00:09:44.400,Rise.
00:09:44.790,00:09:46.150,谢皇上,00:09:44.790,00:09:46.300,I thank Your Majesty.
00:09:51.500,00:09:52.620,今儿是元宵,00:09:51.620,00:09:52.740,Today is the Lantern Festival.
00:09:53.590,00:09:55.580,朕见过了百官就过来了,00:09:53.680,00:09:55.700,I come here after meeting the court officials.
00:09:56.010,00:09:56.790,雪天路滑,00:09:55.700,00:09:57.324,The paths are slippery on a snowy day.
00:09:57.050,00:09:59.260,跟着皇上的人也该格外仔细些,00:09:57.324,00:09:59.520,Your Majesty's servants should be more careful.
00:10:01.100,00:10:02.380,朕一路过来,00:10:01.260,00:10:02.600,"Along the way here,"
00:10:02.720,00:10:05.460,见到宫里元宵节并没有铺张,00:10:02.720,00:10:05.660,I see nothing for the festival is overly luxurious.
00:10:05.810,00:10:06.800,很好 坐,00:10:05.780,00:10:07.440,Very good. Take your seats.
00:10:07.440,00:10:08.640,谢皇上,00:10:07.440,00:10:08.904,I thank Your Majesty.
00:10:09.440,00:10:10.770,太后过世才不久,00:10:09.440,00:10:11.349,It hasn't been long since the Empress Dowager departed this world.
00:10:11.060,00:10:13.020,臣妾觉得一切从简为上,00:10:11.349,00:10:13.200,I thought it would be best to keep everything simple.
00:10:13.440,00:10:14.930,也算是一点孝心吧,00:10:13.440,00:10:15.286,It also shows our filial affection.
00:10:16.240,00:10:17.320,皇后说得有理,00:10:16.320,00:10:17.560,I agree with you.
00:10:18.780,00:10:19.690,熹贵妃,00:10:18.780,00:10:20.000,"Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:10:20.570,00:10:22.780,弘瞻和灵犀睡得还好吗,00:10:20.570,00:10:22.780,have Hongyan and Lingxi been sleeping well?
00:10:23.740,00:10:25.280,早起进得香不香,00:10:23.740,00:10:25.280,Do they have a good appetite?
00:10:25.660,00:10:26.900,静和还哭吗,00:10:25.660,00:10:27.126,Does Jinghe still cry a lot?
00:10:27.620,00:10:29.410,在阿哥所一切都安好,00:10:27.620,00:10:29.636,All is going well at the Imperial Nursery.
00:10:30.000,00:10:31.540,乳母们照料得很细致,00:10:30.000,00:10:31.766,The maids take meticulous care of them.
00:10:32.250,00:10:34.290,皇上日日都要见三个孩子,00:10:32.250,00:10:34.290,"Your Majesty sees these three children every day,"
00:10:34.550,00:10:35.580,还这样放心不下,00:10:34.550,00:10:35.920,yet still gets concerned about them.
00:10:36.130,00:10:38.040,果真是慈父情怀呀,00:10:36.130,00:10:38.040,You're a very loving father!
00:10:39.010,00:10:39.870,不只皇上,00:10:39.010,00:10:40.300,"It's not only His Majesty,"
00:10:40.300,00:10:41.590,臣妾这个做额娘的,00:10:40.300,00:10:41.590,"as their mother,"
00:10:41.930,00:10:43.420,就算日日见到这几个孩子,00:10:41.930,00:10:43.420," even though I am with them daily,"
00:10:43.890,00:10:45.000,也总有操不完的心,00:10:43.890,00:10:45.310,I still have too much to worry about.
00:10:45.310,00:10:47.720,是啊 熹贵妃这样操心,00:10:45.310,00:10:48.140,"Of course, Noble Consort Lumière has to take care of so many things."
00:10:48.140,00:10:49.430,人也憔悴了许多,00:10:48.140,00:10:49.430,It makes her look less healthy.
00:10:50.270,00:10:51.890,到底还是做额娘的,00:10:50.270,00:10:51.890,"You're a mother after all,"
00:10:52.150,00:10:54.180,事事都要思虑周全,00:10:52.150,00:10:54.180,You have to take everything into serious consideration
00:10:55.440,00:10:56.930,皇后娘娘母仪天下,00:10:55.440,00:10:56.930,"Your Majesty is the ""mother of the nation."""
00:10:57.400,00:10:59.060,是天下所有臣民的母亲,00:10:57.400,00:10:59.060,You are the mother of all the citizens under Heaven.
00:10:59.700,00:11:00.780,要操心烦忧的事,,,
00:11:01.160,00:11:02.400,自然比臣妾多得多,00:10:59.700,00:11:02.511,Your Majesty has many more matters to worry about than I do.
00:11:02.990,00:11:06.860,皇后长久地不做生身母亲,00:11:02.990,00:11:06.860,The Empress has not been a birth mother for many years.
00:11:08.160,00:11:11.660,自然不记得照顾一个年幼的孩儿,00:11:08.160,00:11:11.660,"Naturally, she cannot recall how tiring and difficult it is"
00:11:12.000,00:11:13.490,是多么烦琐劳累了,00:11:12.000,00:11:13.490,to take care of young children.
00:11:18.380,00:11:20.370,好端端的为什么要行礼呀,00:11:18.380,00:11:20.370,Why are you bowing so suddenly?
00:11:21.180,00:11:22.040,恭喜皇上,00:11:21.180,00:11:22.304,"Congratulations, Your Majesty."
00:11:22.470,00:11:23.580,延禧宫的安嫔,00:11:22.470,00:11:23.580,Concubine An from the Palace of Prolonging Happiness
00:11:23.890,00:11:25.380,已有三个月的身孕了,00:11:23.890,00:11:25.380,has been pregnant for three months.
00:11:26.680,00:11:27.340,果真吗,00:11:26.680,00:11:27.604,Really?
00:11:27.930,00:11:29.300,太医已经诊过脉了,00:11:27.930,00:11:29.300,The Doctor has already taken her pulse.
00:11:29.640,00:11:30.510,千真万确,00:11:29.640,00:11:30.510,It is as true as can be.
00:11:33.480,00:11:36.770,恭喜皇上 恭喜安嫔,00:11:33.480,00:11:36.770,"Congratulations, Your Majesty!
Congratulations, Concubine An!"
00:11:37.230,00:11:38.970,快坐快坐快坐 都坐下,00:11:37.230,00:11:38.970,"Please sit down, all sit."
00:11:41.200,00:11:42.730,皇后瞒得一丝不露,00:11:41.200,00:11:43.280,"Your Majesty discreetly hid all information about this,"
00:11:43.280,00:11:45.860,单等安嫔胎像稳固之后才道出,00:11:43.280,00:11:45.860,announcing it only after Concubine An's pregnancy became stable.
00:11:46.450,00:11:47.940,还真是用心良苦啊,00:11:46.450,00:11:47.940,Your Majesty's thoughtfulness is profound.
00:11:48.580,00:11:50.190,安嫔的身子本来就弱,00:11:48.580,00:11:50.190,Concubine An has always had a fragile constitution.
00:11:51.080,00:11:52.620,以前月信紊乱,00:11:51.080,00:11:53.035,"Her ""monthly letters"" were usually irregular."
00:11:53.370,00:11:55.330,自己也是到了三个月的时候,00:11:53.370,00:11:55.330,She herself didn't know that she was pregnant
00:11:55.590,00:11:56.370,才晓得,00:11:55.590,00:11:56.860,until she was three months along.
00:11:57.050,00:11:58.380,她父亲还在狱里,00:11:57.050,00:11:58.380,Her father is still in prison.
00:11:58.710,00:11:59.830,她也不敢张扬,00:11:58.710,00:12:00.245,She doesn't dare to draw any attention.
00:12:01.550,00:12:03.840,也是本宫有意防范着,00:12:01.550,00:12:03.840,I also concealed the truth as a precaution.
00:12:04.430,00:12:07.460,以防哪个妃嫔错了主意,00:12:04.430,00:12:07.460,Just in case any concubine was overcome by jealousy
00:12:08.600,00:12:10.880,又走了当年齐妃的老路了,00:12:08.600,00:12:10.880,and went down Consort Astuce's old path.
00:12:12.520,00:12:13.600,皇后说得是,00:12:12.520,00:12:13.600,"Precisely, Your Majesty."
00:12:14.770,00:12:16.560,臣妾奉旨协理六宫,00:12:14.770,00:12:16.560,"Since I was decreed to assist in palace affairs,"
00:12:16.860,00:12:18.310,一定尽心协助皇后,00:12:16.860,00:12:18.310,I will do everything to aid Your Majesty
00:12:18.780,00:12:20.190,保全安嫔的龙胎,00:12:18.780,00:12:20.567,to protect Concubine An's imperial heir.
00:12:20.740,00:12:22.400,熹贵妃这样明白大体,00:12:20.740,00:12:22.700,Noble Consort Lumière always considers the greater good.
00:12:22.700,00:12:23.900,真是再好不过了,00:12:22.700,00:12:24.202,Nothing is more appreciated.
00:12:24.610,00:12:26.730,皇上 安嫔身子孱弱,00:12:24.610,00:12:26.730,"Your Majesty, Concubine An is frail"
00:12:27.120,00:12:29.450,又为她父亲的事情忧心不安,00:12:27.120,00:12:29.450,and deeply worried about her father at the same time.
00:12:30.370,00:12:32.990,为请龙胎稳固 也为宽慰安嫔,00:12:30.370,00:12:32.990,"For the stability of her pregnancy and to comfort her,"
00:12:33.540,00:12:35.660,臣妾请求晋安嫔为妃位,00:12:33.540,00:12:35.660,I plead with Your Majesty to promote Concubine An to Consort.
00:12:37.750,00:12:40.460,妃位原该是有四个,00:12:37.750,00:12:40.460,There can be four Consorts in the palace.
00:12:41.710,00:12:42.620,只是,00:12:41.710,00:12:42.620,However...
00:12:42.920,00:12:44.590,臣妾也是为皇嗣考虑,00:12:42.920,00:12:44.590,I am also thinking on behalf of the future heir.
00:12:45.010,00:12:47.800,若是不晋封 只怕六宫议论起来,00:12:45.010,00:12:48.180,"If she is not promoted, I'm concerned
the palace gossip will focus on"
00:12:48.180,00:12:49.970,她是为她父亲所连累,00:12:48.180,00:12:50.272,how Concubine An was negatively impacted by her father's case.
00:12:51.020,00:12:52.930,这样更叫安嫔伤心,00:12:51.020,00:12:52.930,That will make her even sadder.
00:12:53.390,00:12:54.880,如何还能安胎呢,00:12:53.390,00:12:55.069,How will she stabilize her pregnancy?
00:12:55.900,00:12:57.510,皇后心意已定也就罢了,00:12:55.900,00:12:57.510,Her Majesty is determined.
00:12:58.400,00:13:01.310,从前安嫔的封号都只是以姓为号,00:12:58.400,00:13:01.310,Concubine An's title has always been simply her family name.
00:13:02.110,00:13:04.520,如今有了身孕 身份更为贵重,00:13:02.110,00:13:04.520,"Since she now carries a future heir, her status is more distinguished."
00:13:05.320,00:13:08.530,该让内务府好好拟定封号来选,00:13:05.320,00:13:07.849,"To demonstrate sincerity and the significance of the promotion,"
00:13:08.990,00:13:10.450,才显得郑重其事啊,00:13:08.079,00:13:10.639,"the Household Department should take care
 proposing some honorary names."
00:13:11.290,00:13:14.070,就让内务府去办吧 熹贵妃有心了,00:13:11.290,00:13:14.636,"That is very thoughtful of you, Noble Consort Lumière.
We will have the Imperial Household Department do it."
00:13:14.960,00:13:16.620,如今六宫妃位多悬,00:13:14.960,00:13:17.035,Many ranks are not occupied currently for Consort and above.
00:13:17.330,00:13:20.540,妃位上能够四角齐全也是好事,00:13:17.330,00:13:20.540,It's a blessing to fulfill the number at the Consort level.
00:13:33.980,00:13:35.220,娘娘不大舒服啊,00:13:33.980,00:13:35.520,Is Your Highness feeling unwell?
00:13:38.480,00:13:40.090,安陵容怎么会有身孕,00:13:38.480,00:13:40.165,How could An Lingrong become pregnant?
00:13:40.940,00:13:41.730,是啊,00:13:40.940,00:13:41.843,Indeed...
00:13:42.610,00:13:43.970,她不是用过息肌丸吗,00:13:42.610,00:13:43.970,Didn't she already use the Flesh Thinning Pills?
00:13:44.280,00:13:45.440,怎么会有身孕呢,00:13:44.280,00:13:45.742,How could she be pregnant?
00:13:46.030,00:13:47.640,这东西虽然伤身子,00:13:46.030,00:13:47.942,"Although the pills were harmful to her body,"
00:13:48.410,00:13:49.820,但也未必会绝育啊,00:13:48.410,00:13:50.000,it doesn't mean she was made infertile.
00:13:50.410,00:13:52.020,这下皇后可又精神了,00:13:50.410,00:13:52.020,This has lifted the Empress's spirits.
00:13:54.910,00:13:56.120,今日皇后再次提起,,,
00:13:56.410,00:13:58.280,安陵容的父亲与安胎一事,00:13:54.910,00:13:58.400,"Today the Empress once again mentioned
An Lingrong's father's case and her prenatal care."
00:13:59.420,00:14:00.530,为保皇嗣,00:13:59.420,00:14:01.134,"In order to protect the imperial heir,"
00:14:02.170,00:14:02.660,只怕不日,,,
00:14:02.920,00:14:05.410,便会把安比槐受贿一事一笔勾销,00:14:02.327,00:14:05.600,An Bihuai's bribe-taking records might soon be erased.
00:14:07.510,00:14:09.500,万一安陵容要生下个皇子,00:14:07.635,00:14:09.500,"If An Lingrong gives birth to a prince,"
00:14:10.140,00:14:12.050,那皇后手中就有两个皇子,00:14:10.140,00:14:12.050,then the Empress will have two sons in her palm.
00:14:14.020,00:14:15.930,无论哪一个被立为太子,00:14:14.020,00:14:16.345,"No matter which one is established as the Crown Prince,"
00:14:18.390,00:14:20.130,那咱们以后的处境,00:14:18.390,00:14:20.130,our situation in the palace will....
00:14:29.450,00:14:30.900,皇上万福金安,00:14:29.450,00:14:30.900,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:14:32.370,00:14:33.780,你怎么过来了 起来吧,00:14:32.370,00:14:33.780,What brings you here? Rise.
00:14:35.790,00:14:37.650,果然是人逢喜事精神爽,00:14:35.790,00:14:38.290,"Indeed ""a blithe heart makes a blooming visage!"""
00:14:38.290,00:14:39.830,看皇上神气红润,00:14:38.290,00:14:39.830,I can easily tell
00:14:40.630,00:14:42.040,就知道安妹妹的身孕,,,
00:14:42.380,00:14:43.830,有多让皇上高兴了,00:14:40.630,00:14:43.889,"how much joy Lingrong's pregnancy brings to Your Majesty
from Your Majesty's glowing appearance."
00:14:44.800,00:14:46.830,一向看着容儿身子娇弱,00:14:44.800,00:14:46.830,I always knew Lingrong had a delicate constitution.
00:14:47.170,00:14:49.160,没想到胎像倒十分安稳,00:14:47.170,00:14:49.160,"But surprisingly, her pregnancy is quite stable."
00:14:49.930,00:14:52.540,可见安妹妹的孩子有多贴心,00:14:49.930,00:14:52.540,That shows how caring the baby is -
00:14:53.470,00:14:55.510,将来必定十分孝顺懂事,00:14:53.470,00:14:55.812,he will be so filial and sensible when he grows up.
00:14:56.770,00:14:57.630,你来得正好,00:14:56.770,00:14:58.234,"You came at a good time,"
00:14:58.520,00:15:00.510,朕一个人看书正乏味呢,00:14:58.520,00:15:00.510,I was quite bored reading by myself.
00:15:01.560,00:15:02.430,臣妾想,00:15:01.560,00:15:02.430,I was thinking
00:15:02.980,00:15:04.810,皇上为安妹妹的事高兴,00:15:02.980,00:15:05.150,Your Majesty must've had a really good appetite at lunch
00:15:05.150,00:15:07.730,这午誊一定是敞开了胃口吃的,00:15:05.150,00:15:07.730,from the joy over Lingrong's pregnancy.
00:15:08.440,00:15:11.150,这时候定会觉得腻腻的不消化,00:15:08.440,00:15:11.150,"If so, Your Majesty's stomach must feel overly full now,"
00:15:11.950,00:15:15.360,所以臣妾特带了一份点心,00:15:11.950,00:15:15.360,so I brought special desserts for Your Majesty.
00:15:16.660,00:15:18.820,给皇上享用 不知可好,00:15:16.660,00:15:18.820,What does Your Majesty think？
00:15:19.460,00:15:21.120,咱们心有灵犀呀,00:15:19.460,00:15:21.460,"Our hearts are connected by the ""divine rhino's horn""."
00:15:22.130,00:15:24.410,这莲叶羹,00:15:22.308,00:15:26.077,This lotus soup is made from fresh young lotus leaves
00:15:25.130,00:15:28.000,是取新鲜的嫩莲叶在日出前摘下,00:15:26.644,00:15:28.000,picked before sunrise.
00:15:28.670,00:15:30.910,熬汤的水都是莲叶上的露珠,00:15:28.670,00:15:30.910,The water for the soup was taken from dewdrops on the lotus leaves.
00:15:31.590,00:15:32.920,都是去年收起来的,00:15:31.590,00:15:32.920,It was collected last year.
00:15:33.930,00:15:36.390,藕粉桂花糖糕入口香甜,00:15:33.930,00:15:36.390,The lotus osmanthus cakes are fragrant and sweet.
00:15:36.890,00:15:37.630,皇上尝尝,00:15:36.890,00:15:38.460,May Your Majesty try some.
00:15:41.520,00:15:43.310,以前眉庄宫里的这个,00:15:41.520,00:15:43.310,I remember that
00:15:43.860,00:15:46.560,藕粉桂花糖糕做得最好,00:15:43.860,00:15:46.824,Meizhuang used to make the most delicious lotus osmanthus cakes.
00:15:49.070,00:15:50.400,皇上想着姐姐,00:15:49.070,00:15:50.815,Enjoying the cakes is reminding
00:15:50.990,00:15:51.820,吃着喜欢,00:15:50.990,00:15:52.530,Your Majesty of Meizhuang.
00:15:52.530,00:15:53.770,便是怀念姐姐了,00:15:52.530,00:15:54.070,Your Majesty must miss her.
00:15:58.330,00:15:59.360,给皇上请安,00:15:58.330,00:15:59.360,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:16:00.370,00:16:01.660,给熹贵妃请安,00:16:00.370,00:16:01.660,Peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:16:02.500,00:16:03.280,什么事,00:16:02.500,00:16:03.544,What is it?
00:16:04.250,00:16:04.990,回皇上话,00:16:04.250,00:16:05.443,"Your Majesty,"
00:16:05.750,00:16:08.290,内务府拟好了给安嫔的封号,00:16:05.750,00:16:08.290,the Household Department proposed several honorary names for Concubine An
00:16:08.750,00:16:09.740,请皇上过目,00:16:08.750,00:16:09.740,for Your Majesty's review.
00:16:12.380,00:16:13.710,你来帮朕看看吧,00:16:12.380,00:16:13.710,Why don't you help review them?
00:16:16.890,00:16:18.380,字的意思倒还都好,00:16:16.890,00:16:18.606,All three words have a good meaning.
00:16:19.470,00:16:20.550,这个肃字,00:16:19.470,00:16:21.060,The Sù character
00:16:21.060,00:16:22.510,刚德克就曰肃,00:16:21.060,00:16:22.887,"can mean one is virtuous and principled,"
00:16:23.270,00:16:24.850,貌恭心敬曰肃,00:16:23.270,00:16:24.850,as well as dutiful and deferential.
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.470,倒是这个文字,00:16:26.360,00:16:27.885,"But in my opinion, the Wén character"
00:16:28.400,00:16:30.520,好像更对安妹妹的性子,00:16:28.400,00:16:30.520,is more suitable for Lingrong's temperament.
00:16:30.990,00:16:33.900,容儿静默谦顺 乃礼义人也,00:16:30.990,00:16:34.094,"Lingrong is soft-spoken and humble.
She is indeed a courteous person."
00:16:34.320,00:16:36.610,这个文字的确更贴切,00:16:34.320,00:16:36.610,The Wén character is more appropriate.
00:16:36.870,00:16:39.820,文这一字可以说是文静有礼,00:16:36.870,00:16:39.820,"Although Wén can be interpreted as ""gentle and well-mannered"","
00:16:40.830,00:16:41.990,但更多的时候,00:16:40.830,00:16:42.290,"more often than not,"
00:16:42.290,00:16:44.750,是形容一个人腹有诗书气自华,00:16:42.290,00:16:44.750,it describes someone who is well-read and cultured.
00:16:45.330,00:16:46.410,若选了这个字,00:16:45.330,00:16:46.691,"If this character is selected,"
00:16:46.880,00:16:48.410,只怕安妹妹会多心了,00:16:46.880,00:16:48.410,Lingrong might overthink.
00:16:48.960,00:16:50.500,那便只剩个俪字了,00:16:48.960,00:16:50.764,That leaves us with the character Lì.
00:16:51.260,00:16:52.120,俪字,00:16:51.260,00:16:52.309,Lì means
00:16:53.050,00:16:54.130,容颜姣好,00:16:53.050,00:16:54.432,"a beautiful appearance,"
00:16:54.930,00:16:56.510,是成双成对的美意,00:16:54.930,00:16:56.699,"and it implies a twosome or pair,"
00:16:57.930,00:16:59.470,又可指伉俪情深,00:16:57.100,00:16:59.930,because the word Kàng Lì refers to a loving husband and wife.
00:16:59.930,00:17:00.890,果然是极好的,00:16:59.930,00:17:00.890,This is the best.
00:17:11.820,00:17:13.980,怎么了皇上 这字不好吗,00:17:11.820,00:17:13.980,"Your Majesty, is there something wrong?"
00:17:15.820,00:17:17.690,安嫔是朕的妾侍,00:17:15.820,00:17:17.690,Concubine An is only my concubine.
00:17:18.740,00:17:21.230,怎么能跟朕夫妻伉俪呢,00:17:18.740,00:17:21.230,How can she be considered my wife?
00:17:21.870,00:17:24.110,如果朕真的用了这个字封她,00:17:21.870,00:17:24.110,"If I choose to give her this name,"
00:17:25.000,00:17:28.410,传出去文武百官又要议论纷纷,00:17:25.000,00:17:28.410,"the officials will have a lot to criticize,"
00:17:29.130,00:17:31.240,说朕太过宠幸妾侍,00:17:29.130,00:17:31.240,saying I overly favor this concubine.
00:17:33.380,00:17:34.040,苏培盛,00:17:33.380,00:17:34.040,Su Peisheng.
00:17:34.720,00:17:35.200,奴才在,00:17:34.720,00:17:35.420,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:17:35.420,00:17:36.160,传旨下去,00:17:35.420,00:17:36.430,Inform the Household Department
00:17:36.430,00:17:38.090,告诉内务府这几个字都不好,00:17:36.430,00:17:38.090,that these characters are not befitting.
00:17:38.340,00:17:39.170,让他们重新选来,00:17:38.340,00:17:39.430,They need to select new ones.
00:17:39.430,00:17:39.960,嘛,00:17:39.430,00:17:40.000,Yes.
00:17:40.180,00:17:41.640,其实何必麻烦内务府,00:17:40.000,00:17:41.640,"Actually, why trouble the Household Department again?"
00:17:42.180,00:17:43.970,皇上指一个字给妹妹做封号,00:17:42.180,00:17:44.159,"If Your Majesty assigns a name for Lingrong,"
00:17:44.350,00:17:45.430,那是再好不过的了,00:17:44.350,00:17:45.430,that would be the best.
00:17:45.730,00:17:47.470,一时间朕还真想不起来,00:17:45.730,00:17:47.470,"I can't think of a name right now,"
00:17:48.060,00:17:50.180,不如你帮朕想一个,00:17:48.060,00:17:50.180,how about you think of one for me?
00:17:50.860,00:17:53.220,这样的事臣妾怎么做主啊,00:17:50.860,00:17:53.220,How am I qualified to make such a decision?
00:17:53.780,00:17:56.810,这样你写 写出来朕看,00:17:53.780,00:17:56.810,"Here, you can write first and I'll have a look."
00:17:57.150,00:17:58.610,不合适的朕再帮你改,00:17:57.150,00:17:58.610,"If it isn't suitable, I'll change it."
00:18:24.270,00:18:25.970,皇上看 可好,00:18:24.270,00:18:25.970,"Your Majesty, what do you think?"
00:18:27.810,00:18:28.600,鹏,00:18:27.810,00:18:28.864,Lí [oriole].
00:18:29.940,00:18:30.970,能歌善舞,00:18:30.000,00:18:31.332,"Adept at singing and dancing,"
00:18:31.770,00:18:33.890,1生情又像黄鹏一样和顺,00:18:31.770,00:18:33.890,with a gentle disposition like an oriole.
00:18:34.780,00:18:37.610,而且黄鹏又是两情谴绪的鸟儿,00:18:34.780,00:18:37.610,"Besides, orioles are birds of lasting affection."
00:18:37.860,00:18:40.570,皇上 奴才听说黄鹏多子,00:18:37.860,00:18:40.570,"Your Majesty, I heard that orioles are very prolific."
00:18:41.490,00:18:43.530,正如安嫔如今怀了孕,00:18:41.490,00:18:43.530,Now that Concubine An is with child -
00:18:44.080,00:18:45.660,这不是多子多福吗,00:18:44.080,00:18:46.015,"""The more children, the more happiness."""
,,,00:18:46.015,00:18:46.918,Hmm.
00:18:47.540,00:18:49.200,这样说来的确不错,00:18:47.584,00:18:49.200,"In this way, it is a good name."
00:18:50.040,00:18:52.500,苏培盛 去传旨吧,00:18:50.040,00:18:52.500,"Su Peisheng, announce the decree"
00:18:52.790,00:18:54.700,再请皇后择个吉期,00:18:52.790,00:18:54.700,and request that the Empress choose an auspicious date.
00:18:54.960,00:18:55.540,嘛,00:18:54.960,00:18:55.540,Aye.
00:19:00.340,00:19:01.920,师傅 今儿个怎么了,00:19:00.340,00:19:01.920,"Master, what happened today?"
00:19:02.090,00:19:02.710,这么高兴,00:19:02.090,00:19:02.899,You look so happy.
00:19:03.800,00:19:05.760,安嫔娘娘得了个好封号,00:19:03.800,00:19:05.760,Concubine An received a good title.
00:19:06.020,00:19:06.850,怎么不高兴啊,00:19:06.020,00:19:06.963,How can I not be happy?
00:19:08.680,00:19:11.140,去跟雀鸟司说 要五十只黄鹏鸟,00:19:08.680,00:19:11.140,Request fifty orioles from the Imperial Aviary.
00:19:11.480,00:19:13.390,咱们去给安嫔娘娘贺喜,00:19:11.480,00:19:13.390,Let's go congratulate Concubine An.
00:19:13.690,00:19:14.140,嘛,00:19:13.690,00:19:14.190,Aye.
00:19:18.110,00:19:20.400,想什么呢 这样出神,00:19:18.110,00:19:20.400,"What are you thinking about, so absorbed?"
00:19:23.030,00:19:24.440,今日安妹妹大喜,00:19:23.030,00:19:24.893,This great day of rejoicing for Lingrong
00:19:25.330,00:19:28.940,倒叫臣妾想起来当年入宫的情景,00:19:25.330,00:19:28.940,reminded me of how we entered the harem together.
00:19:30.620,00:19:32.710,臣妾与安妹妹还有眉姐姐,00:19:30.620,00:19:32.710,"Lingrong, Meizhuang, and I"
00:19:33.790,00:19:34.700,是同日入宫,00:19:33.790,00:19:35.560,entered the palace on the same day.
00:19:35.670,00:19:37.000,又一直情同姐妹,00:19:35.670,00:19:37.000,We've always been like sisters.
00:19:40.380,00:19:44.220,眉庄在的时候朕没有好好待她,00:19:40.380,00:19:45.160,I didn't treat Meizhuang well when she was alive.
00:19:45.430,00:19:48.840,现在想起来心里不安哪,00:19:45.430,00:19:49.195,"Looking back, it disturbs my heart."
00:19:50.100,00:19:53.060,如今臣妾已经位列贵妃,00:19:50.100,00:19:53.060,"Now, I already rank at Noble Consort"
00:19:54.400,00:19:55.760,安妹妹也封了鹏妃,00:19:54.400,00:19:56.213,and Lingrong is titled Consort Oriole.
00:19:57.070,00:19:58.650,眉姐姐虽也封了惠妃,00:19:57.070,00:19:58.990,"Although Meizhuang was promoted to Consort Vertu,"
00:19:59.610,00:20:01.320,但谧字追尊还未定,00:19:59.610,00:20:01.622,her posthumous name still remains undecided.
00:20:05.370,00:20:08.230,臣妾想求一求皇上的恩典,00:20:05.370,00:20:08.230,I wish to ask for Your Majesty's grace:
00:20:09.160,00:20:10.780,再赐眉姐姐一份哀荣吧,00:20:09.160,00:20:11.120,please grant Meizhuang a posthumous honor.
00:20:11.460,00:20:12.410,逝者已逝,00:20:11.460,00:20:12.938,The dead have passed on.
00:20:13.500,00:20:16.080,生者也不能为他们多做些什么,00:20:13.500,00:20:16.080,There are not many things the living can do for them.
00:20:16.710,00:20:19.790,那就依你所言 以表追思吧,00:20:16.710,00:20:19.790,I will do as you suggest to convey our reminiscence.
00:20:20.800,00:20:24.040,皇后病着 这事就交由你处理,00:20:20.800,00:20:24.040,The Empress is unwell. I will entrust this to you.
00:20:24.430,00:20:26.630,是 既然说了,00:20:24.430,00:20:25.472,Yes.
,,,00:20:25.774,00:20:27.300,"Since we speak of this matter,"
00:20:27.300,00:20:29.890,那臣妾就斗胆再求一份恩典,00:20:27.300,00:20:29.890,I'm boldly taking the liberty of asking for another favor.
00:20:31.060,00:20:32.760,齐妃是畏罪自戕,00:20:31.060,00:20:33.190,Consort Astuce committed suicide to escape punishment.
00:20:33.190,00:20:34.640,依例是不能追封的,00:20:33.190,00:20:34.942,"Customarily, she cannot be conferred a title posthumously."
00:20:35.520,00:20:36.890,但三阿哥渐渐大了,00:20:35.520,00:20:37.154,"But as the Third Prince grows up,"
00:20:37.570,00:20:38.770,也得顾及他的颜面,00:20:37.570,00:20:39.110,his prestige should be considered.
00:20:39.570,00:20:42.150,既如此 那些已故的妃嫔,00:20:39.570,00:20:43.440,"In this case, I will confer honor on all the late concubines."
00:20:42.490,00:20:43.440,就一起追封了吧,,,
00:20:44.280,00:20:46.650,年羹尧与隆科多都已伏法,00:20:44.280,00:20:46.650,Nian Gengyao and Longkodo were executed.
00:20:47.320,00:20:49.940,朕也不想落个苛待后宫的名声,00:20:47.320,00:20:50.080,I don't want people to say that I am also harsh to my concubines.
00:20:50.870,00:20:54.080,就封华贵妃为皇贵妃吧,00:20:50.870,00:20:54.080,Noble Consort Fleur is honored as Imperial Noble Consort.
00:20:54.830,00:20:58.540,也算是尽朕的一份哀思,00:20:54.830,00:20:58.540,This will be an expression of my sorrowfulness.
00:21:00.710,00:21:01.870,说起追封一事,00:21:00.710,00:21:01.870,"Speaking of honors,"
00:21:02.880,00:21:05.670,倒叫臣妾想起了今日,00:21:02.880,00:21:05.670,I remember what Her Majesty said today
00:21:05.970,00:21:07.670,皇后在景仁宫说的一句话,00:21:05.970,00:21:07.670,in The Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:21:10.180,00:21:11.300,皇后娘娘说,00:21:10.180,00:21:11.602,Her Majesty said
00:21:12.020,00:21:13.260,六宫妃位多悬,00:21:12.020,00:21:13.939,many of the harem ranks are not currently occupied.
00:21:14.270,00:21:15.630,臣妾也是这样想的,00:21:14.270,00:21:15.932,I have thought the same thing.
00:21:16.520,00:21:18.890,宫中不乏比臣妾资历深厚,00:21:16.520,00:21:20.320,"The harem has no lack of concubines
 more senior and more virtuous than me."
00:21:19.150,00:21:20.350,德行贵重的嫔妃,,,
00:21:21.780,00:21:24.730,臣妾忝居高位 常常自觉不安,00:21:21.780,00:21:24.730,"I often feel self-conscious and uneasy
sitting in such a high rank."
00:21:25.360,00:21:27.070,说起来六宫之中,,,
00:21:27.360,00:21:29.320,也是许久没有大封过一次了,00:21:25.360,00:21:29.320,"Now that you mention it, the harem hasn't had
an extensive promotion for a long time."
00:21:30.080,00:21:31.910,皇后不提 朕都疏忽了,00:21:30.080,00:21:32.250,I'd have almost forgotten it if the Empress didn't mention it.
00:21:32.580,00:21:33.740,臣妾也是这样想,00:21:32.580,00:21:33.740,I think so too.
00:21:34.790,00:21:36.400,已故者可以放一放,00:21:34.790,00:21:36.664,The late concubines are not the highest priority.
00:21:37.170,00:21:39.030,倒是宫里朝夕相处的姐妹,00:21:37.170,00:21:41.040,"However, the concubines we face day to day
should be granted their due promotions."
00:21:39.500,00:21:41.040,该好好晋一晋位分了,,,
00:21:41.670,00:21:42.580,后宫和睦,00:21:41.670,00:21:43.200,A harmonious harem is conducive
00:21:43.210,00:21:45.330,对皇上的前朝也是有所助益的,00:21:43.210,00:21:45.330,to Your Majesty in the imperial court.
00:21:46.380,00:21:47.790,臣妾只求皇上一样,00:21:46.380,00:21:47.790,I only have one request:
00:21:48.970,00:21:50.960,无论如何加封宫中各位姐妹,00:21:48.970,00:21:51.224,"No matter how Your Majesty promotes the concubines,"
00:21:51.430,00:21:54.340,只请皇上一定要以端妃姐姐为尊,00:21:51.430,00:21:54.340,please grant Consort Honnête the highest honor
00:21:55.020,00:21:56.180,居于臣妾之上,00:21:55.020,00:21:56.180,and place her above me.
00:21:56.810,00:21:58.800,否则臣妾终究难安,00:21:56.810,00:21:58.800,"Otherwise, I will always feel uneasy."
00:21:59.400,00:22:00.850,端妃进宫最久,00:21:59.400,00:22:01.320,"Consort Honnête was the first to enter the harem,"
00:22:01.320,00:22:03.400,皇贵妃这个位子本也当得,00:22:01.320,00:22:03.777,she is worthy of the title of Imperial Noble Consort.
00:22:04.280,00:22:08.740,只是朕心里总是更属意于你,00:22:04.280,00:22:08.740,"However, I am of the mind that this title belongs to you."
00:22:10.700,00:22:13.490,皇上心里有臣妾 臣妾心里明白,00:22:10.700,00:22:13.490,I understand that Your Majesty has me in your heart.
00:22:14.200,00:22:15.490,不愿在名位上计较,00:22:14.200,00:22:15.490,I don't mind any rank and title.
00:22:17.080,00:22:20.870,既如此 那朕就册封端妃为皇贵妃,00:22:17.080,00:22:20.870,"If so, Consort Honnête is promoted to Imperial Noble Consort."
00:22:21.710,00:22:24.250,朕早些年很委屈了敬妃,00:22:21.710,00:22:24.480,I also let Consort Estime suffer a lot in the earlier years.
00:22:24.960,00:22:26.330,她又素性温和,00:22:24.960,00:22:26.630,She's mild-tempered and gentle.
00:22:26.630,00:22:29.840,就册为贵妃 与你并尊吧,00:22:26.630,00:22:29.840,I will promote her to Noble Consort - the same rank as yours.
00:22:30.340,00:22:33.710,另外 欣贵人也是伺候朕多年,00:22:30.340,00:22:33.710,"And, Noble Lady Joie has been serving me for many years."
00:22:34.390,00:22:36.550,就册为欣嫔吧,00:22:34.390,00:22:36.550,She is promoted to Concubine Joie.
00:22:37.600,00:22:38.890,皇上思虑周全,00:22:37.600,00:22:39.520,Your Majesty is considerate of everyone.
00:22:39.520,00:22:42.310,臣妾是万万想不了那么多了,00:22:39.520,00:22:42.310,I could never be mindful of so many things.
00:22:42.730,00:22:44.600,你哪里是想得不周全,00:22:42.730,00:22:44.751,You're not inconsiderate -
00:22:45.570,00:22:48.180,不过是等着朕开口罢了,00:22:45.570,00:22:48.406,you were just waiting for me to open my mouth.
00:22:50.160,00:22:51.820,你为别人求了这么多,00:22:50.160,00:22:52.084,"You've made so many requests for others,"
00:22:53.080,00:22:54.530,又为别人谢了恩,,,
00:22:56.080,00:22:59.870,自己怎么不求一点恩典哪,00:22:56.080,00:22:59.870,Why not ask for something for yourself?
00:23:04.380,00:23:06.080,臣妾有皇上的宠爱,00:23:04.380,00:23:06.080,I am favored by Your Majesty.
00:23:06.590,00:23:07.800,便是最大的恩典,00:23:06.590,00:23:08.064,That is the greatest grace.
00:23:09.170,00:23:10.080,别无所求,00:23:09.170,00:23:10.457,I don't need anything else.
00:23:11.470,00:23:13.050,这熹贵妃的意思,00:23:11.470,00:23:13.050,Noble Consort Lumiere wants
00:23:13.470,00:23:15.460,是让咱们和礼部商议着,00:23:13.470,00:23:15.460,the Ministry of Rites and our department to
00:23:15.720,00:23:17.550,安排大封六宫的典礼,00:23:15.720,00:23:17.550,arrange the ceremony for the harem's grand promotions.
00:23:17.930,00:23:19.420,这些个日子当差,00:23:17.930,00:23:19.684,"Over the coming days,"
00:23:20.140,00:23:21.880,你们要打起十二分的精神,00:23:20.140,00:23:22.295,you need to be doubly careful in your duties.
00:23:22.650,00:23:24.810,这可是宫里头的大喜事,00:23:22.650,00:23:24.810,This is a grand celebration in the palace.
00:23:25.230,00:23:26.470,别出什么乱子,00:23:25.230,00:23:26.470,Don't do anything wrong.
00:23:26.690,00:23:27.520,嘛,00:23:26.690,00:23:27.520,Aye.
00:23:28.320,00:23:30.110,看见册封的单子了没,00:23:28.320,00:23:30.110,Have you seen the list of the promoted concubines?
00:23:31.110,00:23:31.980,这以后啊,00:23:31.110,00:23:31.980,"Moving forward,"
00:23:32.360,00:23:33.650,后宫谁说了算,,,
00:23:34.120,00:23:35.570,你们都得警醒着点,00:23:32.360,00:23:35.640,you need to be aware of whose words count in the harem now.
00:23:36.540,00:23:37.490,我告诉你们,00:23:36.540,00:23:37.716,"I'm telling you,"
00:23:37.910,00:23:39.450,这永寿宫的差事,,,
00:23:39.710,00:23:41.450,就是第一要紧的差事,00:23:37.910,00:23:41.440,any task for the Palace of Eternal Longevity is the number one priority.
00:23:42.040,00:23:44.200,多谢总管提点,00:23:42.040,00:23:44.200,"Thank you, sir, for your instructions."
00:23:47.250,00:23:47.870,还有,00:23:47.250,00:23:48.172,"Now then,"
00:23:48.380,00:23:50.250,给安嫔定封号的差事,00:23:48.380,00:23:51.920,who undertook the job to propose an honorary name for Concubine An?
00:23:50.760,00:23:51.920,是你们谁去办的呀,,,
00:23:52.300,00:23:53.460,是奴才 是奴才,00:23:52.300,00:23:53.460,"- It was me.
- It was me."
00:23:53.680,00:23:54.920,你们想要巴结,00:23:53.680,00:23:55.200,"You want to curry favor,"
00:23:55.550,00:23:57.840,也得知道自己巴结的是谁,00:23:55.550,00:23:57.840,but you need to know who you're fawning on
00:23:58.350,00:23:59.630,该不该巴结,00:23:58.350,00:23:59.819,and whether you should do so.
00:24:01.230,00:24:01.970,来人,00:24:01.230,00:24:02.240,These two!
00:24:02.940,00:24:04.930,拖出去打四十大棍,00:24:02.940,00:24:05.232,Will be pulled outside and flogged forty times each.
00:24:05.440,00:24:07.050,扔进慎刑司服役去吧,00:24:05.440,00:24:07.050,Then throw them into the Department of Penalty.
00:24:07.480,00:24:08.310,嘛 奴才冤枉啊,00:24:07.480,00:24:08.940,"- Aye.

00:24:12.660,00:24:15.490,这安嫔哪 封了鹏妃,00:24:12.660,00:24:15.490,Concubine An is now titled Consort Oriole.
00:24:16.280,00:24:17.690,眼瞧着是得宠,00:24:16.280,00:24:18.180,It seems that she's gaining favor.
00:24:18.490,00:24:20.490,可你们要是瞎巴结,00:24:18.490,00:24:20.490,"But if you curry favor blindly,"
00:24:20.960,00:24:23.160,得罪了人自己个儿都不知道,00:24:20.960,00:24:23.160,you may offend others without knowing.
00:24:23.960,00:24:25.700,那就活该被打死,00:24:23.960,00:24:25.920,Then you deserve to be flogged to death.
00:24:26.090,00:24:27.070,嘛,00:24:26.090,00:24:27.070,Aye.
00:24:30.920,00:24:32.210,小主不能不高兴啊,00:24:30.920,00:24:32.480,"My Lady, you have to cheer up."
00:24:32.550,00:24:34.040,得看腹中的皇子呢,00:24:32.550,00:24:34.040,Please consider the prince in your belly.
00:24:35.340,00:24:36.550,虽说是封妃,00:24:35.340,00:24:36.927,"Although I have been promoted to Consort,"
00:24:37.680,00:24:38.760,封的什么号,00:24:37.680,00:24:39.213,why am I named after a bird?
00:24:39.770,00:24:41.510,内务府的人给我选了几个封号,00:24:39.770,00:24:42.880,Why were the eunuchs who drafted the titles flogged?
00:24:41.930,00:24:42.890,怎么就挨了打了呢,,,
00:24:43.350,00:24:45.260,怎么就被打发到慎刑司去了呢,00:24:43.350,00:24:45.280,Why were they sent to the Department of Justice?
00:24:45.770,00:24:47.640,许是他们做别的事不好吧,00:24:45.770,00:24:47.640,Maybe they performed other tasks improperly.
00:24:48.520,00:24:49.560,还能有什么事,00:24:48.520,00:24:50.000,What else can it be?
00:24:50.530,00:24:51.890,还不都是为着我的事,00:24:50.530,00:24:52.192,It was only because of me!
00:24:53.280,00:24:54.940,他们给我选了几个好听的封号,00:24:53.280,00:24:56.080,They chose several good titles for me and then were flogged.
00:24:55.280,00:24:56.110,就挨了打了,,,
00:24:56.990,00:24:59.200,这不是满宫里告诉不许对我好吗,00:24:56.990,00:24:59.540,Doesn't that tell the whole harem to treat me poorly?
00:24:59.540,00:25:00.270,谁敢呢,00:24:59.540,00:25:00.496,Who dares?
00:25:00.700,00:25:01.780,小主怀着龙胎,00:25:00.700,00:25:02.195,"My Lady, you're pregnant with an imperial heir."
00:25:02.370,00:25:04.610,内务府不照样把好吃好喝的送来,00:25:02.370,00:25:04.610,The Household Department delivers all the best supplies to you.
00:25:05.080,00:25:07.120,不是最好的 他们还不敢呢,00:25:05.080,00:25:07.120,They wouldn't dare to send anything that's not the best.
00:25:08.880,00:25:10.120,我何尝不知道,00:25:08.880,00:25:10.120,I'm not unaware.
00:25:10.960,00:25:12.540,还不是为着我这个肚子,00:25:10.960,00:25:13.348,It is only because of my pregnancy.
00:25:14.550,00:25:16.040,倘若没了这个孩子,00:25:14.550,00:25:16.040,If I lose this child....
00:25:16.300,00:25:17.170,小主不许胡说,00:25:16.300,00:25:17.660,"My Lady, you mustn't say that."
00:25:20.720,00:25:23.340,外头什么声音 叫得我头疼,00:25:20.720,00:25:23.340,What's the noise outside? It's giving me a headache!
00:25:23.770,00:25:24.930,赶出去 都给我赶出去,00:25:23.770,00:25:24.930,"Get them out!

00:25:30.320,00:25:31.400,苏公公的意思,,,
00:25:32.070,00:25:33.600,许就是皇上的意思,00:25:30.320,00:25:33.531,Mr. Su probably did it on behalf of His Majesty.
00:25:34.110,00:25:35.480,小主 您可不能让皇上以为,,,
00:25:35.820,00:25:37.400,您不喜欢他给您定的封号啊,00:25:34.110,00:25:37.480,"My Lady, you can't make His Majesty think
you dislike the title he granted."
00:25:37.610,00:25:39.350,赶出去 都给我赶出去,00:25:37.610,00:25:39.350,Get them out! Get them all out!

00:25:58.140,00:26:00.090,这是打哪儿飞来的黄鹏鸟啊,00:25:58.140,00:26:00.090,Where are all these orioles from?
00:26:00.850,00:26:01.630,还能是哪儿,00:26:00.850,00:26:01.894,Where else could it be?
00:26:02.060,00:26:03.760,多半是鹏妃宫里飞出来的,00:26:02.060,00:26:03.760,Most likely from Consort Oriole's palace.
00:26:04.770,00:26:06.100,本宫台举她了,00:26:04.770,00:26:06.100,I lifted her too high.
00:26:07.060,00:26:08.180,就是要让她知道,00:26:07.060,00:26:08.331,She must be aware that
00:26:08.850,00:26:11.350,即使台举了妃位 她也根本不配,00:26:08.850,00:26:11.350,"despite her higher rank, she doesn't deserve it."
00:26:11.900,00:26:12.810,她是不配,00:26:11.900,00:26:12.810,She doesn't indeed.
00:26:13.280,00:26:15.730,还敢说内务府定的封号好,00:26:13.280,00:26:15.730,She dared to praise the titles proposed by the Household Department.
00:26:16.400,00:26:18.140,欐字是皇后可用的,00:26:16.400,00:26:18.366,"The character Lì can only be used by the Empress,"
00:26:18.700,00:26:20.560,显示与皇上伉俪情深,00:26:18.700,00:26:20.560,to show deep conjugal love with the Emperor.
00:26:21.240,00:26:23.570,鹏妃没读过几本书还敢这样讲,00:26:21.240,00:26:23.882,"Consort Oriole is not well-read; yet dares
to comment on a character she doesn't understand."
00:26:24.410,00:26:27.240,大封六宫 甄环占尽了便宜,00:26:24.410,00:26:27.240,Zhen Huan is taking all the benefits from the harem-wide promotions.
00:26:27.710,00:26:29.320,且让她得意几天吧,00:26:27.710,00:26:29.320,Let her feel smug for a few days.
00:26:29.790,00:26:30.580,娘娘圣明,00:26:29.790,00:26:30.882,Your Majesty is wise.
00:26:31.960,00:26:34.120,太医有没有按时送安胎药去,00:26:31.960,00:26:34.380,Did the doctors send the prenatal tonics on time?
00:26:34.380,00:26:35.490,按照娘娘的盼咐,00:26:34.380,00:26:35.641,"Per Your Majesty's order,"
00:26:35.840,00:26:37.050,都是最好的安胎药,00:26:35.840,00:26:37.050,only the best tonics.
00:26:37.880,00:26:39.000,昨夜太医来报,00:26:37.880,00:26:39.415,"Last night, the doctors reported that"
00:26:39.590,00:26:41.210,为了稳定鹏妃的胎气,00:26:39.590,00:26:41.210,"to stabilize Consort Oriole's prenatal qi,"
00:26:41.640,00:26:42.670,已经在烧艾了,00:26:41.640,00:26:43.123,they already started burning mugwort leaves.
00:26:43.390,00:26:44.880,四个月就烧艾,00:26:43.390,00:26:44.880,Burning mugwort already in the fourth month...
00:26:45.930,00:26:47.640,真难为了鹏妃的身子,00:26:45.930,00:26:47.640,The pregnancy must be hard on her body.
00:26:49.060,00:26:50.890,这些年她也算听话,00:26:49.060,00:26:50.890,"She has been obedient these years,"
00:26:51.230,00:26:53.350,一直在乖乖地服药 不曾有孕,00:26:51.230,00:26:53.350,taking the medicine and foregoing pregnancy.
00:26:53.900,00:26:55.260,现在听娘娘的话,00:26:53.900,00:26:55.449,Now she listens to Your Majesty
00:26:55.690,00:26:56.680,用了催孕的药,00:26:55.690,00:26:57.170,and took the fertility herbs.
00:26:57.360,00:26:59.100,让龙种待在肚子里几个月,00:26:57.360,00:26:59.100,She has already received the blessing
00:26:59.570,00:27:00.810,已经是她的福气了,00:26:59.570,00:27:01.320,"of carrying ""the dragon's child"" for a few months."
00:27:01.320,00:27:03.810,告诉太医 无论用什么法子,00:27:01.320,00:27:03.810,Tell the imperial doctors to do whatever they must
00:27:04.370,00:27:05.860,务必要使鹏妃的胎,00:27:04.370,00:27:05.860,to make her pregnancy
00:27:06.250,00:27:08.240,看起来安然无恙,00:27:06.250,00:27:08.240,appear safe and sound.
00:27:08.500,00:27:09.200,是,00:27:08.500,00:27:09.275,Yes.
00:27:14.250,00:27:16.210,今日黑艾到此为止,00:27:14.250,00:27:16.210,That's it for today's mugwort burning.
00:27:17.590,00:27:19.550,娘娘 这保胎药,00:27:17.590,00:27:19.550,Your Highness must
00:27:20.220,00:27:22.000,必须每日按时服用,00:27:20.220,00:27:22.113,"take the prenatal medicine on time every day,"
00:27:22.550,00:27:24.040,才能确保无虞,00:27:22.550,00:27:24.229,to ensure nothing goes amiss.
00:27:25.180,00:27:26.010,另外,00:27:25.180,00:27:26.010,"Additionally,"
00:27:26.430,00:27:29.010,娘娘一定要保持身心愉快,00:27:26.430,00:27:29.010,Your Highness must maintain a light heart
00:27:29.890,00:27:31.600,才能保得平安,00:27:29.890,00:27:31.864,for your safety during the pregnancy.
00:27:32.900,00:27:33.730,三日后,00:27:32.900,00:27:34.588,I will come back in three days
00:27:34.060,00:27:36.730,微臣会再来为娘娘黑艾保胎,00:27:34.588,00:27:36.730,"to burn mugwort again, to stabilize Your Highness's pregnancy."
00:27:37.730,00:27:39.820,那微臣就先告退了,00:27:37.730,00:27:39.820,I will take my leave now.
00:27:40.400,00:27:41.190,太医慢走,00:27:40.400,00:27:41.190,"Take care, doctor."
00:27:50.910,00:27:51.490,宝鹃,00:27:50.910,00:27:51.792,"Coua,"
00:27:52.460,00:27:54.070,快把这盒里的艾草拿去倒掉,00:27:52.460,00:27:54.070,go dump the mugwort residue from this bowl.
00:27:54.590,00:27:56.370,千万不能让人闻出黑艾的味道,00:27:54.590,00:27:56.370,We mustn't let people notice the odor of burnt mugwort.
00:27:56.630,00:27:57.240,是,00:27:56.630,00:27:57.240,Yes.
00:28:03.760,00:28:04.420,娘娘,00:28:03.760,00:28:04.571,"Your Highness,"
00:28:05.510,00:28:07.090,皇上要大封六宫的消息,00:28:05.510,00:28:07.090,the news that His Majesty is granting extensive promotions
00:28:07.390,00:28:08.220,可都传遍了,00:28:07.390,00:28:08.522,is spreading everywhere.
00:28:09.470,00:28:10.880,皇后提一句鹏妃,00:28:09.470,00:28:11.390,"Once Her Majesty mentioned Consort Oriole's promotion,"
00:28:11.390,00:28:13.730,娘娘立即提请六宫妃嫔都大封,00:28:11.390,00:28:13.730,Your Highness proposed harem-wide promotions.
00:28:14.690,00:28:15.640,这下大家伙,00:28:14.690,00:28:15.640,Now everybody
00:28:15.900,00:28:17.310,可都等着要感激娘娘呢,00:28:15.900,00:28:17.499,is waiting to thank Your Highness.
00:28:18.110,00:28:20.220,我是不想便宜了她一个人做好人,00:28:18.110,00:28:20.220,I don't want to let the Empress be the only good person.
00:28:21.400,00:28:22.730,皇后想台举安陵容,00:28:21.400,00:28:22.730,She wants to promote An Linrong.
00:28:23.490,00:28:24.900,我为何不顺水推舟呢,00:28:23.400,00:28:25.450,"I am merely ""pushing a boat already being carried by the current."""
00:28:25.450,00:28:26.660,有好大家分嘛,00:28:25.450,00:28:27.037,Good things are meant to be shared.
00:28:28.950,00:28:30.160,留着我想要的,00:28:28.950,00:28:30.160,Keeping what I want
00:28:30.700,00:28:32.110,剪去我认为多余的,00:28:30.700,00:28:32.374,while cutting what I see as redundant.
00:28:33.420,00:28:35.030,其实修剪花枝和整理后宫,00:28:33.420,00:28:35.030,Pruning the flower branches is just like
00:28:35.330,00:28:36.200,是一样的,00:28:35.330,00:28:36.200,sorting out the Harem.
00:28:36.920,00:28:38.200,这个道理我明白,00:28:36.920,00:28:38.200,I understand this.
00:28:38.880,00:28:39.960,皇后更明白,00:28:38.880,00:28:39.960,Her Majesty understands it even more.
00:28:40.630,00:28:44.470,这花咱们已经剪得很好看了,00:28:40.630,00:28:44.470,The flower branches have been pruned very well.
00:28:45.510,00:28:46.840,花叶和人一样,00:28:45.510,00:28:46.840,Flowers and leaves are like people.
00:28:47.100,00:28:48.430,随时都会旁逸斜出,00:28:47.100,00:28:48.430,They can grow out sideways at any time.
00:28:48.760,00:28:49.670,留神着点吧,00:28:48.760,00:28:49.849,We must stay observant.
00:28:50.560,00:28:51.470,娘娘说得是,00:28:50.560,00:28:51.470,Your Highness is right.
00:28:53.850,00:28:54.510,娘娘,00:28:53.850,00:28:54.774,Your Highness.
00:28:54.940,00:28:56.550,燕窝好了 娘娘请用,00:28:54.940,00:28:56.550,The bird's nest soup is ready for Your Highness.
00:29:01.650,00:29:03.140,这素来不都是血燕吗,00:29:01.650,00:29:03.140,Isn't it always red bird's nest?
00:29:03.700,00:29:04.980,今日怎么换了白燕了,00:29:03.700,00:29:05.055,Why is it white bird's nest today?
00:29:05.660,00:29:07.440,内务府说 皇后娘娘下旨,00:29:05.660,00:29:07.440,The Household Department said that Her Majesty decreed
00:29:07.740,00:29:08.570,说鹏妃有孕,00:29:07.740,00:29:08.910,"that because Consort Oriole is pregnant,"
00:29:09.240,00:29:10.980,血燕都尽供着延禧宫,00:29:09.240,00:29:11.206,"the red bird's nest will be provided only
to the Palace of Prolonging Happiness."
00:29:11.620,00:29:13.610,其他宫里暂时都只用白燕,00:29:11.620,00:29:13.610,All other palaces shall have only white bird's nest for now.
00:29:16.710,00:29:18.570,皇后可真疼惜鹏妃,00:29:16.710,00:29:18.759,Her Majesty cherishes Consort Oriole so endearingly.
00:29:19.880,00:29:22.290,若真要赏她大可不必这么显眼,00:29:19.880,00:29:22.290,"If she truly wants to reward her, it doesn't have to be so obvious."
00:29:22.920,00:29:25.080,一日一日命内务府送去便是了,00:29:22.920,00:29:25.080,Just ask the Household Department to send it daily.
00:29:26.220,00:29:27.750,这一下子全给了她,00:29:26.220,00:29:27.750,"But she gives all of it to her,"
00:29:28.220,00:29:29.340,反而叫六宫非议,00:29:28.220,00:29:29.717,which will raise complaints in the harem.
00:29:30.560,00:29:32.300,这就是皇后的厉害之处,00:29:30.560,00:29:32.300,That's the shrewdness of the Empress.
00:29:33.390,00:29:34.130,一来呢,00:29:33.390,00:29:34.430,"On one hand,"
00:29:34.430,00:29:36.970,让鹏妃不要得了身孕就得宠忘本,00:29:34.430,00:29:36.970,it reminds Consort Oriole not to forget
00:29:37.270,00:29:38.350,忘了皇后对她的好,00:29:37.270,00:29:38.350,Her Majesty's favors.
00:29:38.860,00:29:42.270,二来 鹏妃在宫中本来就树敌颇多,00:29:39.200,00:29:42.610,"On the other hand, Consort Oriole already has many enemies in the palace."
00:29:42.900,00:29:44.310,她得到的恩宠越多,00:29:42.900,00:29:44.310,"The more favor she gains,"
00:29:44.610,00:29:45.850,就越有人嫉恨她,00:29:44.610,00:29:46.076,the more people envy and resent her.
00:29:46.910,00:29:49.490,鹏妃为了保住自己和腹中的胎儿,00:29:46.910,00:29:49.490,"To protect herself and the child in her belly,"
00:29:49.910,00:29:52.620,只能牢牢地靠着皇后这棵大树,00:29:49.910,00:29:52.620,"she can only cling more tightly to ""the big tree."""
00:29:53.750,00:29:54.910,不过看样子,00:29:53.750,00:29:54.910,But it appears that
00:29:55.290,00:29:57.950,她们之间的嫌隙可不浅呢,00:29:55.290,00:29:57.950,the rift between them is not a small one.
00:30:01.920,00:30:04.290,奉天承运 皇帝诏曰,00:30:01.920,00:30:04.290,"By the grace of Heaven, His Majesty decrees:"

00:30:20.980,00:30:23.100,谢皇上隆恩,00:30:20.980,00:30:23.100,I thank His Majesty for the heavenly grace.
00:30:44.960,00:30:46.540,外头的歌舞声响起了,00:30:44.960,00:30:46.926,The music and dancing can be heard now.
00:30:47.470,00:30:49.380,大封六宫的典礼结束了吧,00:30:47.470,00:30:49.380,I suppose the promotion ceremony has just finished.
00:30:50.220,00:30:51.460,小主不去也好,00:30:50.220,00:30:51.460,"It's better you didn't go, My Lady."
00:30:52.010,00:30:54.720,怀着身孕不能去人多的地方,00:30:52.010,00:30:54.720,You can't go to crowded places while pregnant.
00:30:57.310,00:30:58.590,原是我不配,00:30:57.310,00:30:59.069,Because I'm not worth it.
00:30:59.690,00:31:00.890,小主别这样想,00:30:59.690,00:31:01.192,"Please don't think like that, My Lady."
00:31:01.610,00:31:03.440,皇后娘娘也是体恤小主,00:31:01.610,00:31:03.440,Her Majesty was considerate of you.
00:31:05.110,00:31:07.820,天气渐热 不宜去人多的地方,00:31:05.110,00:31:07.820,"The weather is getting hot;
it's not suitable for you to go to crowded places."
00:31:09.910,00:31:10.890,体恤,00:31:09.910,00:31:10.890,Considerate?
00:31:11.530,00:31:13.570,连死了的沈眉庄都得了晋封,00:31:11.530,00:31:13.784,Even the dead Shen Meizhuang got promoted.
00:31:13.990,00:31:15.480,皇上这是要打我的脸吗,00:31:13.990,00:31:15.669,Is His Majesty slapping me in the face?
00:31:15.950,00:31:17.110,小主您别这样说,00:31:15.950,00:31:17.110,Please don't say that.
00:31:17.450,00:31:19.040,肚子里的龙胎可忌讳着呢,00:31:17.450,00:31:19.040,"It's taboo for ""the dragon's child."""
00:31:19.410,00:31:20.490,有什么可忌讳的,00:31:19.410,00:31:20.490,Why?
00:31:21.420,00:31:22.450,死人不作数,00:31:21.420,00:31:22.714,Dead people don't matter.
00:31:24.380,00:31:26.240,我只是怕皇上心里有了什么,00:31:24.380,00:31:26.778,"I'm worried that His Majesty is making
 an implication about Meizhuang's death."
00:31:27.170,00:31:28.630,小主您别往心里去,00:31:27.170,00:31:28.630,Please don't take it to heart.
00:31:29.420,00:31:31.260,华贵妃那么招皇上不待见,00:31:29.420,00:31:31.260,"After all, His Majesty detested Noble Consort Fleur,"
00:31:31.680,00:31:33.540,不是也一样追封了皇贵妃吗,00:31:31.680,00:31:34.030,and she still got a posthumous promotion to Imperial Noble Consort.
00:31:34.390,00:31:36.380,皇上那只是怕落人口实,00:31:34.390,00:31:36.380,His Majesty is just afraid of people talking.
00:31:36.720,00:31:38.340,更是见面三分情罢了,00:31:36.720,00:31:39.676,"Besides, it would have been difficult to
 turn down a request made in person...."
00:31:38.980,00:31:39.590,顾着,,,
00:31:39.940,00:31:40.890,小主宽心,00:31:39.940,00:31:40.890,"Don't worry, My Lady."
00:31:41.310,00:31:42.930,皇上已经宽恕了安大人,00:31:41.310,00:31:42.930,His Majesty has pardoned Mr. An.
00:31:43.270,00:31:45.930,而且还赏了黄金百两返乡养老,00:31:43.270,00:31:46.400,"He was also awarded a hundred taels of gold
so he can retire to his hometown."
00:31:46.400,00:31:48.730,可见皇上对小主有多眷顾啊,00:31:46.400,00:31:48.730,That shows how much His Majesty cares about you.
00:31:51.860,00:31:53.100,等这件事办完,00:31:51.860,00:31:53.289,"Once this is over,"
00:31:54.160,00:31:56.490,也不枉我辛苦怀这个孩子几个月,00:31:54.160,00:31:56.490,all my effort to carry this child for months won't be wasted.
00:32:00.080,00:32:02.410,本宫可来晚了 好生热闹,00:32:00.080,00:32:02.410,Am I late? What a lively crowd here.
00:32:02.960,00:32:03.790,姐姐来了,00:32:02.960,00:32:03.790,"Lumière, you're here."
00:32:04.130,00:32:04.830,快躺下,00:32:04.130,00:32:04.830,Lie down.
00:32:05.840,00:32:07.120,如今你是有身孕的人,00:32:05.840,00:32:07.120,"Now that you're pregnant,"
00:32:07.710,00:32:08.920,该好好歇着才是,00:32:07.710,00:32:08.920,all you need to do is rest.
00:32:09.760,00:32:12.920,宝鹃 把我收着的雨前龙井拿来,00:32:09.760,00:32:12.920,"Coua, serve my pre-rain Longjing tea."
00:32:13.140,00:32:14.630,想必熹贵妃也喜欢,00:32:13.140,00:32:14.630,I suppose Noble Consort Lumiere will like it.
00:32:15.100,00:32:15.710,是,00:32:15.100,00:32:15.710,Yes.
00:32:17.680,00:32:19.090,我记得妹妹素日用的,00:32:17.680,00:32:19.090,I remember you usually use
00:32:19.430,00:32:20.890,是一个钻金枝软枕,00:32:19.430,00:32:20.890,a pillow made with gold thread woven through it.
00:32:21.690,00:32:24.140,今日怎么倒用起这个软枕来了,00:32:21.690,00:32:24.140,How come you're using this other pillow now?
00:32:24.690,00:32:25.680,妹妹有所不知,00:32:24.690,00:32:25.920,"Lumière, you might not know"
00:32:26.440,00:32:28.600,鹏妃妹妹如今有孕在身,00:32:26.440,00:32:28.600,"that because Consort Oriole is pregnant now,"
00:32:28.940,00:32:30.810,之前那个钻金枝的软枕,00:32:28.940,00:32:30.810,the pillow made with gold thread
00:32:31.110,00:32:34.100,虽然是金线绣的 难免有些粗糙,00:32:31.110,00:32:34.100,can still feel too rough despite its material.
00:32:34.410,00:32:35.940,皇上为了让鹏妃妹妹,00:32:34.410,00:32:35.940,His Majesty specifically ordered
00:32:36.320,00:32:37.190,睡得安稳一些,00:32:35.940,00:32:37.190,this pillow with Suzhou embroidery
00:32:37.450,00:32:40.030,特地命人用这苏绣的软枕,00:32:37.450,00:32:40.030,so Consort Oriole can have more restful sleep.
00:32:40.500,00:32:43.280,这枕头的枕芯啊 还是粟玉做的呢,00:32:40.500,00:32:43.280,"The pillow is filled with millet grains,"
00:32:43.670,00:32:45.530,据说最能养神了,00:32:43.670,00:32:45.530,which is said to be best for nourishing one's energy.
00:32:46.330,00:32:48.670,我一直用一个连云锦的枕头,00:32:46.330,00:32:48.670,I always used a pillow made of the cloud brocade.
00:32:49.170,00:32:49.910,前几日呢,00:32:49.170,00:32:49.910,"A few days ago,"
00:32:50.170,00:32:52.330,皇上刚赏了楼金线的暗花枕,00:32:50.170,00:32:52.544,"His Majesty awarded me a pillow with
a dark flower pattern embroidered with gold threads."
00:32:53.130,00:32:54.710,我还爱得跟什么似的,00:32:53.130,00:32:54.748,I love it so much.
00:32:56.090,00:32:57.930,到底是我皮糙肉厚,00:32:56.090,00:32:58.194,"After all, my skin is thick and rough"
00:32:58.350,00:33:00.340,不晓得金线粗糙,00:32:58.350,00:33:00.480,and cannot feel the coarseness of gold threads.
00:33:03.060,00:33:04.220,好香的茶,00:33:03.060,00:33:04.522,The tea is so aromatic.
00:33:04.850,00:33:07.520,我宫里的竟比不上这里的一半,00:33:04.850,00:33:07.520,What my palace has is not even half as good.
00:33:07.810,00:33:08.640,姐姐说笑了,00:33:07.810,00:33:08.866,You must be joking.
00:33:09.190,00:33:09.980,我的东西,00:33:09.190,00:33:10.230,What I have
00:33:10.230,00:33:11.970,怎么能跟姐姐的东西相比呢,00:33:10.230,00:33:11.970,is never comparable to yours.
00:33:12.530,00:33:13.980,姐姐不嫌弃也就罢了,00:33:12.530,00:33:14.779,It's fortunate that you're willing to accept my poor offerings.
00:33:16.910,00:33:18.150,如今妹妹有了身孕,00:33:16.910,00:33:18.339,"Now that you're pregnant,"
00:33:18.910,00:33:20.320,怎么还用这么重的香呢,00:33:18.910,00:33:20.735,why are you still using such strong incense?
00:33:21.040,00:33:22.240,可要小心些才好,00:33:21.040,00:33:22.240,It's better to be careful.
00:33:23.000,00:33:23.950,尤其是麝香,00:33:23.000,00:33:23.950,Especially musk.
00:33:24.620,00:33:26.580,妹妹素爱调香 可别弄错了,00:33:24.620,00:33:26.580,You love creating incense. Don't make any mistakes.
00:33:28.590,00:33:29.540,姐姐言重了,00:33:28.590,00:33:29.804,"You're overthinking, Lumière."
00:33:30.170,00:33:32.290,那香是用鲜花汁子调的,00:33:30.170,00:33:32.290,The incense is made from the juice of fresh flowers.
00:33:32.960,00:33:35.380,哪里用得上麝香那么名贵的香料,00:33:32.960,00:33:35.380,How can I afford to use precious spices like musk?
00:33:36.340,00:33:37.330,妹妹还说嘴呢,00:33:36.340,00:33:37.632,"You can say what you want,"
00:33:38.930,00:33:40.970,这纱原叫月影纱,00:33:38.930,00:33:41.350,"but this satin, it's called moon shadow satin."
00:33:41.350,00:33:42.680,是外头贡来的珍品,00:33:41.350,00:33:42.680,It's a precious and exotic tribute.
00:33:43.230,00:33:44.840,一匹之价不下百金,00:33:43.230,00:33:45.104,One piece of it is worth at least a hundred taels of gold.
00:33:45.440,00:33:46.270,挂在屋子里,00:33:45.440,00:33:46.900,"Hanging in the chamber,"
00:33:46.900,00:33:49.560,日光再渗漏进来也如月光柔和,00:33:46.900,00:33:49.560,it renders sunlight as soft as the light of the moon.
00:33:50.270,00:33:53.560,单看妹妹殿里这些便是万金之数,00:33:50.270,00:33:53.560,"Just looking at your chamber, it is worth
at least tens of thousands of gold taels."
00:33:54.690,00:33:55.480,你自己说,00:33:54.690,00:33:55.970,"Ask yourself,"
00:33:56.150,00:33:58.610,旁人宫里的能不能和你比去,00:33:56.150,00:33:58.610,how can other palaces compare with yours?
00:33:59.370,00:34:01.700,可见皇上心疼你,00:33:59.370,00:34:01.700,"Obviously, His Majesty cherishes you so much."
00:34:02.580,00:34:03.440,可不是吗,00:34:02.580,00:34:03.553,Isn't that so?
00:34:03.830,00:34:06.490,皇上可看重鹏妃的胎了,00:34:03.830,00:34:06.490,His Majesty thinks so highly of Consort Oriole's pregnancy.
00:34:06.870,00:34:09.580,姐姐若是喜欢 妹妹便送给姐姐,00:34:06.870,00:34:09.580,"Lumière, if you like, I can give them to you."
00:34:10.040,00:34:11.000,还请姐姐笑纳,00:34:10.040,00:34:11.226,Please do accept them.
00:34:12.000,00:34:13.620,我怎好白拿妹妹的东西,00:34:12.000,00:34:13.620,I can't accept gifts meant for you.
00:34:14.460,00:34:15.290,话说回来,00:34:14.460,00:34:15.680,"Speaking of which,"
00:34:15.880,00:34:17.460,我是来贺妹妹有孕之喜,00:34:15.880,00:34:17.460,"I'm here to congratulate your pregnancy,"
00:34:17.800,00:34:19.340,再贺妹妹晋升妃位,00:34:17.800,00:34:19.340,as well as your promotion to Consort.
00:34:19.890,00:34:20.750,小允子 来,00:34:19.890,00:34:20.750,"Xiao-Yunzi, come."
00:34:20.930,00:34:21.460,在,00:34:20.930,00:34:21.460,Yes.
00:34:24.680,00:34:26.840,这白玉扇子用来扇凉最好,00:34:24.680,00:34:26.840,This fan is made of pale jade and is the best for summer.
00:34:27.350,00:34:28.560,握在手里也不生热,00:34:27.350,00:34:28.862,The handle always stays cool to the touch.
00:34:30.440,00:34:32.300,这红宝石未经雕琢,00:34:30.440,00:34:32.300,These rubies are raw and uncut.
00:34:33.150,00:34:35.730,可以请能工巧匠镶嵌到冠上去,00:34:33.150,00:34:35.730,You can ask the skilled craftsmen to decorate a coronet with them.
00:34:37.650,00:34:38.770,旁的也就罢了,00:34:37.650,00:34:38.921,All the gifts are so unique.
00:34:39.700,00:34:41.650,这鸽子血艳红如血,00:34:39.700,00:34:41.801,"The ""pigeon's blood"" ruby is so pure and brightly colored;"
00:34:42.120,00:34:43.480,半点杂质都没有,00:34:42.120,00:34:43.631,there is no impurity within it at all.
00:34:43.830,00:34:44.990,真是好看极了,00:34:43.830,00:34:44.990,It is so gorgeous.
00:34:45.540,00:34:46.780,妹妹哪里能收姐姐,00:34:45.540,00:34:47.840,"How can I accept such expensive gifts from you, Lumière?"
00:34:47.120,00:34:47.950,这么贵重的东西,,,
00:34:49.500,00:34:51.210,妹妹是皇上心中至宝,00:34:49.500,00:34:51.210,You are the jewel in His Majesty's crown.
00:34:51.710,00:34:52.750,若不是这样的东西,00:34:51.710,00:34:53.040,Anything less than these
00:34:53.040,00:34:54.200,怎能配得上妹妹呢,00:34:53.040,00:34:54.351,is not worthy of you.
00:34:57.550,00:35:00.090,为鹏妃安胎的太医可在,00:34:57.550,00:35:00.090,Is the doctor for Consort Oriole's prenatal care here?
00:35:00.720,00:35:01.750,回禀熹贵妃,00:35:00.720,00:35:01.939,"Your Noble Highness,"
00:35:02.140,00:35:03.170,是许太医在,00:35:02.140,00:35:03.170,it is Dr. Xu.
00:35:04.350,00:35:05.590,见过熹贵妃,00:35:04.350,00:35:05.816,I greet Noble Highness Lumière.
00:35:06.640,00:35:08.350,如今妹妹是有了身孕的人,00:35:06.640,00:35:08.350,"Since you are now pregnant,"
00:35:08.940,00:35:10.180,万事该格外当心,00:35:08.940,00:35:10.633,you must exercise extra care in everything.
00:35:11.150,00:35:12.600,恰如皇后娘娘所说,00:35:11.150,00:35:13.128,"Just like what Her Majesty the Empress said,"
00:35:13.440,00:35:15.480,万勿像我当年一般不慎小产,00:35:13.440,00:35:15.480,you must avoid the misery of miscarriage like me.
00:35:16.990,00:35:18.940,今日莫说我送妹妹的东西,00:35:16.990,00:35:18.940,"All items from anyone must be carefully examined,"
00:35:19.450,00:35:21.730,任何人送的都要一一验过才好,00:35:19.450,00:35:21.730,"including my gifts today,"
00:35:22.870,00:35:24.900,姐姐说这话便是见外了,00:35:22.870,00:35:24.900,"Lumière, please don't speak as if we were strangers."
00:35:25.370,00:35:26.700,妹妹如何当得起呢,00:35:25.370,00:35:27.002,I do not deserve you saying that.
00:35:27.500,00:35:29.530,妹妹若对姐姐存了半分疑心,00:35:27.500,00:35:29.530,"If I have a shred of suspicion against you,"
00:35:29.750,00:35:30.160,必定,00:35:29.750,00:35:30.360,I must be...
00:35:30.370,00:35:31.860,说什么呢 也不怕忌讳,00:35:30.370,00:35:31.860,Don't say it! There are taboos.
00:35:33.790,00:35:34.660,我这么做,,,
00:35:35.170,00:35:36.750,正是为了咱们的姐妹情分,00:35:33.790,00:35:36.800,I am doing this for the sake of our sisterhood.
00:35:38.210,00:35:39.750,万一有人要动什么手脚,00:35:38.210,00:35:40.000,"If anyone wants to tamper with my gifts,"
00:35:40.300,00:35:41.790,也不至于有下手之机呀,00:35:40.300,00:35:41.790,they will have no chance to do so.
00:35:42.180,00:35:42.760,其实,00:35:42.180,00:35:42.880,Actually...
00:35:42.970,00:35:43.750,这位是卫太医,00:35:42.970,00:35:43.863,This is Dr. Wei.
00:35:44.600,00:35:47.210,两位太医一同察看便更妥当些,00:35:44.600,00:35:47.210,Examination by two doctors will set my mind completely at ease.
00:36:07.040,00:36:07.770,回禀娘娘 这些东西里,00:36:07.040,00:36:08.080,"Your Highness,"
00:36:08.080,00:36:11.200,并没有半点损伤胎气的东西,00:36:08.080,00:36:11.200,there is nothing harmful to the prenatal qi in these presents.
00:36:11.960,00:36:12.620,是,00:36:11.960,00:36:12.771,Agreed.
00:36:13.750,00:36:16.370,如此 我和安妹妹都能安心了,00:36:13.750,00:36:16.370,Then both of us can put our minds at ease.
00:36:18.000,00:36:19.590,安妹妹好容易有了身孕,00:36:18.000,00:36:19.840,"Lingrong, it hasn't been easy for you to get pregnant."
00:36:19.840,00:36:20.790,更要好好保养,00:36:19.840,00:36:21.243,You must nourish yourself well.
00:36:21.840,00:36:22.960,今日卫太医也在,00:36:21.840,00:36:23.337,"Since Dr. Wei is here today,"
00:36:23.760,00:36:26.250,不如请他再请一次脉如何,00:36:23.760,00:36:26.250,"how about letting him take your pulse,"
00:36:26.760,00:36:27.500,也好多一重保险,00:36:26.760,00:36:27.680,so we can all feel assured?
00:36:27.680,00:36:28.760,多谢姐姐关心,00:36:27.680,00:36:28.760,Thank you for your concern.
00:36:29.720,00:36:32.310,本该听姐姐的话再多请一次脉,00:36:29.720,00:36:32.310,"I should take your advice to have another pulse-taking,"
00:36:33.020,00:36:36.060,只是这许太医是皇后娘娘举荐的,00:36:33.020,00:36:36.060,but Dr. Xu was recommended by Her Majesty.
00:36:36.980,00:36:39.560,我与姐姐一样 本该多一重心安,00:36:36.980,00:36:39.560,"While I feel the same way about having more assurance,"
00:36:40.240,00:36:42.480,不过若皇后娘娘知道的话,00:36:40.240,00:36:42.480,"if Her Majesty finds out about this,"
00:36:42.700,00:36:44.900,怕是咱们以为许太医医术不佳呢,00:36:42.700,00:36:44.900,she might misunderstand and think we question Dr. Xu's proficiency.
00:36:48.240,00:36:50.950,那请问许太医 鹏妃胎气如何,00:36:48.240,00:36:50.950,"Then, Dr. Xu, how is Lady Oriole's prenatal qi?"
00:36:51.620,00:36:54.660,鹏妃娘娘胎气甚稳,00:36:51.620,00:36:54.660,"Oh, Lady Oriole's prenatal qi is very stable."
00:36:55.330,00:36:58.450,您只看她的好气色便可知一二了,00:36:55.330,00:36:58.450,Your Highness can tell through her glowing complexion.
00:36:59.380,00:37:01.670,鹏妃素爱用香也无碍吗,00:36:59.380,00:37:01.670,Is there any problem with Consort Oriole using incense?
00:37:02.550,00:37:03.210,无碍,00:37:02.550,00:37:03.361,That's fine.
00:37:08.050,00:37:09.340,妹妹最擅制香,00:37:08.050,00:37:09.604,"Lingrong, you are good at making incense."
00:37:09.890,00:37:12.130,不知今日宫里点的是什么香啊,00:37:09.890,00:37:12.130,I wonder what you are using today?
00:37:12.810,00:37:13.670,叫凝露香,00:37:12.810,00:37:14.387,It's called the Condensed Dew.
00:37:14.560,00:37:15.720,姐姐若是喜欢,00:37:14.560,00:37:15.720,"If you like it,"
00:37:16.020,00:37:17.350,我送一些与姐姐可好,00:37:16.020,00:37:17.350,I can give you some as a gift.
00:37:18.820,00:37:21.350,宝鹃 到我的香料盒子里,00:37:18.820,00:37:21.521,"Coua, take some from my incense box"
00:37:21.740,00:37:23.400,包好凝露香送与熹贵妃,00:37:21.740,00:37:23.650,and pack it up well for Noble Highness Lumière.
00:37:23.650,00:37:24.190,是,00:37:23.650,00:37:24.190,Yes.
00:37:25.660,00:37:27.110,怎能劳动妹妹身边的人,00:37:25.660,00:37:27.110,How can I order your personal maid around?
00:37:27.910,00:37:28.570,小允子,00:37:27.910,00:37:28.700,Xiao-Yunzi.
00:37:28.700,00:37:29.230,在,00:37:28.700,00:37:29.230,Yes.
00:37:29.580,00:37:30.410,跟着宝鹃去取香料,00:37:29.580,00:37:30.690,Follow Coua to get the incense.
00:37:30.580,00:37:31.190,嘛,00:37:30.690,00:37:31.190,Yes.
00:37:39.340,00:37:40.450,可看出什么不妥吗,00:37:39.340,00:37:40.601,Did you notice anything wrong?
00:37:41.170,00:37:42.960,一时察觉不出来什么,00:37:41.170,00:37:42.960,"It's hard to tell right now,"
00:37:43.550,00:37:45.500,但是微臣心中也有疑惑,00:37:43.550,00:37:45.500,but I do have doubts about something.
00:37:46.380,00:37:48.470,娘娘 微臣现在还没有把握,00:37:46.380,00:37:48.470,"Your Highness, I can't be sure yet."
00:37:48.890,00:37:51.090,待回去定下来了 再来回禀娘娘,00:37:48.890,00:37:51.090,"After I confirm, I will report to Your Highness."
00:37:59.150,00:38:00.510,奴才方才去拿那凝露香,00:37:59.150,00:38:00.510,"When I was there to fetch the Condensed Dew incense,"
00:38:00.820,00:38:02.650,有几个香盒子搁在高架子顶上,00:38:00.820,00:38:02.650,I saw some incense boxes put on high shelves.
00:38:02.940,00:38:04.650,说是鹏妃自己收起来的 不爱用了,00:38:02.940,00:38:04.650,"She said Consort Oriole put them away
because she no longer likes them."
00:38:05.360,00:38:07.020,奴才看那盒子描得十分精致,00:38:05.360,00:38:07.246,"However, those boxes were so delicately painted,"
00:38:07.450,00:38:08.440,不像是不要了的东西,00:38:07.450,00:38:08.780,they didn't look like unwanted items.
00:38:09.280,00:38:10.240,趁宝鹃不注意时,,,
00:38:10.580,00:38:11.990,用银耳针撬开来拿了几颗,00:38:09.280,00:38:12.089,"When Coua wasn't paying attention, I pried open a box and took a bit."
00:38:12.540,00:38:13.650,好像也是香蜜之类,00:38:12.540,00:38:13.914,They seem to be incense cones.
00:38:24.960,00:38:26.040,香味甚异,00:38:24.960,00:38:26.266,The aroma is really strange.
00:38:26.930,00:38:27.910,这是什么东西啊,00:38:26.930,00:38:28.160,What is that?
00:38:33.560,00:38:35.260,本宫召你来是想问一问,00:38:33.560,00:38:35.524,I called you because I wanted to ask one thing.
00:38:37.140,00:38:38.850,鹏妃的胎气可还稳当,00:38:37.140,00:38:39.076,Is Consort Oriole's prenatal qi stable?
00:38:40.560,00:38:41.390,回禀娘娘,00:38:40.560,00:38:41.579,"Your Noble Highness,"
00:38:42.270,00:38:43.480,正如娘娘的猜测,00:38:42.270,00:38:43.480,"as you presumed,"
00:38:43.780,00:38:46.440,鹏妃的孩子恐怕是生不下来,00:38:43.780,00:38:46.440,Consort Oriole probably won't be able to deliver the baby.
00:38:50.490,00:38:51.400,你怎么知道本宫猜测,,,
00:38:51.780,00:38:53.110,鹏妃的孩子生不下来,00:38:50.490,00:38:53.402,"How do you know I presumed
that her baby cannot be delivered?"
00:38:54.330,00:38:57.410,诬崎本宫罪名可不小,00:38:54.330,00:38:57.410,Defaming me is not a minor offense.
00:38:58.330,00:38:58.990,微臣不敢,00:38:58.330,00:38:59.330,I don't dare.
00:39:00.460,00:39:02.040,给鹏妃把脉的许太医,00:39:00.460,00:39:02.040,Dr. Xu who checks Consort Oriole's pulse
00:39:02.340,00:39:03.420,已经报过胎像平和,00:39:02.340,00:39:03.910,already reported her pregnancy is stable.
00:39:04.300,00:39:05.540,娘娘若是相信,00:39:04.300,00:39:05.540,"If Your Highness believed that,"
00:39:05.960,00:39:07.630,自然不会来问微臣,00:39:05.960,00:39:07.630,you wouldn't come ask me.
00:39:08.630,00:39:09.590,起来说话吧,00:39:08.630,00:39:10.000,Rise and speak.
00:39:10.590,00:39:11.210,谢娘娘,00:39:10.590,00:39:11.889,I thank Your Highness.
00:39:12.050,00:39:13.130,你既知本宫疑虑,00:39:12.050,00:39:13.620,"You know I have doubts,"
00:39:13.930,00:39:14.920,说实情就是,00:39:13.930,00:39:15.335,so just tell me the truth.
00:39:17.060,00:39:19.270,微臣趁人不觉时看过脉案,00:39:17.060,00:39:19.270,I privately checked her pulse-taking records.
00:39:19.730,00:39:21.310,写的是胎像平和,00:39:19.730,00:39:21.310,It's written that her pulse condition is moderate
00:39:21.650,00:39:23.310,不过是普通的安胎药罢了,00:39:21.650,00:39:23.310,and normal prenatal formulas are prescribed.
00:39:24.150,00:39:25.180,但是在药材中,00:39:24.150,00:39:25.570,"But in the herbs,"
00:39:25.570,00:39:28.560,却增加了艾叶 黄苓 苎麻根,00:39:25.570,00:39:28.560,"they added mugwort leaf, skullcap, zhumagen,"
00:39:28.780,00:39:29.690,和白术等药,00:39:28.780,00:39:30.000,and baizhu.
00:39:31.820,00:39:33.150,别的本宫倒是不知,00:39:31.820,00:39:33.339,"I don't know about the other herbs,"
00:39:34.240,00:39:37.280,只是那艾叶却是温经止血的,00:39:34.240,00:39:37.280,but isn't mugwort for soothing the menstrual flow and stopping bleeding?
00:39:38.040,00:39:39.820,不到必要时 断断不可轻用,00:39:38.040,00:39:39.820,One must not use it unless strictly necessary.
00:39:40.290,00:39:41.030,娘娘睿智,00:39:40.290,00:39:41.370,Your Highness is wise.
00:39:41.620,00:39:43.830,那日鹏妃殿中虽然点了香,00:39:41.620,00:39:43.981,"The other day, even though Consort Oriole lit incense in her palace,"
00:39:44.170,00:39:45.410,掩盖了黑艾的气味,00:39:44.170,00:39:46.844,"which covered the smell of burning mugwort leaves,"
00:39:46.090,00:39:47.700,但是微臣依然察觉到,,,
00:39:48.170,00:39:49.160,有黑艾的痕述,00:39:46.844,00:39:49.748,I still noticed traces of burnt mugwort.
00:39:50.130,00:39:52.340,鹏妃有孕四月便已用艾叶,00:39:50.130,00:39:52.340,She has already started using mugwort leaves in the fourth month.
00:39:52.760,00:39:54.670,可知已出现出血的状况,00:39:52.760,00:39:54.934,It can be inferred that she has experienced bleeding.
00:39:55.350,00:39:58.260,此外黄苓 白术 苎麻根,00:39:55.350,00:39:58.260,"Besides, huangqin, zhumagen, and baizhu"
00:39:58.980,00:40:00.470,都有止血补气之效,00:39:58.980,00:40:00.998,also stop bleeding and restore qi.
00:40:01.270,00:40:03.980,说明鹏妃已经有气血两虚,00:40:01.270,00:40:03.980,"This shows that Consort Oriole already has qi and blood deficiencies,"
00:40:04.360,00:40:05.690,有盗汗滑胎述象,00:40:04.360,00:40:06.150,"and suffers from night sweats and ""slippery fetus."""
00:40:06.150,00:40:07.560,另外微臣还听说,00:40:06.150,00:40:07.560,I have also heard that
00:40:07.820,00:40:09.980,鹏妃近日心情郁郁寡欢,00:40:07.820,00:40:09.980,Consort Oriole has been dispirited lately.
00:40:10.650,00:40:11.690,只怕月份越大,00:40:10.650,00:40:12.030,"I'm afraid as her months grow,"
00:40:12.030,00:40:13.690,龙胎在腹中岌岌可危,00:40:12.030,00:40:13.690,her pregnancy will become more precarious.
00:40:14.120,00:40:15.570,断断拖不到足月生产,00:40:14.120,00:40:15.796,There's no chance of a full-term pregnancy.
00:40:15.990,00:40:16.820,事无完全,00:40:15.990,00:40:17.235,There is always a possibility.
00:40:17.950,00:40:19.490,诸位太医竭尽全力,00:40:17.950,00:40:19.679,"If all imperial doctors do their best,"
00:40:20.080,00:40:22.570,或许还能保住鹏妃顺利生产,00:40:20.080,00:40:22.570,perhaps Consort Oriole can still have a smooth delivery.
00:40:23.170,00:40:26.280,鹏妃用艾已知自己此胎不保,00:40:23.170,00:40:26.280,"Consort Oriole is using mugwort leaves.
She already knows she can't have the baby."
00:40:26.750,00:40:28.040,倘若此胎真的不保,00:40:26.750,00:40:28.040,"If she really can't keep it,"
00:40:29.130,00:40:30.920,娘娘以为责任在谁,00:40:29.130,00:40:31.499,who does Your Highness think will be held responsible for that?
00:40:34.890,00:40:36.550,若是她自己保不住也算了,00:40:34.890,00:40:36.852,It's no matter if she herself can't keep it.
00:40:37.720,00:40:40.210,否则碰上谁 便是谁倒楣了,00:40:37.720,00:40:40.611,"But if someone happens to collide with her,
it will be their bad luck."
00:40:41.680,00:40:42.890,此事你知我知,00:40:41.680,00:40:43.079,Only you and I should know this.
00:40:43.810,00:40:46.640,本宫自然不必担这干系,00:40:43.810,00:40:46.640,Surely I will bear no responsibility for it.
00:40:51.240,00:40:52.850,你瞧瞧 这是什么,00:40:51.240,00:40:52.850,"Take a look, what is this?"
00:41:14.760,00:41:15.340,槿汐,00:41:14.760,00:41:15.529,Jinxi.
00:41:21.470,00:41:23.760,娘娘恕罪 微臣实在轻率,00:41:21.470,00:41:23.760,"Forgive me Your Highness, I was too careless."
00:41:24.020,00:41:25.680,不知此香药效如此厉害,00:41:24.020,00:41:25.680,I didn't know this incense was so powerful.
00:41:26.190,00:41:26.770,是什么,00:41:26.190,00:41:27.147,What is it?
00:41:28.980,00:41:31.190,男女欢好 以此迷情,00:41:28.980,00:41:31.190,It's stimulating incense for intimate affairs.
00:41:32.990,00:41:34.570,你只用水化开了这么一点,00:41:32.990,00:41:34.759,"Only a tiny amount was dissolved,"
00:41:35.150,00:41:35.940,就这样厉害,00:41:35.150,00:41:36.166,yet it's this strong.
00:41:36.320,00:41:37.190,娘娘有所不知,00:41:36.320,00:41:37.780,Your Highness is not aware
00:41:37.780,00:41:40.150,此香中依兰香和蛇床子,00:41:37.780,00:41:40.376,the ylang-ylang and snake's bed seeds in the incense
00:41:40.580,00:41:41.780,放了十足十的量,00:41:40.580,00:41:41.780,are exceedingly concentrated.
00:41:42.120,00:41:45.330,若将此香焚烧 此效会更加厉害,00:41:42.120,00:41:45.330,"If it's burnt, the effect would be even more powerful."
00:41:45.830,00:41:47.370,所以在平时用的时候,00:41:45.830,00:41:47.370,"Therefore, when it's in use,"
00:41:47.630,00:41:48.610,只是掺一星半点,00:41:47.630,00:41:48.610,only a tiny amount
00:41:48.960,00:41:50.870,在其他的香料中便可见效,00:41:48.960,00:41:51.093,needs to be mixed with other incense to be effective.
00:41:51.550,00:41:52.460,也不易察觉,00:41:51.550,00:41:53.320,And it would be hard to notice that way.
00:41:54.300,00:41:57.010,这依兰花有使人动情之效,00:41:54.300,00:41:57.010,Ylang-ylang has the effect of arousing sensual desires.
00:41:59.350,00:42:02.010,如果碰上鹅梨帐中香会怎样,00:41:59.350,00:42:02.010,"What happens if ylang-ylang is
mixed with the Goose Pear Bedside Incense?"
00:42:02.680,00:42:04.890,同效 只是不及此香厉害,00:42:02.680,00:42:04.890,"Same effect, just not as powerful as using this incense alone."
00:42:05.310,00:42:07.770,娘娘 依兰花毕竟是草植,00:42:05.310,00:42:07.770,"Your Highness, ylang-ylang is harmless in nature,"
00:42:08.310,00:42:09.550,而此香中的依兰花,00:42:08.310,00:42:09.900,"but in this incense, the ingredient"
00:42:09.900,00:42:11.230,是经过大量的提纯,00:42:09.900,00:42:11.494,has been immensely concentrated.
00:42:12.110,00:42:14.520,娘娘可知依兰花并不常有,00:42:12.110,00:42:14.743,Your Highness may know that ylang-ylang is rarely available in the palace.
00:42:14.990,00:42:17.600,而有此香便可岁岁年年无虑了,00:42:14.990,00:42:17.600,Whoever has this incense would maintain favor year after year.

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."

but you will never see it.",00:44:33.000,00:44:41.000,"A phoenix about to take flight rustles its wings
but the arc of its flight is unseen."

shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
