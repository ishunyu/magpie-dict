00:02:24.400,00:02:27.190,事务缠身 皇上日夜辛劳,00:02:23.000,00:02:26.600,Your majesty has been working day and night.
00:02:28.520,00:02:30.190,喝口茶提提神吧,00:02:27.000,00:02:29.940,Please have some tea to refresh yourself.
00:02:32.360,00:02:36.110,国事烦忧 家事也不轻松,00:02:31.420,00:02:38.400,"The harem is no less complicated than state affairs.
You must have worked as hard as I have."
00:02:37.520,00:02:38.390,难为你了,,,
00:02:40.040,00:02:41.870,是处将军的折子吧,00:02:38.900,00:02:41.540,"It is the memorandum from General Nian, isn’t it?"
00:02:43.480,00:02:47.790,说是西北战事顺利一切平稳,00:02:42.260,00:02:47.280,Mm ... He says the wars in the northwest are proceeding well.
00:02:49.240,00:02:50.910,处将军沙场征战,,,
00:02:51.160,00:02:53.990,他的妹妹在后宫里头忙碌奔波,00:02:48.140,00:02:54.060,"While General Nian charges on the battlefield,
his sister prances around in the harem."
00:02:55.600,00:02:58.230,刚才一大早御膳房就来禀报,00:02:54.480,00:03:02.000,"The Imperial Kitchen reported that Xiao Tang confessed
his misconduct in storing the ingredients."
00:02:59.600,00:03:02.710,说掌管糕点材料的小唐出首认罪,,,
00:03:03.320,00:03:05.030,说自己是一时疏忽,00:03:02.000,00:03:05.720,"He claimed that it was his oversight to
have mixed in the cassava starch"
00:03:05.360,00:03:06.550,弄混了两种粉料,00:03:05.720,00:03:07.480,and caused Princess Wenyi's illness.
00:03:06.840,00:03:08.150,才致使公主不适,,,
00:03:08.720,00:03:11.070,现在御膳房正等皇上示下,00:03:07.480,00:03:12.880,"The Imperial Kitchen is awaiting
Your Majesty's order as to how to deal with him."
00:03:11.880,00:03:13.510,是要如何发落呀,,,
00:03:14.160,00:03:15.950,她们倒是雷厉风行,00:03:13.120,00:03:17.840,They were very efficient in discovering the culprit.
00:03:16.400,00:03:18.190,一下子就找出真凶了,,,
00:03:19.280,00:03:20.670,人是找出来了,00:03:18.220,00:03:23.120,"Although they have identified the person,
it's up to Your Majesty whether to end the investigation."
00:03:21.040,00:03:22.430,要不要就此了结,,,
00:03:22.760,00:03:23.830,要看皇上的意思了,00:03:23.240,00:03:24.760,What do you think?
00:03:24.560,00:03:25.350,你怎么看,,,
00:03:25.920,00:03:27.070,后宫不宁,00:03:24.760,00:03:29.740,"Your Majesty won't be able to focus on  state affairs
if the harem is not at peace."
00:03:27.920,00:03:30.190,皇上也无法安心处理政事,,,
00:03:31.120,00:03:34.590,有人位高权重却屡生事端,00:03:30.100,00:03:33.840,"Someone in high power is
repeatedly creating disturbances in the harem."
00:03:35.120,00:03:36.270,不惜利用公主,00:03:33.840,00:03:37.920,"She has now even used the princess to defame
Your Majesty's beloved concubine."
00:03:36.560,00:03:38.270,来陷害皇上心爱之人,,,
00:03:39.160,00:03:42.430,臣妾以为此风不可长,00:03:38.000,00:03:41.980,I believe we should not encourage such behavior.
00:03:43.720,00:03:46.630,后宫不宁 前朝也会不安,00:03:42.560,00:03:46.900,An unpeaceful harem will disturb the imperial court.
00:03:48.480,00:03:50.110,这件事再查下去,,,
00:03:50.760,00:03:55.110,只怕会伤了将士们沙场征战之心,00:03:47.400,00:03:54.800,"I'm afraid further investigation will
undermine the morale of the soldiers."
00:03:56.320,00:03:57.590,此事到此为止吧,00:03:54.980,00:03:57.400,So much for the investigation.
00:03:59.920,00:04:03.110,那皇上就要好生地安慰莞贵人了,00:03:58.060,00:04:02.280,"(laughing inwardly) If so, Your Majesty must
thoughtfully comfort Lady Sourire."
00:04:03.760,00:04:04.350,朕知道,00:04:02.280,00:04:03.880,I understand.
00:04:05.000,00:04:05.870,那小唐呢,00:04:03.880,00:04:05.580,What about Xiao Tang?
00:04:06.920,00:04:07.550,杖杀,00:04:05.580,00:04:07.780,Flog to death.
00:04:18.000,00:04:18.990,我手心出汗了,00:04:16.980,00:04:18.580,My hands are sweating.
00:04:19.440,00:04:22.190,怕弄污了丝线的颜色先去洗手,00:04:18.580,00:04:21.500,I will go wash my hands in case I stain the embroidery.
00:04:36.440,00:04:37.150,浣碧,00:04:35.260,00:04:37.140,Jade.
00:04:40.040,00:04:42.190,小主 是要一些茶水和水果吗,00:04:38.860,00:04:43.540,"My Lady, would you like some tea and snacks?"
00:04:45.800,00:04:48.590,你上次不是去御膳房,00:04:44.580,00:04:50.200,"I remember you picked up some
cassava starch to make tapioca pearls."
00:04:48.840,00:04:50.550,领了木薯粉做珍珠圆子吗,,,
00:04:51.800,00:04:53.030,去拿些来当点心吧,00:04:50.600,00:04:53.320,You can bring some for dessert.
00:04:56.280,00:04:58.510,小主怎么会突然想吃这个,00:04:54.480,00:04:58.400,My Lady ... why do you desire it all of a sudden?
00:04:59.680,00:05:01.910,上次的事后奴婢觉得晦气,00:04:58.640,00:05:03.060,I thought they were bad luck so I threw them all away.
00:05:02.240,00:05:03.230,就全拿去扔掉了,,,
00:05:05.480,00:05:06.270,这么巧,00:05:04.180,00:05:07.160,What a shame ...
00:05:09.240,00:05:10.670,我正想着这个味呢,00:05:07.300,00:05:10.800,I was thinking about the taste of it.
00:05:15.120,00:05:17.670,陵容有皇上新赏的栗子糕,00:05:13.700,00:05:18.940,"Lingrong, would you like some chestnut cakes from
His Majesty with a bowl of ""eight treasure porridge""?"
00:05:18.080,00:05:19.710,再来一碗八宝甜酪好不好,,,
00:05:20.160,00:05:21.390,姐姐拿主意就是了,00:05:18.940,00:05:21.540,"Anything you would like to have, Sourire."
00:05:23.040,00:05:23.710,你去拿吧,00:05:21.800,00:05:25.320,"- Please bring some here.
- Yes."
00:05:24.560,00:05:25.230,是,,,
00:05:47.320,00:05:48.070,拿的什么呀,00:05:45.500,00:05:47.800,What did you bring?
00:05:49.080,00:05:50.670,臣妾新剥的莲子,,,
00:05:51.200,00:05:53.590,皇上成日批折子难免上火,00:05:47.980,00:05:54.320,"I peeled some lianzi [莲子 lotus seeds] for Your Majesty.
It helps to relieve summer heat."
00:05:54.000,00:05:55.310,莲子最能清心,,,
00:05:55.800,00:05:56.790,倒难为你了,,,
00:05:57.840,00:06:00.750,剥这个东西最伤指甲,00:05:54.640,00:06:00.400,"Thank you for doing that. I hope you didn't
hurt your fingernails when peeling them."
00:06:02.440,00:06:04.670,皇上平日喝的都是莲子汤,00:06:01.520,00:06:04.260,Your Majesty usually has dried lotus seeds in soup.
00:06:05.200,00:06:06.230,这新鲜的莲子,,,
00:06:06.880,00:06:08.590,臣妾已经剔除莲心,00:06:04.260,00:06:10.560,"I have removed the cores of the fresh lotus seeds.
They have a special taste."
00:06:09.120,00:06:10.470,别有一番滋味,,,
00:06:14.360,00:06:15.190,果然如此,00:06:11.640,00:06:15.280,Mm ... They do taste special.
00:06:16.920,00:06:18.990,只是这莲子没了莲心,00:06:15.700,00:06:18.789,But the lotus seeds lose flavor without the bitter cores
00:06:19.640,00:06:21.030,倒也少了一番风味,,,
00:06:22.880,00:06:24.390,莲子之心最苦,00:06:21.660,00:06:25.760,"I thought Your Majesty would not appreciate
the heart of lianzi [怜子sympathy for one's child]."
00:06:24.800,00:06:26.110,旁人不能体会,,,
00:06:26.960,00:06:28.270,所以便剔除了,00:06:25.900,00:06:29.460,That was why I removed it.
,,,00:06:30.500,00:06:38.820,"You removed the heart of lianzi [lotus seed] ...
but your heart of lianzi [sympathy] is deep and bitter."
00:06:31.840,00:06:33.430,莲子的心已无,,,
00:06:37.000,00:06:39.590,但你怜子之心却是良苦,,,
00:06:41.600,00:06:44.310,朕早起听老太监们嚼闲话,00:06:40.400,00:06:44.020,I overheard the eunuchs gossiping this morning ...
00:06:45.720,00:06:47.670,说万历朝有位景妃,00:06:44.480,00:06:47.500,about Consort Jing of the Wanli Emperor.
00:06:48.880,00:06:50.830,最喜欢利用亲子争宠,00:06:47.700,00:06:50.560,She is given to using her child to gain the emperor's favor.
00:06:52.160,00:06:55.190,甚至不惜让怀中小儿发热,00:06:50.860,00:06:55.860,"She once made her child feverish
to garner the Emperor's attention."
00:06:55.840,00:06:58.310,引皇帝注意你怎么看,00:06:56.260,00:06:57.660,What do you think?
00:06:59.360,00:07:00.750,臣妾若是万历帝,00:06:57.880,00:07:02.380,"If I were the Wanli Emperor, I would
kill Consort Jing to restore discipline in the palace."
00:07:01.040,00:07:02.750,必定杀死景妃以正宫闱,,,
00:07:04.200,00:07:06.710,十月怀胎一朝临产之苦,00:07:02.920,00:07:07.520,"Only a mother can understand the pain of
carrying a child from conception to birth."
00:07:06.960,00:07:08.590,非为人母不能体会,,,
00:07:09.160,00:07:11.030,景妃她身为人母却害其子,00:07:07.860,00:07:12.900,"A mother would never harm her own child ...
unless Consort Jing was not the birth mother."
00:07:11.840,00:07:13.350,除非不是生母,,,
00:07:15.040,00:07:16.950,景妃若不是有难言之隐,00:07:13.720,00:07:18.420,"Even if she had a good reason,
she did not deserve to live"
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.510,那么便是连为人都不配了,,,
00:07:19.960,00:07:20.870,怎还配活着,,,
00:07:21.360,00:07:25.390,你一向温顺寡言难得这么激愤,00:07:20.080,00:07:25.340,"You are usually soft spoken.
It is rare to hear you talk so indignantly."
00:07:28.480,00:07:29.590,臣妾失言了,00:07:27.200,00:07:29.040,I apologize for my temper.
00:07:30.400,00:07:32.190,只是臣妾也身为人母,00:07:29.200,00:07:32.760,"It's only that as a mother, I couldn't help
having strong feelings about it."
00:07:32.520,00:07:33.750,一时有感而发,,,
00:07:35.560,00:07:36.590,怜子之心,,,
00:07:37.840,00:07:40.790,不仅母亲有 父亲也有,00:07:34.220,00:07:39.960,A father has the same heart of lianzi as the mother.
00:07:43.360,00:07:44.790,难为你剥了这么久,00:07:42.100,00:07:46.080,You put a lot of thought to take out the heart of lianzi.
00:07:47.560,00:07:50.310,你既细心又有耐心,00:07:46.320,00:07:50.420,You are an attentive and patient mother.
00:07:51.960,00:07:53.590,华妃到底没有生养过,00:07:50.740,00:07:53.420,"After all, Concort Fleur has no experience in caring for a baby."
00:07:54.800,00:07:57.750,你自己的孩子 自己带回去带吧,00:07:53.560,00:07:57.720,You should take your child back to your own care.
00:07:59.640,00:08:00.590,谢皇上,00:07:58.320,00:08:00.680,I thank Your Majesty.
00:08:02.280,00:08:04.230,那就赶紧带温宜公主回去吧,00:08:01.080,00:08:03.540,You can take Wenyi home now.
00:08:05.240,00:08:05.990,是,00:08:03.940,00:08:05.820,Yes.
00:08:14.960,00:08:19.270,皇上 奴才看曹贵人挺开心的,00:08:13.820,00:08:19.000,"Your Majesty, Lady Cao seems to be in a good mood."
00:08:20.440,00:08:23.270,怎么倒是皇上您有点不大高兴啊,00:08:19.180,00:08:23.360,But why is Your Majesty looking upset?
00:08:25.560,00:08:27.990,你看见曹贵人去接温宜公主时,00:08:24.380,00:08:27.860,What was Lady Cao like when she left?
00:08:28.320,00:08:29.150,是什么样子,,,
00:08:29.600,00:08:31.590,高兴得就差点没飞起来了,00:08:28.240,00:08:34.440,"Lady Cao was almost flying out of the hall.
She headed straight towards the Cooling Hall."
00:08:31.840,00:08:33.670,直奔华妃娘娘那儿去了,,,
00:08:36.760,00:08:38.990,奴才说错话了 奴才该死,00:08:34.880,00:08:38.160,"Your Majesty, I misspoke.
My offence deserves punishment."
00:08:39.400,00:08:40.670,你说的是实话,00:08:38.280,00:08:40.760,You spoke the truth.
00:08:42.720,00:08:43.910,朕也没看错,00:08:41.500,00:08:43.760,I saw it as well.
00:08:45.440,00:08:46.670,就因为如此,00:08:44.040,00:08:49.120,That is exactly why I'm sorely disappointed
00:08:48.080,00:08:49.430,朕才觉得寒心,,,
00:08:58.720,00:08:59.510,皇上,,,
00:09:00.240,00:09:02.630,华妃娘娘备了您最喜欢的点心,00:08:57.440,00:09:03.200,"Your Majesty, Consort Fleur invites you for some snacks."
00:09:02.920,00:09:04.110,请您过去尝尝,,,
00:09:07.040,00:09:10.350,皇上 今儿的牌子您还没翻呢,00:09:05.800,00:09:09.380,Your Majesty hasn't selected a name tag yet.
00:09:10.920,00:09:13.390,这些天您不去莞贵人那儿,00:09:09.760,00:09:15.760,"Recently, Your Majesty has not visited Lady Sourire
and Attendant An, or even Consort Fleur."
00:09:13.760,00:09:14.790,也不见安常在,,,
00:09:15.080,00:09:16.750,更不去华妃娘娘那儿,00:09:16.200,00:09:17.580,You can leave now.
00:09:17.600,00:09:18.470,你先下去吧,00:09:17.820,00:09:18.900,Yes.
00:09:19.040,00:09:19.710,嗻,,,
00:09:32.120,00:09:32.830,苏培盛,00:09:30.800,00:09:32.280,Su Peisheng.
00:09:35.200,00:09:35.870,奴才在,00:09:33.960,00:09:35.760,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:09:37.480,00:09:39.070,朕有点饿了,00:09:36.180,00:09:38.640,I'm feeling a little hungry.
00:09:40.280,00:09:42.310,那奴才让御膳房送点心来,00:09:39.100,00:09:42.360,"I will ask the Imperial Kitchen to
prepare some snacks for Your Majesty."
00:09:43.880,00:09:46.030,华妃那儿不是有现成的吗,00:09:42.680,00:09:45.000,Didn't Consort Fleur offer some already?
00:09:46.720,00:09:49.110,奴才明白了 皇上请,00:09:45.480,00:09:48.260,"I understand.
I will follow Your Majesty."
00:09:49.920,00:09:51.990,对了你再去告诉莞贵人,00:09:48.940,00:09:54.080,"Also, tell Lady Sourire that I will have
breakfast with her in the morning."
00:09:52.720,00:09:54.950,朕明日到她那儿去用早膳,,,
00:09:55.720,00:09:56.390,嗻,00:09:54.500,00:09:56.180,Yes.
00:10:01.800,00:10:03.790,别磨蹭了 小主都已经起来了,00:10:00.660,00:10:03.300,"Hurry up, My Lady is awake."
00:10:04.680,00:10:06.390,你且去吧 我速速就来,00:10:03.600,00:10:06.040,You go first. I will be there shortly.
00:10:07.440,00:10:09.150,今天皇上要陪小主吃早饭的,00:10:06.220,00:10:08.220,His Majesty is coming to have breakfast with My Lady.
00:10:09.480,00:10:10.750,我先去了你快点啊,00:10:08.220,00:10:11.220,I will go now. Don't take too long.
00:10:27.200,00:10:29.190,我等一下还要去向皇后请安,00:10:26.000,00:10:30.740,"I need to pay my respects to Her Majesty after breakfast.
This hairpin is ostentatious."
00:10:29.600,00:10:30.830,这支步摇太招摇了,,,
00:10:32.360,00:10:33.670,小主也太小心了,00:10:31.000,00:10:33.340,"My Lady, you are overly cautious."
00:10:34.800,00:10:36.350,皇上对安常在的眷顾,,,
00:10:36.640,00:10:37.550,还不如对小主呢,00:10:33.680,00:10:40.240,"Although Attendant An is not as favored as you,
she always adorns herself with pretentious jewelry."
00:10:38.080,00:10:39.710,她还不是成日的花枝招展,,,
00:10:40.280,00:10:41.230,珠翠满头的,,,
00:10:42.440,00:10:44.110,安常在再珠玉满头,00:10:41.000,00:10:44.680,"Attendant An does not exceed
the norms of her status wearing jewelry."
00:10:44.360,00:10:45.590,却也没有越过她的本分,00:10:44.980,00:10:47.240,You'd better not talk like this again.
00:10:46.800,00:10:47.790,这话别再说了,,,
00:10:48.760,00:10:50.430,叫爱搬弄是非的人听去了,00:10:47.460,00:10:52.020,A prying ear might hear that and think I don't desire her to fare well.
00:10:51.040,00:10:52.510,还以为我见不得陵容好呢,,,
00:10:53.600,00:10:54.310,是,00:10:52.340,00:10:54.940,"Yes, My Lady."
00:10:57.800,00:11:00.070,安常在也没多美,00:10:56.000,00:11:01.540,Attendant An is not very beautiful or well born.
00:11:00.960,00:11:02.230,家世也算不上好,,,
00:11:03.280,00:11:04.750,皇上怎么那么喜欢她,00:11:02.000,00:11:04.000,I wonder why His Majesty is so fond of her.
00:11:05.600,00:11:07.190,就因为她歌唱得好早,00:11:04.000,00:11:06.300,Is it only for her beautiful voice?
00:11:07.880,00:11:09.870,承恩不在貌也无关家世,00:11:06.400,00:11:09.320,His Majesty favors a concubine regardless of her face or family.
00:11:10.360,00:11:11.590,只看皇上是否中意,00:11:09.320,00:11:11.020,All that matters is whether His Majesty likes her.
00:11:12.440,00:11:13.630,要不然也是枉然,00:11:11.180,00:11:14.420,"Otherwise, any effort would be futile."
00:11:16.120,00:11:18.110,你近日说话怎么总是冒冒失失的,00:11:15.000,00:11:17.600,Lately you've been reckless in your speech.
00:11:19.160,00:11:20.830,谨慎妥帖是你的长处,00:11:17.780,00:11:22.280,Prudence was always one of your merits. Remember that.
00:11:21.440,00:11:23.030,好好揣着可别丢了,,,
00:11:24.240,00:11:26.230,皇上昨日嘱咐了,00:11:23.000,00:11:27.040,"His Majesty bids you to have breakfast with him, My Lady."
00:11:26.520,00:11:27.990,要和小主一同用早膳,,,
00:11:28.520,00:11:30.630,小主应该打扮得鲜艳些才是,00:11:27.380,00:11:30.240,You should wear brighter colors.
00:11:32.680,00:11:34.190,你今日打扮得倒鲜艳,00:11:30.600,00:11:33.780,"Well, you are brightly adorned today."
00:11:35.760,00:11:37.830,小主忘了今日是中元节,00:11:34.000,00:11:37.040,"My Lady, today is the Zhong Yuan Festival [Ghost Festival] ."
00:11:38.360,00:11:39.550,中元节阴气重,00:11:37.280,00:11:41.580,Bright colors balance the strong yin of the day.
00:11:40.360,00:11:42.510,奴婢打扮得鲜艳一点压压日子,,,
00:11:43.240,00:11:45.710,果然呢 今儿是中元节,00:11:42.000,00:11:46.400,"Ah, today is Zhong Yuan Festival."
00:11:48.880,00:11:51.390,今夜宫里要作法事祭鬼神,00:11:47.500,00:11:50.440,There will be rituals on the lake tonight.
00:11:51.920,00:11:54.230,在御湖里要烧法船 放祭品,00:11:50.680,00:11:53.500,"Paper ships will be burned and
sacrifices will be offered for our ancestors."
00:11:54.840,00:11:57.230,你也去一趟吧 算是尽尽孝心,00:11:53.740,00:11:57.280,You should attend the rituals to accomplish your filial duty. [The festival honors deceased relatives]
00:11:58.920,00:11:59.710,多谢小主,00:11:57.760,00:11:59.760,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:12:02.520,00:12:03.270,流朱,00:12:01.460,00:12:03.220,Vermilion.
00:12:07.000,00:12:07.590,你去看看,00:12:05.720,00:12:07.840,Please go check out the food in the kitchen.
00:12:07.960,00:12:09.150,小厨房的菜做得怎么样了,,,
00:12:09.400,00:12:10.150,我叮嘱过他们,00:12:08.180,00:12:11.000,I told them the food must be delicious and delicate.
00:12:10.520,00:12:11.510,要做得精致可口些,,,
00:12:12.200,00:12:12.870,是,00:12:11.000,00:12:13.000,Yes.
00:12:17.720,00:12:19.550,皇上这些日子辛苦了,00:12:16.580,00:12:18.680,Your Majesty has been working very hard.
00:12:20.280,00:12:22.190,臣妾已经让人熬好了参汤,00:12:19.000,00:12:21.580,I have ordered them to make ginseng soup.
00:12:23.160,00:12:25.870,等皇上下朝之后就可以喝了,00:12:21.940,00:12:25.140,It will be ready after court.
00:12:27.120,00:12:28.670,你服侍朕也辛苦了,00:12:25.900,00:12:27.660,Thank you for getting up early with me.
00:12:29.000,00:12:30.030,可以再睡一会儿,00:12:27.800,00:12:29.300,You should go back to sleep.
00:12:30.440,00:12:33.470,参汤让他们送到勤政殿就是了,00:12:29.400,00:12:32.720,You can ask them to send the soup to the Governance Hall.
00:12:34.480,00:12:37.710,那臣妾等着皇上用午膳,00:12:33.260,00:12:37.000,If so ... I will await Your Majesty to have lunch together.
00:12:38.360,00:12:41.190,前朝事多 朕明日再来陪你,00:12:37.440,00:12:40.700,I am very busy today. I will visit you tomorrow.
00:12:47.160,00:12:48.270,臣妾还以为,,,
00:12:49.120,00:12:51.150,皇上因为温宜公主的事情,00:12:45.920,00:12:51.560,I thought Your Majesty was angry with me about Princess Wenyi.
00:12:51.520,00:12:52.710,生臣妾的气,,,
00:12:53.560,00:12:54.790,再也不来了呢,00:12:51.720,00:12:54.760,I thought you did not want to see me again.
00:12:56.440,00:12:57.350,傻话,00:12:55.280,00:12:57.660,Don't be silly.
00:12:59.040,00:12:59.790,对了,,,
00:13:00.280,00:13:02.590,昨日你哥哥上了个请安折子,00:12:58.020,00:13:04.540,"Oh, your brother was asking about you
in his memorandum yesterday."
00:13:03.160,00:13:04.510,还问及你安好,,,
00:13:06.320,00:13:08.990,哥哥还像小时候一样记挂着臣妾,00:13:05.000,00:13:08.420,My brother's care for me has not wavered since we were children.
00:13:09.680,00:13:11.230,臣妾也记挂着哥哥,00:13:08.600,00:13:10.840,I'm always concerned for him as well.
00:13:12.480,00:13:14.750,不知哥哥的旧伤好些了吗,00:13:11.280,00:13:13.840,I wonder if his old injuries got better.
00:13:15.480,00:13:18.030,兄妹情深这是自然的,00:13:14.420,00:13:17.720,Siblings should always care for each other.
00:13:19.920,00:13:22.470,朕已经告诉他你一切安好,00:13:18.000,00:13:22.240,I have replied to him that everything's good with you.
00:13:22.800,00:13:23.710,叫他放心,,,
00:13:24.240,00:13:25.350,至于他的伤痛,,,
00:13:25.920,00:13:27.110,朕知道你挂心,00:13:23.000,00:13:28.500,"And I also asked about his injuries and
sent some medicine to him on your behalf."
00:13:27.600,00:13:29.710,已经替你问候还赐了药,,,
00:13:32.040,00:13:33.270,多谢皇上关心,00:13:30.000,00:13:33.400,Ah ... I am grateful for Your Majesty's care and consideration.
00:13:35.160,00:13:37.950,皇上 今夜是中元节,00:13:34.000,00:13:38.920,"Your Majesty, since we are performing rituals
for Zhong Yuan Festival,"
00:13:38.680,00:13:40.070,晚上要作法事,,,
00:13:40.280,00:13:43.110,臣妾已经让人准备了烧些东西,00:13:39.140,00:13:45.000,"I have prepared paper offerings for
the soldiers who died on the battlefield."
00:13:43.760,00:13:46.190,以安慰沙场战死的将士亡魂,00:13:46.000,00:13:49.000,Let the the priests guide their souls to the Pure Land.
00:13:47.840,00:13:50.230,让法师替他们超度吧,00:13:49.360,00:13:52.740,Mm. I appreciate that.
00:13:52.120,00:13:56.430,难得你如此体贴 朕就安心了,00:13:53.000,00:13:56.000,I'm glad that you are so considerate. (laughs)
00:14:01.160,00:14:02.550,臣妾恭送皇上,00:14:00.160,00:14:02.740,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:14:02.920,00:14:03.750,恭送皇上,,,
00:14:04.040,00:14:05.790,皇上驾到,00:14:03.620,00:14:05.620,His Majesty the Emperor.
,,,00:14:05.960,00:14:08.040,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:14:07.320,00:14:09.190,皇上万福金安,00:14:08.040,00:14:09.920,"- Rise.
- I thank Your Majesty."
00:14:09.440,00:14:10.110,都起来吧,,,
00:14:10.480,00:14:11.030,谢皇上,,,
00:14:11.240,00:14:12.430,刚下朝朕也饿了,00:14:10.000,00:14:12.400,I am hungry after court.
00:14:14.240,00:14:16.390,今儿有上好的风腌小菜,00:14:13.000,00:14:18.320,"I received some delicious pickles
and had them sent to your kitchen."
00:14:17.040,00:14:19.350,朕已经叫人送到你的小厨房去了,,,
00:14:20.040,00:14:21.790,配上粥 咱们一块儿吃,00:14:18.880,00:14:21.520,Let's have some with the porridge.
00:14:23.200,00:14:25.710,这是一早新磨的豆浆皇上尝尝,00:14:22.000,00:14:25.500,"Your Majesty, have some soy milk -
we made it this morning."
00:14:28.360,00:14:29.870,皇上似乎很高兴的样子,00:14:26.000,00:14:30.040,"Your Majesty looks very pleased.
Is there any good news?"
00:14:30.200,00:14:31.270,可是有什么高兴的事,,,
00:14:31.520,00:14:34.910,年羹尧大破敌军 西北战事告捷,00:14:30.200,00:14:34.100,Nian Gengyao has won a sweeping victory in the Northwest.
00:14:35.560,00:14:37.270,朕心很是安慰,00:14:34.320,00:14:36.620,I'm very relieved.
00:14:38.080,00:14:40.190,皇上天纵英明运筹帷幄,00:14:36.780,00:14:39.620,"It couldn't have been achieved without Your Majesty's
strategic planning and leadership."
00:14:40.920,00:14:43.670,臣妾以粥代酒相贺,00:14:40.000,00:14:42.820,"I congratulate Your Majesty with
this bowl of porridge instead of wine."
00:14:44.320,00:14:46.670,你以为这样就能逃得了喝酒了吗,00:14:43.240,00:14:46.300,You think you can escape wine with that?
00:14:47.600,00:14:49.190,皇上可不能强人所难啊,00:14:46.500,00:14:49.140,Your Majesty can't force me to drink.
00:14:53.120,00:14:55.590,到了月底就要回京城了,00:14:51.700,00:14:57.500,"We will go back to the palace by the end of this month.
It will be a busy time for the empress."
00:14:56.600,00:14:57.470,诸事烦琐,,,
00:14:59.080,00:15:01.510,朕恐怕皇后心力难支,00:14:57.800,00:15:03.360,"I am afraid she will be exhausted.
I'm considering having Consort Fleur assist her."
00:15:02.640,00:15:04.430,想让华妃从旁协助一二,,,
00:15:05.080,00:15:05.990,你觉得如何,00:15:03.720,00:15:06.080,What do you think?
00:15:08.360,00:15:10.430,那皇后娘娘是怎么个意思呢,00:15:07.200,00:15:09.740,What does Her Majesty think?
00:15:11.280,00:15:14.750,朕还没有问过皇后先来问问你,00:15:09.900,00:15:13.720,"I haven't talked to her about it.
I came to you first."
00:15:16.240,00:15:17.550,皇上体恤华妃,00:15:15.000,00:15:18.940,"There's nothing improper with Your Majesty
trusting Consort Fleur with this task."
00:15:18.480,00:15:19.990,自然没有什么不好的,,,
00:15:20.800,00:15:23.830,华妃有时做事的确是急躁,00:15:19.560,00:15:23.140,I have to say that Consort Fleur makes rash decisions sometimes.
00:15:24.880,00:15:28.990,但是端妃病弱 齐妃庸懦,00:15:23.700,00:15:28.140,"But Consort Honnête is unwell
and Consort Astuce is stodgy and timid."
00:15:30.080,00:15:32.790,也就华妃能协助一二,00:15:28.800,00:15:32.500,Consort Fleur is the only one who can help her.
00:15:35.480,00:15:36.830,皇上的心意是好,00:15:34.300,00:15:39.540,"Your Majesty is very considerate.
I believe Her Majesty will not disagree."
00:15:37.640,00:15:38.910,想来皇后娘娘,,,
00:15:39.280,00:15:40.430,也不会有什么异议,,,
00:15:42.120,00:15:44.990,只是年将军前线刚刚告捷,00:15:40.800,00:15:49.180,"The only concern is if Your Majesty restores Consort Fleur's power when General Nian has just won a war,"
00:15:46.000,00:15:47.870,皇上就立刻恢复了,,,
00:15:48.240,00:15:49.910,华妃娘娘协理六宫之权,,,
00:15:51.120,00:15:53.950,知道的自然是说皇上体恤功妾,00:15:50.000,00:15:53.340,"although we understand that Your Majesty
did it out of care for Her Majesty,"
00:15:54.560,00:15:55.470,不知道的,,,
00:15:55.960,00:15:58.710,恐怕会忽略了皇上的英明,00:15:53.500,00:15:57.900,some might misjudge Your Majesty.
00:15:59.960,00:16:01.950,只以为皇上仰仗着年家,00:15:58.800,00:16:02.380,"They might say that Your Majesty simply
relies on the Nian family to win the wars"
00:16:02.320,00:16:03.470,才有胜仗可打,,,
00:16:04.160,00:16:07.550,所以要迫不及待重用华妃,00:16:02.800,00:16:07.420,"and that Your Majesty takes Consort Fleur seriously
only to win over the Nians."
00:16:07.880,00:16:08.830,以做笼络,,,
00:16:09.160,00:16:10.710,宫中竟有这样的闲话,00:16:07.700,00:16:10.600,What nonsense in the palace!
00:16:12.120,00:16:15.190,是那起子糊涂人爱在背后嚼舌根,00:16:10.800,00:16:14.480,Those woodenheads are always fond of gossiping.
00:16:15.800,00:16:17.150,皇上别往心里去,00:16:14.700,00:16:17.120,Your Majesty must not pay attention to it.
00:16:18.480,00:16:19.470,只是一样,,,
00:16:19.880,00:16:23.150,年将军已得高功 自然喜不自胜,00:16:17.300,00:16:22.420,"However, General Nian must have been
overjoyed by the feat of victory."
00:16:24.240,00:16:27.310,若此刻皇上授权于华妃,00:16:23.100,00:16:29.960,"If Your Majesty empowers Consort Fleur right now,
General Nian might be eaten up with pride."
00:16:28.080,00:16:30.870,恐怕年将军会一时高兴而忘了形,,,
00:16:31.440,00:16:32.390,那就不好了,00:16:30.400,00:16:33.320,That would not be good.
00:16:42.320,00:16:44.550,臣妾一时糊涂竟妄议朝政,00:16:40.700,00:16:43.640,I was over my head to pass comment on  state affairs.
00:16:45.000,00:16:45.990,还请皇上恕罪,00:16:43.800,00:16:46.680,I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:17:01.080,00:17:04.030,无妨 朕说过许你议政,00:16:59.820,00:17:05.580,It's all right. I have given you permission to talk about governance.
00:17:07.840,00:17:09.910,只怕这宫里除了你,00:17:06.400,00:17:12.440,"I'm afraid no one else in the palace dares to
discuss the pros and cons like you."
00:17:10.520,00:17:13.150,没人再敢与朕这样分析利弊,,,
00:17:14.800,00:17:16.110,臣妾今日说这话,00:17:13.700,00:17:17.960,I didn't say it out of jealousy of Her Highness.
00:17:16.800,00:17:18.270,并非是妒忌华妃娘娘,,,
00:17:19.480,00:17:22.070,而是希望皇上能权衡利弊,00:17:18.200,00:17:24.000,"I hope Your Majesty will reconsider and
postpone the resumption of Consort Fleur's power."
00:17:22.480,00:17:24.910,暂缓恢复华妃娘娘协理六宫之权,,,
00:17:26.080,00:17:28.270,一则以平物议,00:17:25.000,00:17:27.940,"This will not only quiet down the gossip,"
00:17:29.400,00:17:31.590,二来不损皇上天威,00:17:28.200,00:17:31.580,"but also maintain the authority of Your Majesty,"
00:17:33.160,00:17:36.510,三来等大节庆时再行加封,00:17:31.900,00:17:39.320,"and it's more justifiable to confer a title
on Her Highness on a major festival."
00:17:37.040,00:17:39.190,便可名正言顺 水到渠成,,,
00:17:42.240,00:17:44.390,今儿是中元不吉利,00:17:41.000,00:17:44.680,"Today is Zhongyuan Festival, an ominous day."
00:17:46.280,00:17:47.910,中秋近在眼前,00:17:45.200,00:17:50.140,"Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching,
and New Year follows after."
00:17:49.320,00:17:50.830,接下去就是除夕,,,
00:17:51.640,00:17:53.110,新岁不宜加封,00:17:50.600,00:17:53.720,But New Year is not appropriate for conferrals...
00:17:56.600,00:17:57.870,只怕要等到元宵,00:17:55.500,00:17:58.520,"we might have to wait until Lantern Festival
[the end of Spring Festival]."
00:17:59.960,00:18:01.510,到那时再说也不迟,00:17:58.700,00:18:00.500,It's not too late to do it next year ...
00:18:03.040,00:18:06.390,这样也好 只是辛苦了皇后,00:18:02.000,00:18:06.280,"It's all right, just too much work for the Empress."
00:18:08.080,00:18:09.310,皇上无须担忧,00:18:07.000,00:18:08.860,Your Majesty need not worry.
00:18:10.200,00:18:12.670,皇后娘娘熟悉六宫事务,00:18:09.000,00:18:12.200,Her Majesty is familiar with the palace affairs.
00:18:14.040,00:18:15.790,还有齐妃敬嫔相助,00:18:12.800,00:18:18.000,"Everything will be all right with the assistance from
Consort Astuce and Concubine Estime."
00:18:16.560,00:18:18.190,想来也不会有什么差池,,,
00:18:22.440,00:18:24.510,其实眉姐姐为贵人时,00:18:21.400,00:18:26.640,"When Meizhuang was a Noble Lady,
Your Majesty was very appreciative of her."
00:18:25.240,00:18:26.990,皇上还是属意于她的,,,
00:18:28.480,00:18:30.350,有意让她学习六宫事务,00:18:27.400,00:18:33.320,Your Majesty permitted her to learn about palace management to potentially help Her Majesty with the chores.
00:18:31.000,00:18:34.310,以便将来帮皇后娘娘周全琐事,,,
00:18:35.680,00:18:37.270,只是现在可惜了,00:18:34.520,00:18:36.000,It is a pity that now ...
00:18:37.520,00:18:38.550,刘畚还没有抓到,00:18:36.000,00:18:38.260,Liu Ben is still at large.
00:18:39.680,00:18:42.110,先让她好好静心修德才是,00:18:38.700,00:18:41.380,She needs to reflect on her mistake and cultivate virtue.
00:18:42.560,00:18:44.750,是 只要抓到了刘畚,00:18:41.680,00:18:47.000,"Yes, justice will be done for Meizhuang once Liu Ben is arrested."
00:18:45.160,00:18:47.070,眉姐姐的冤枉便可辩白了,,,
00:18:49.120,00:18:49.910,起来吧,00:18:47.640,00:18:49.200,You may rise.
00:18:51.160,00:18:51.950,谢皇上,00:18:49.280,00:18:51.900,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:57.280,00:18:58.710,皇上说了那会子话,00:18:55.840,00:18:59.140,Your Majesty must be thirsty after talking for a while.
00:18:59.400,00:19:01.990,肯定口渴了喝碗豆浆吧,00:18:59.360,00:19:03.480,Would you like some soy milk?
,,,00:19:08.400,00:19:10.320,Allow me.
00:19:09.480,00:19:12.470,我来皇上请用,00:19:10.320,00:19:12.500,"Your Majesty, please."
00:19:17.440,00:19:19.710,打扮得甚是俊俏,00:19:16.140,00:19:18.940,You are dressed quite smartly today.
00:19:21.120,00:19:21.990,多谢皇上,00:19:19.080,00:19:20.940,I thank your Majesty.
00:19:22.600,00:19:23.670,绿裙娇俏,,,
00:19:24.400,00:19:27.030,只是用粉红花朵点缀,00:19:21.080,00:19:26.780,"Your green dress is fine and delicate, but it looks
rather gaudy with a pink flower ..."
00:19:28.560,00:19:30.990,又着粉鞋未免俗气,00:19:27.300,00:19:29.740,and pink shoes.
00:19:37.680,00:19:39.550,我刚新得了一匹粉红绸缎,00:19:36.360,00:19:40.320,"I just received a piece of pink satin.
You can make a dress with it."
00:19:40.000,00:19:41.230,你拿去做身衣服吧,,,
00:19:41.760,00:19:43.390,把这身绿衣服给换下来吧,00:19:40.660,00:19:43.560,It will look better than this green dress.
00:19:45.880,00:19:46.710,多谢小主,00:19:44.700,00:19:46.820,"Thank you so much, My Lady."
00:19:48.440,00:19:49.550,那奴婢就告退了,00:19:47.080,00:19:50.000,Allow me to take my leave.
00:19:52.360,00:19:53.590,你对下人倒是好,00:19:50.780,00:19:54.000,You are very kind to your servants.
00:19:55.680,00:19:58.270,她们在宫中为奴为婢本就辛苦,00:19:54.540,00:19:57.040,Their lives are already tough as servants in the palace.
00:19:58.560,00:19:59.710,我若再不对她们好,00:19:57.300,00:20:00.420,I must be nice to them to make their life easier.
00:20:00.040,00:20:01.110,实在是太可怜了,00:20:00.540,00:20:01.760,I agree.
00:20:01.480,00:20:02.230,也是,,,
00:20:03.800,00:20:06.070,一旦奴才心有怨恨,00:20:02.560,00:20:10.400,"The servants will not fulfill their duty
if they hold any grudge against you."
00:20:07.240,00:20:10.310,主子吩咐下去的事也不会做好,,,
00:20:14.040,00:20:14.750,启禀皇上,,,
00:20:15.400,00:20:18.230,军机众臣们已在御书房等候着了,00:20:12.840,00:20:17.840,"Your Majesty, the military officials
have been waiting at the Imperial Study."
00:20:22.280,00:20:24.670,那朕先回去 明日再来看你,00:20:20.600,00:20:25.140,I have to go now. I will see you tomorrow.
00:20:31.440,00:20:32.870,臣妾恭送皇上,00:20:29.960,00:20:32.360,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:20:45.720,00:20:47.670,怎么这一大早的就让本王看见,00:20:43.380,00:20:48.060,"I didn't expect to see such a beautiful scene of raindrops
falling from pear blossoms [a weeping beauty]."
00:20:47.960,00:20:49.590,这梨花带雨的美景啊,00:20:48.740,00:20:50.700,Peace to Noble Prince Guo.
00:20:50.160,00:20:51.030,果郡王吉祥,,,
00:20:51.320,00:20:54.110,起来吧 你是哪儿的宫女啊,00:20:51.040,00:20:53.600,You may rise. Which palace are you from?
00:20:55.000,00:20:56.710,我是莞贵人的陪嫁侍女,00:20:53.900,00:20:56.500,I am Lady Sourire's dowry maid.
00:20:58.560,00:20:59.910,谢郡王刚才美言,00:20:57.160,00:20:59.340,I thank Your Lordship for your kind words.
00:21:00.400,00:21:03.590,只不过红配绿的梨花俗气得很,00:20:59.420,00:21:03.180,"However, a pear blossom wearing green with pink is not appreciated."
00:21:04.960,00:21:05.830,谁说你俗气了,00:21:03.640,00:21:05.400,Who said so?
00:21:06.920,00:21:08.030,就是有人说的,00:21:05.720,00:21:07.500,Somebody just did.
00:21:08.840,00:21:11.230,他不喜欢红配绿所以觉得不好看,00:21:07.740,00:21:10.560,"Even if he doesn’t like a flower in green and pink,"
00:21:11.960,00:21:14.750,其实这各花入各眼,00:21:10.820,00:21:14.000,the beauty of a flower is different to each beholder.
00:21:15.240,00:21:17.150,本王就觉得挺好看的,00:21:14.220,00:21:16.520,I think it is quite beautiful.
00:21:20.480,00:21:21.870,王爷不必哄我高兴,00:21:18.980,00:21:20.980,Your Lordship need not to lie to cheer me up.
00:21:22.720,00:21:24.030,本王为什么要哄你高兴,00:21:21.340,00:21:24.400,Why would I lie? I'm telling the truth.
00:21:24.560,00:21:25.470,实话实说,,,
00:21:26.320,00:21:28.870,你若不信去看那春日里的花朵,00:21:25.080,00:21:28.040,You can look at the spring flowers if you don't believe me.
00:21:29.600,00:21:31.430,大多数都是红花绿叶的,00:21:28.400,00:21:30.980,Most of them are in pink colors with green leaves.
00:21:31.720,00:21:33.430,人人还说美得很,00:21:31.160,00:21:33.840,And everyone thinks they are beautiful.
00:21:35.440,00:21:36.670,王爷真会取笑,00:21:34.360,00:21:35.940,Your Lordship teases me.
00:21:37.000,00:21:38.830,人好看穿什么都好看,00:21:36.060,00:21:38.220,You are beautiful no matter what you wear.
00:21:39.480,00:21:40.590,若是腹中有诗书,00:21:38.380,00:21:41.540,You will be even more extraordinary if you are educated.
00:21:40.880,00:21:42.150,这气度就更不平凡,,,
00:21:42.960,00:21:44.150,你跟着你们家小主,00:21:41.920,00:21:45.380,You will learn a lot from Lady Sourire.

00:21:44.680,00:21:45.750,自然是不会差的,,,
00:21:55.640,00:21:58.470,小主 浣碧刚才哭着跑出去了,00:21:54.580,00:21:58.460,"My Lady, Jade was crying when she ran out.
And she still hasn't come back."
00:21:58.760,00:21:59.590,现在还没回来,00:21:58.780,00:22:00.380,Let her be.
00:22:00.160,00:22:00.830,由着她去,,,
00:22:03.160,00:22:03.870,下去吧,00:22:01.840,00:22:03.820,"You may go, Vermillion."
00:22:12.240,00:22:13.550,也难怪小主生气,00:22:11.080,00:22:13.060,"I understand why you are upset, My Lady."
00:22:14.280,00:22:17.790,这外人也就算了最怕家贼难防,00:22:13.300,00:22:16.780,"A thief living in the house is
much more dangerous than an intruder."
00:22:19.000,00:22:20.070,你也瞧出来了,00:22:17.540,00:22:19.540,You noticed it as well?
00:22:22.000,00:22:23.110,恕奴婢多嘴,,,
00:22:23.880,00:22:24.870,刚才席间,00:22:20.940,00:22:27.280,"My Lady, pardon my saying that
Jade was acting too obtrusively at the table."
00:22:25.600,00:22:28.270,这浣碧姑娘也未免太伶俐了些,,,
00:22:31.800,00:22:33.310,难为你这么心细,00:22:30.960,00:22:35.780,"I appreciate your thoughtfulness.
Not everyone is aware of that."
00:22:33.960,00:22:36.550,只怕旁人还被蒙在鼓里呢,,,
00:22:38.280,00:22:39.630,我对她并非不好,00:22:37.120,00:22:40.640,"I treat her as my own sister,
but she couldn't wait to stand out."
00:22:40.160,00:22:41.430,她竟然这样按捺不住,,,
00:22:43.040,00:22:45.470,那绸缎小主还要赏给浣碧姑娘吗,00:22:41.980,00:22:44.660,"My Lady, are you still going to reward her the satin?"
00:22:45.640,00:22:47.470,赏自然要赏,00:22:45.280,00:22:46.900,Of course I will.
00:22:48.080,00:22:49.790,你再把我妆台上那串珍珠项链,00:22:47.100,00:22:49.880,Along with the pearl necklace on my dresser.
00:22:50.040,00:22:50.830,一并给了她,,,
00:22:51.960,00:22:53.870,皇上摆明了没有把她放入眼里,00:22:50.880,00:22:53.180,His Majesty apparently shows no interest in her.
00:22:54.320,00:22:56.710,我倒要看看她还能生出什么事来,00:22:53.360,00:22:55.960,I can't wait to see what she will wear next time!
00:22:57.320,00:22:58.070,是,00:22:56.260,00:22:57.260,Yes.
00:23:00.920,00:23:04.750,我估摸着勤政殿曹琴默生事,00:22:59.940,00:23:06.420,"I suspect that Jade has something to do with
the trouble Cao Qinmo gave me at the Governance Hall."
00:23:06.080,00:23:07.670,多半是她走漏的风声,,,
00:23:09.040,00:23:10.590,恐怕连这次温宜公主的事,00:23:07.880,00:23:11.260,And even the illness of Princess Wenyi.
00:23:10.920,00:23:11.990,也脱不了她的干系,,,
00:23:13.520,00:23:14.430,那木薯粉,00:23:12.600,00:23:15.840,"She was the one who brought back
the cassava starch, wasn't she?"
00:23:15.160,00:23:17.150,不就是她自作主张拿回来的吗,,,
00:23:17.520,00:23:21.510,是啊人心难测,00:23:16.460,00:23:20.600,Yes ... (sigh) it's hard to see into a person.
00:23:22.000,00:23:24.910,只是不知道现在与她相与的,00:23:20.960,00:23:26.560,I'm wondering whether she's sided with Consort Fleur or Lady Cao.
00:23:25.200,00:23:27.870,到底是华妃呢还是曹贵人,,,
00:23:30.640,00:23:32.510,我瞧着华妃不会直接见她,00:23:29.700,00:23:32.240,"In my view, Consort Fleur wouldn't deal with her directly."
00:23:33.680,00:23:34.990,多半是通过曹贵人,00:23:32.540,00:23:34.340,It must be Lady Cao.
00:23:36.920,00:23:37.750,这丫头,,,
00:23:38.840,00:23:40.550,原本也是冤孽,00:23:35.880,00:23:42.800,This girl ... born low but aims high.
00:23:41.840,00:23:43.910,只是她的心未免太高了,,,
00:23:44.560,00:23:46.670,白白辜负了我对她的一番打算,00:23:43.540,00:23:46.520,She wasted all my consideration for her future.
00:23:49.720,00:23:52.310,你把东西给她时别露了风声,00:23:48.660,00:23:51.880,Act as if nothing happened when you give her the rewards
00:23:53.320,00:23:55.550,以免她一时愧急做出什么事来,00:23:52.040,00:23:54.740,in case she does something out of guilt.
00:23:56.360,00:23:57.030,奴婢明白,00:23:55.180,00:23:56.840,"I understand, My Lady."
00:23:58.520,00:24:01.230,贱人 竟敢误本宫,00:23:58.620,00:24:00.780,That bitch dares to impede me!
00:24:02.120,00:24:03.230,娘娘不要生气,00:24:01.060,00:24:02.560,Your Highness need not be angry.
00:24:03.600,00:24:05.150,皇上既然有意恢复,00:24:02.760,00:24:07.400,"His Majesty intends to reinstate your
authority to assist in palace affairs, it's just a matter of time."
00:24:05.480,00:24:06.870,娘娘协理六宫之权,,,
00:24:07.160,00:24:08.630,就不怕再等些时候,,,
00:24:08.880,00:24:10.590,莞贵人能阻挠一次,00:24:07.720,00:24:11.780,"Lady Sourire could stop Your Highness once,
but will she be able to interfere again?"
00:24:11.000,00:24:12.390,难道还能阻挠两次,,,
00:24:14.160,00:24:15.510,上次温宜的事,00:24:13.200,00:24:17.500,I wonder if His Majesty has suspicions about Wenyi's illness.
00:24:16.680,00:24:18.430,不知皇上是否疑心本宫,,,
00:24:19.120,00:24:21.270,才会听了甄嬛这个贱人怂恿,00:24:17.800,00:24:20.500,That's why His Majesty would listen to that bitch Zhen Huan.
00:24:21.680,00:24:22.830,娘娘不要多心,00:24:20.560,00:24:22.240,Your Highness must not worry.
00:24:23.640,00:24:25.870,如今处大将军接连打了胜仗,00:24:22.580,00:24:24.800,General Nian has just won a succession of battles.
00:24:26.200,00:24:27.750,皇上高兴还来不及呢,00:24:25.120,00:24:28.800,"Nothing else could make His Majesty happier.
Why would His Majesty be suspicious?"
00:24:28.040,00:24:29.470,怎么会疑心娘娘呢,,,
00:24:32.600,00:24:34.550,皇上近日常来本宫这儿,00:24:31.780,00:24:37.140,"His Majesty has been visiting me frequently.
Was that because of my brother?"
00:24:36.080,00:24:37.870,不是因为哥哥的缘故吧,,,
00:24:40.080,00:24:41.830,娘娘越说越多心了,00:24:38.660,00:24:41.200,Your Highness is overthinking.
00:24:42.600,00:24:45.510,皇上来咱们这儿是最平常的事了,00:24:41.560,00:24:44.520,Nothing is more common than seeing His Majesty in our palace.
00:24:46.080,00:24:47.150,这也足可以见,,,
00:24:47.560,00:24:49.510,皇上并未因为上次的事,00:24:44.900,00:24:49.940,"This is evidence enough to see that
His Majesty has always trusted Your Highness."
00:24:49.840,00:24:50.870,疑心娘娘啊,,,
00:24:52.440,00:24:53.510,是了,00:24:51.480,00:24:52.960,That's true.
00:24:54.440,00:24:56.750,皇上这次不许本宫协理六宫之权,00:24:53.180,00:24:56.820,I don't mind if His Majesty does not resume my authority.
00:24:57.120,00:24:58.030,又如何,,,
00:24:59.200,00:25:01.110,若是皇上这次许了,00:24:57.640,00:25:03.960,"If His Majesty does, it will look like it is
because of my brother rather than me."
00:25:01.720,00:25:04.950,多半是因为哥哥的缘故而非本宫,,,
00:25:06.200,00:25:09.590,皇上不许才见得对本宫好,00:25:05.140,00:25:08.660,His Majesty postponed because he cares for me.
00:25:10.480,00:25:12.950,真真是因为多处的夫妻情深,00:25:09.320,00:25:14.660,"His Majesty empowers me because I'm his wife,
not because of an external relative."
00:25:13.840,00:25:15.070,而非外戚之故,,,
00:25:16.160,00:25:18.110,对呀 所以娘娘您啊,00:25:15.200,00:25:19.020,"Exactly, Your Highness should feel completely at ease."
00:25:18.360,00:25:19.950,就放一百二十个心吧,,,
00:25:25.520,00:25:26.230,姐姐,00:25:24.520,00:25:26.340,Cao
00:25:28.680,00:25:31.430,妹妹怎么过来了 真是难得,00:25:27.720,00:25:30.960,"It’s so rare to have you over, Sourire!"
00:25:33.640,00:25:35.870,早说温宜公主跟着姐姐回来了,00:25:32.680,00:25:35.100,I heard that Princess Wenyi is back.
00:25:36.400,00:25:37.470,我很想念温宜,00:25:35.560,00:25:38.480,I missed her very much so I dropped by.
00:25:37.760,00:25:39.110,所以特地过来看看,,,
00:25:40.080,00:25:41.470,姐姐不会不欢迎吧,00:25:38.960,00:25:40.940,I hope I'm welcomed here.
00:25:42.000,00:25:42.870,哪儿的话呀,,,
00:25:43.160,00:25:45.670,我日夜都盼着妹妹能过来坐坐,00:25:41.060,00:25:45.100,"You must be joking, Sourire.
I have always hoped to have you over."
00:25:47.720,00:25:48.750,就是怕呀,,,
00:25:49.600,00:25:52.950,妹妹还为了上次姐姐做的糊涂事,00:25:46.520,00:25:52.920,"I'm just afraid that you would still be mad
about the foolish mistake I made."
00:25:53.280,00:25:54.270,而生气呢,,,
00:25:54.520,00:25:55.910,我就怕姐姐还耿耿于怀,00:25:53.280,00:25:56.720,"I am worried that you would still be holding on to that.
That's why I am here."
00:25:56.280,00:25:57.190,所以特地过来,,,
00:25:57.880,00:25:59.950,我与姐姐共同侍奉皇上,00:25:56.900,00:25:59.280,We serve His Majesty as a family.
00:26:00.360,00:26:02.030,原本不该分彼此才好,00:25:59.280,00:26:04.500,No miscommunication should stand between us sisters.
00:26:02.480,00:26:03.790,怎能因小小误会,,,
00:26:04.120,00:26:05.390,而伤了彼此情分呢,00:26:04.740,00:26:06.360,Exactly.
00:26:05.840,00:26:06.950,正是这话呢,,,
00:26:07.560,00:26:10.310,姐姐虽年长妹妹几岁,00:26:06.720,00:26:11.160,"Although I am few years older than you,
I'm not as wise as you are."
00:26:10.760,00:26:12.110,可却是个糊涂人,,,
00:26:12.680,00:26:15.110,上次听了那些混账东西的话,00:26:11.700,00:26:16.660,I listened to some idiots and caused you so much trouble.
00:26:15.640,00:26:17.830,倒叫妹妹受了那么大的委屈,00:26:16.760,00:26:18.660,I deserve punishment.
00:26:18.320,00:26:19.390,实在该打,,,
00:26:19.840,00:26:21.550,过去的事就不要再提了,00:26:18.820,00:26:21.200,Let bygones be bygones.
00:26:22.720,00:26:25.030,今日突然过来真是冒昧,00:26:21.760,00:26:25.680,"I apologize for barging in.
I hope you don't mind me, Cao."
00:26:25.760,00:26:27.030,还请姐姐不要见怪,00:26:25.780,00:26:27.000,Not at all.
00:26:27.240,00:26:28.030,哪里,00:26:27.300,00:26:28.420,Vermillion.
00:26:28.760,00:26:29.350,流朱,00:26:28.420,00:26:30.560,"Yes, My Lady."
00:26:29.680,00:26:30.390,是,,,
00:26:34.440,00:26:37.710,这是我亲手绣的几件肚兜,00:26:33.620,00:26:38.500,I embroidered these bodices myself for Princess Wenyi.
00:26:38.120,00:26:39.070,给公主用的,,,
00:26:39.680,00:26:42.230,妹妹的针线不好 只是一点心意,00:26:38.500,00:26:43.580,"They are a small token of my regard.
I hope you don't mind my unremarkable needlework."
00:26:42.680,00:26:43.710,姐姐别嫌弃,,,
00:26:44.560,00:26:45.750,还有这胭脂茶粉,00:26:43.600,00:26:47.340,Here is some rouge that Jinxi made in her free time.
00:26:46.200,00:26:48.070,是槿汐闲来时亲手制的,,,
00:26:48.400,00:26:50.070,用来擦脸细腻红润,00:26:47.340,00:26:50.700,"It creates a fine and glowing complexion.
You might want to give it a try."
00:26:50.400,00:26:51.430,姐姐不妨试试,,,
00:26:51.840,00:26:53.430,妹妹真是太有心了,00:26:50.920,00:26:52.960,"How thoughtful you are, Sourire!"
00:26:54.320,00:26:55.670,妹妹好手艺呀,00:26:53.000,00:26:55.120,This is so beautifully done!
00:26:56.080,00:26:59.790,你看看这花儿绣得一看上去,00:26:55.120,00:27:01.120,"Here, look at this flower ...
I could almost smell the sweet scent of it."
00:27:00.120,00:27:01.830,就仿佛能闻到香味了,,,
00:27:03.080,00:27:04.950,这些不过是寻常之物,00:27:02.160,00:27:04.480,These are all commonplace items.
00:27:06.160,00:27:07.870,我还有一物要赠与姐姐,00:27:04.480,00:27:07.680,"I have yet another gift for you, Cao ..."
00:27:08.880,00:27:11.390,只是这里不太方便,00:27:07.680,00:27:11.360,but I'm afraid it's not very appropriate here.
00:27:12.200,00:27:14.070,能否去内室说话,00:27:11.360,00:27:14.020,May I speak to you in the inner chamber?
00:27:16.160,00:27:18.390,好妹妹跟我来,00:27:14.520,00:27:18.220,"Certainly, this way please, Sourire."
00:27:31.800,00:27:34.190,请姐姐务必收下此物,00:27:31.060,00:27:34.060,"You must accept this, Cao."
00:27:35.880,00:27:37.350,妹妹你这是做什么,00:27:34.560,00:27:37.140,"Sourire, why are you doing this?"
00:27:46.200,00:27:48.270,这东西实在太过珍贵了,00:27:45.200,00:27:49.400,"This is too precious a gift.
I must not accept it."
00:27:48.800,00:27:50.150,我是万万不能收下的,00:27:49.500,00:27:51.000,"Please take it back, Sourire."
00:27:50.520,00:27:51.710,妹妹还是拿回去吧,,,
00:27:52.120,00:27:53.710,我本还有话要求姐姐,00:27:51.240,00:27:53.220,I was hoping to ask you a favor.
00:27:54.160,00:27:55.190,姐姐这样一说,00:27:53.220,00:27:56.820,I'm embarrassed to say it if you decline my gift.
00:27:55.680,00:27:56.950,倒让我张不开嘴了,,,
00:27:59.880,00:28:02.150,妹妹既然有话不妨直说,00:27:58.820,00:28:01.000,"You can tell me straight out, Sourire."
00:28:02.720,00:28:05.190,姐姐能帮忙的一定不会推辞,00:28:01.660,00:28:04.560,I will not decline if there's anything I can help you with.
00:28:05.720,00:28:07.990,华妃娘娘高贵典雅,00:28:04.600,00:28:07.680,Her Highness Consort Fleur is distinguished and graceful.
00:28:08.960,00:28:10.550,我内心是钦服已极,00:28:08.000,00:28:10.280,She commands my greatest admiration.
00:28:11.560,00:28:13.830,只是不知怎么了得罪了娘娘,00:28:10.500,00:28:15.240,"But somehow, unintentionally, I have incurred
offense and misunderstanding from Her Highness."
00:28:14.280,00:28:15.790,竟叫娘娘误会于我,,,
00:28:18.000,00:28:20.310,我独自在这宫中弧苦万分,00:28:17.080,00:28:20.040,"I'm pitifully alone in the palace,"
00:28:21.240,00:28:23.070,如今沈答应又被禁足了,00:28:20.500,00:28:25.060,and even more isolated since Companion Shen's confinement.
00:28:23.880,00:28:25.390,我更是弧零零一个了,,,
00:28:26.680,00:28:27.870,还望姐姐垂怜,00:28:25.500,00:28:27.240,"Cao, I beg you would have pity on me."
00:28:28.320,00:28:29.870,妹妹你身受皇上恩宠,00:28:27.300,00:28:31.700,"Sourire, you are deeply favored by His Majesty
and Attendant An is like a sister to you."
00:28:30.400,00:28:32.270,又与安常在情同姐妹,,,
00:28:33.000,00:28:34.830,怎么倒说出这种话来了,00:28:31.800,00:28:34.000,Why would you feel that way?
00:28:35.120,00:28:36.750,皇上不过是瞧着我新鲜,00:28:34.200,00:28:37.560,His Majesty would still visit me for my freshness in the palace.
00:28:37.080,00:28:38.070,便多过来两日,,,
00:28:38.760,00:28:40.150,如今有了安妹妹,00:28:37.700,00:28:42.960,"Now that An is in favor, I dread to think about my status in the future."
00:28:40.720,00:28:43.310,不知将来我要置身何地,,,
00:28:46.360,00:28:49.310,妹妹这话倒说得我伤心,00:28:45.000,00:28:49.160,(sigh) Your words evoke sadness in me.
00:28:50.200,00:28:53.110,可姐姐不也是如此境况吗,00:28:49.160,00:28:52.640,But I'm in no better position.
00:28:53.840,00:28:56.990,我虽说有个温宜也只是个公主,00:28:52.700,00:28:56.660,"Although I have Wenyi, she is a princess after all."
00:28:58.920,00:29:00.950,华妃娘娘信任姐姐,00:28:57.160,00:29:00.700,Her Highness Consort Fleur trusts you.
00:29:01.720,00:29:03.550,还望姐姐在娘娘面前,00:29:00.700,00:29:04.760,I humbly hope you can put in a good word for me.
00:29:03.920,00:29:04.870,多多美言几句,,,
00:29:05.920,00:29:07.790,若能得到娘娘一日照拂,00:29:04.760,00:29:08.980,"I would be infinitely grateful
if Her Highness would bestow grace on me."
00:29:08.320,00:29:09.470,我就感激不尽了,,,
00:29:11.200,00:29:14.070,妹妹这番心意娘娘自会知晓,00:29:10.100,00:29:13.920,Her Highness will understand your feelings in time.
,,,00:29:13.920,00:29:15.800,"However, ..."
00:29:14.840,00:29:18.350,只是此物太过珍贵了,00:29:15.800,00:29:19.060,"this is too valuable, you should take it back."
00:29:18.800,00:29:19.910,你还是收回去吧,,,
00:29:20.200,00:29:22.270,娘娘那儿我会尽力说和,00:29:19.060,00:29:21.940,I will do my best to talk to Her Highness.
00:29:23.360,00:29:24.350,若能如此,00:29:22.460,00:29:26.120,"If so, I will render my humble service to Her Highness and you."
00:29:24.560,00:29:26.630,我愿为娘娘和姐姐效犬马之劳,,,
00:29:30.080,00:29:32.590,这一小盒蜜合香是皇上所赐,00:29:29.040,00:29:34.100,"The Emerald Honey was a gift from His Majesty.
It is an exotic tributary perfume."
00:29:33.240,00:29:34.630,早说是异域的贡品,,,
00:29:35.240,00:29:36.630,统共就这么一小盒,00:29:34.100,00:29:36.780,They only offered a small box of it.
00:29:37.560,00:29:38.830,还望姐姐不嫌弃,00:29:36.780,00:29:38.860,I hope you like it.
00:29:44.360,00:29:45.590,是蜜合香味道,00:29:43.220,00:29:45.380,It's the Emerald Honey.
00:29:46.600,00:29:47.870,只是这香气幽微,00:29:45.500,00:29:49.820,It gives a pleasantly subtle scent.
00:29:48.280,00:29:50.150,不仔细闻还真闻不出来,,,
00:29:51.280,00:29:53.390,这香料果然气味出众,00:29:49.900,00:29:55.760,"That is an extraordinary perfume.
My cuff was scented by just opening the box."
00:29:54.080,00:29:56.310,只打开了一会儿便沾上了气味,,,
00:29:58.720,00:29:59.550,小主刚走,,,
00:29:59.880,00:30:01.590,曹贵人宫里便把小主送的东西,00:29:57.940,00:30:02.320,"My Lady, when you had just left,
Lady Cao's palace discarded your gifts secretly."
00:30:01.960,00:30:02.830,都悄悄丢了出去,,,
00:30:04.200,00:30:05.950,她哪会真心收我东西啊,00:30:02.820,00:30:06.540,Why would she genuinely accept my gift?
00:30:07.480,00:30:08.590,那香料也扔了吗,00:30:06.600,00:30:08.320,Was the perfume discarded too?
00:30:10.880,00:30:12.430,什么香料并没见啊,00:30:09.200,00:30:12.260,Huh? What perfume? I didn't see any.
00:30:13.960,00:30:15.390,没你事了下去吧,00:30:12.400,00:30:15.120,That's all I need to know. You can go now.
00:30:16.360,00:30:17.070,嗻,,,
00:30:20.320,00:30:21.630,小主怎么那么确信,00:30:20.000,00:30:23.580,"My Lady, how were you so sure
that Lady Cao would accept the Emerald Honey?"
00:30:22.040,00:30:23.990,曹贵人会收下这蜜合香呢,,,
00:30:24.680,00:30:25.990,她久在华妃之下,00:30:23.580,00:30:27.680,"She always has to know her place under Consort Fleur,
maintaining a lifestyle strictly appropriate to her rank."
00:30:26.440,00:30:28.270,吃穿用度都恪守本分,,,
00:30:28.840,00:30:30.230,连寝殿都这样简素,00:30:27.680,00:30:32.960,"Looking at her plain chamber, you would know
that she must have never had such a luxury."
00:30:30.720,00:30:32.310,就知道她从未用过,,,
00:30:32.680,00:30:33.710,什么名贵的香料,,,
00:30:34.720,00:30:36.470,何况蜜合香的确难得,00:30:33.200,00:30:35.620,And the Emerald Honey is rare indeed.
00:30:37.200,00:30:39.270,除了皇后娘娘这样不爱香料的人,00:30:36.180,00:30:39.600,"No woman would resist it unless
they dislike perfumes like Her Majesty."
00:30:39.600,00:30:40.790,哪有女子会拒绝呀,,,
00:30:42.440,00:30:43.950,就算她对我再有戒心,00:30:41.300,00:30:45.260,"Although she was on her guard,
she couldn't bear to throw it away."
00:30:44.520,00:30:46.110,也舍不得扔了这盒香料,,,
00:30:46.960,00:30:48.790,放不下荣华富贵的人,00:30:46.000,00:30:49.660,Great prospect belongs to people who can reject opulence.
00:30:49.200,00:30:50.950,就永远成不了大气候,,,
00:30:52.920,00:30:54.870,奴婢跟着小主快一年了,,,
00:30:55.160,00:30:58.070,小主也渐渐地学会猜度人心了,,,
00:30:58.720,00:30:59.990,吃一堑长一智,00:30:58.620,00:31:00.620,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:31:01.120,00:31:02.990,看着眉姐姐吃了这么大的亏,,,
00:31:03.840,00:31:05.070,我还能不害怕吗,,,
00:31:06.520,00:31:07.950,其实小主只要学会,,,
00:31:08.240,00:31:11.030,能猜准皇上的心意就足够了,,,
00:31:11.640,00:31:14.270,在这后宫中想要升,,,
00:31:14.960,00:31:16.990,就必须猜得中皇上的心思,,,
00:31:17.800,00:31:19.870,若想要活就要猜得中,,,
00:31:20.200,00:31:21.270,其他女人的心思,,,
00:31:25.160,00:31:27.110,安排下去的事情都布置好了吗,,,
00:31:27.320,00:31:28.150,布置好了,,,
00:31:28.720,00:31:31.230,奴婢和小允子安排得妥妥当当的,,,
00:31:31.680,00:31:32.950,绝无旁人知晓,,,
00:31:33.560,00:31:34.790,请小主放心好了,,,
00:31:36.080,00:31:36.950,那就好,,,
00:31:38.160,00:31:40.550,别辜负了我这一盒子蜜合香,00:31:37.600,00:31:43.320,"With the books ""perfumed by a red cuff"",
I won't feel the tediousness of work any more."
00:31:41.240,00:31:42.310,当真是宝贝呢,,,
00:31:44.800,00:31:45.590,谁在外头,00:31:44.220,00:31:49.120,"Your Majesty allowed me to visit the Imperial Study.
I must bring in peace of mind."
00:31:52.000,00:31:54.430,小主内务府送了一些首饰来,,,
00:31:54.800,00:31:55.630,你要不要去看看,,,
00:31:56.720,00:31:57.350,知道了,,,
00:31:58.640,00:32:00.670,你挑两件好的送去给安常在,,,
00:32:01.720,00:32:02.790,再转告敬嫔,00:32:00.200,00:32:04.240,"Jade, I'm going to the Leisured Moon Chamber to meet Meizhuang."
00:32:03.280,00:32:05.510,说明天晚上我过去陪她说话,00:32:04.820,00:32:06.900,"My Lady, why did you decide to go all of a sudden?"
00:32:07.000,00:32:07.910,时候不早了,,,
00:32:08.400,00:32:09.590,你的祭品都烧了没有,00:32:07.120,00:32:10.980,His Majesty has ordered that no one shall visit her without permission.
00:32:10.480,00:32:11.430,我正要出去呢,00:32:11.380,00:32:12.880,I have been thinking about her constantly.
00:32:12.520,00:32:15.350,也好早去早回,00:32:13.260,00:32:15.260,I have to ask her about something face to face.
00:32:16.560,00:32:17.750,也替我烧上一份,00:32:16.660,00:32:18.960,"Jade, you are my dowry maid."
00:32:18.240,00:32:19.230,为我尽点心意,00:32:19.380,00:32:20.960,Very few people have seen you in the palace.
00:32:21.160,00:32:21.870,是,00:32:21.140,00:32:25.280,I will pretend to be you and deliver some packages to her with Jinxi.
,,,00:32:26.680,00:32:28.340,I have taken care of the people over there.
,,,00:32:28.600,00:32:31.680,"I will sneak in as the night falls,
when the guards change shifts."
,,,00:32:32.020,00:32:33.640,It will be perfectly safe.
,,,00:32:34.360,00:32:38.140,"But My Lady, you would be guilty of deceiving His Majesty were you caught."
,,,00:32:39.080,00:32:42.880,You are in high favor now and need not take such a risk.
,,,00:32:43.560,00:32:45.380,I will just need to walk with my head down.
,,,00:32:45.400,00:32:46.740,No one will notice.
00:32:45.960,00:32:50.270,娘 女儿已经想尽所有的办法,00:32:47.860,00:32:50.460,I have to make this trip whether in high favor or not.
00:32:51.560,00:32:53.070,但还是得不到所求,00:32:51.240,00:32:54.400,"His Majesty will sleep alone tonight.
I cannot miss this chance."
00:32:55.120,00:32:56.670,我不知道应该怎么办,00:32:57.440,00:32:59.660,"My Lady, please think twice before you go."
00:33:00.160,00:33:03.150,娘 你一辈子为奴为婢,00:33:00.080,00:33:02.060,I know what I'm doing.
,,,00:33:02.700,00:33:04.540,"Jade, you will stay in the chamber."
00:33:04.960,00:33:06.990,还要受汉人身份的限制,00:33:04.740,00:33:06.500,Don't let anyone else see you.
00:33:08.320,00:33:10.310,没有办法得到应有的名分,00:33:07.120,00:33:08.260,Okay.
00:33:12.880,00:33:14.990,连女儿也都只能为奴为婢,00:33:10.100,00:33:11.820,Let's go.
00:33:17.240,00:33:17.990,娘,,,
00:33:20.840,00:33:23.390,为什么我和小主都是爹的女儿,00:33:22.160,00:33:24.540,"-Madam, are you going out?
-Mm"
00:33:26.040,00:33:29.590,姐姐可以获宠为娘家带来荣耀,,,
00:33:31.360,00:33:32.910,而我却不能呢,00:33:37.320,00:33:38.980,"My Lady, please go inside and get changed."
,,,00:33:39.100,00:33:41.000,Xiao-Yunzi has been waiting for you.
00:33:41.560,00:33:43.670,齐妃娘娘万福金安,00:33:42.000,00:33:44.360,I hope I'm wrong about this.
00:33:47.440,00:33:49.590,莞贵人真是费心了,00:33:46.400,00:33:48.340,"You can go now.
Be vigilant."
00:33:50.960,00:33:52.390,依姐姐看呀,00:33:48.780,00:33:49.660,Yes.
,,,00:34:06.460,00:34:07.580,My Lady.
00:33:52.640,00:33:55.590,你还是不要烦劳去上这一趟了,,,
00:33:56.240,00:33:58.990,皇上有事不见人,,,
00:34:00.720,00:34:02.470,皇上最近忙于西北战事,00:34:07.840,00:34:09.600,"-Is Her Highness here?
-Yes."
,,,00:34:10.080,00:34:11.660,"Xiao-Yunzi, you will wait here."
00:34:03.120,00:34:06.110,的确不愿见人 多谢齐妃告知,,,
00:34:11.120,00:34:11.910,苏公公,00:34:11.840,00:34:12.720,Yes.
00:34:12.840,00:34:15.470,小主来了 皇上正等着您呢,,,
00:34:15.920,00:34:16.590,多谢,,,
00:34:18.960,00:34:21.630,小主 齐妃的脸色可真难看,00:34:20.260,00:34:22.260,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:34:22.880,00:34:24.030,人情世故的事,00:34:22.300,00:34:25.160,"Aiya, you came without a sound.
That surprised me."
00:34:24.280,00:34:25.630,既然无法周全所有人,,,
00:34:26.040,00:34:27.070,就只能周全自己了,00:34:25.680,00:34:27.120,Your Highness seems to be in a good mood.
,,,00:34:27.240,00:34:30.480,"I was just bored, so I was making this bodice."
,,,00:34:30.600,00:34:32.120,Come here.
,,,00:34:32.720,00:34:34.720,Have a look at my bodice.
00:34:37.040,00:34:38.390,皇上万福金安,00:34:36.320,00:34:37.700,"Ruyi, bring some tea."
,,,00:34:37.740,00:34:38.380,Yes.
,,,00:34:38.660,00:34:39.720,It's okay.
,,,00:34:39.800,00:34:41.100,I'd just like to talk with Your Highness.
,,,00:34:41.260,00:34:44.120,They will interrupt our conversation.
,,,00:34:44.940,00:34:46.420,That's right.
,,,00:34:46.700,00:34:49.280,I also find their presence inhibiting sometimes.
,,,00:34:50.040,00:34:54.380,"It's not like they are under my control,
but quite the other way around."
,,,00:34:55.580,00:34:57.300,Your Highness finds peace in solitude.
,,,00:34:57.460,00:34:59.200,It is never peaceful enough in the palace.
,,,00:34:59.360,00:35:03.780,How can we live our lives if we can't find peace in ourselves?
,,,00:35:04.600,00:35:06.380,I appreciate Your Highness's advice.
,,,00:35:07.300,00:35:10.180,Her Highness Consort Fleur.
,,,00:35:11.960,00:35:13.260,Consort Fleur?
00:35:16.040,00:35:17.470,红袖添香在侧,00:35:13.840,00:35:15.900,What brings her here?
00:35:18.360,00:35:21.790,再难的国事也不会觉得烦琐,00:35:16.740,00:35:20.260,She must have her reasons to be here.
00:35:22.520,00:35:25.030,皇上许臣妾可以出入书房请安,00:35:22.420,00:35:25.260,"Your Highness, Consort Fleur
went to the Leisured Moon Chamber."
00:35:25.800,00:35:27.590,臣妾自然不能让皇上讨厌,00:35:25.580,00:35:30.680,"She said that Madam Cui passed some packages
into the chamber for Shen."
,,,00:35:31.620,00:35:33.180,I see.
,,,00:35:35.180,00:35:37.100,Let's wait and see.
00:35:38.560,00:35:39.230,浣碧,00:35:37.160,00:35:39.000,Good.
00:35:40.120,00:35:42.230,我要去闲月阁去见眉姐姐,00:35:39.360,00:35:45.120,"Jinxi only brought some daily necessities and food
and asked me to give them to Companion Shen."
00:35:43.240,00:35:44.750,小主怎么突然要去呀,,,
00:35:45.360,00:35:47.190,皇上不是说无诏,,,
00:35:47.440,00:35:49.470,任何人都不能去见眉庄小主的吗,00:35:45.780,00:35:50.260,She came with two other maids to help her carry the packages.
00:35:49.880,00:35:51.110,我一直惦记着眉姐姐,,,
00:35:51.640,00:35:53.550,有些话必须要当面问她,00:35:50.800,00:35:53.320,But I did not see Lady Sourire.
00:35:54.960,00:35:57.390,浣碧 你是我的陪嫁丫鬟,00:35:53.660,00:35:59.400,"Like Madam Orchid said, Your Highness, I was simply
delivering the packages at My Lady's request."
00:35:57.720,00:35:59.030,宫里见过你的人不多,,,
00:35:59.680,00:36:00.750,我便自称是你,,,
00:36:01.360,00:36:03.790,由槿汐带着去闲月阁送东西,00:36:00.060,00:36:04.540,"I did not disobey His Majesty's order
which forbids anyone to meet with Shen."
00:36:05.000,00:36:06.310,那边我已经打点好了,00:36:05.240,00:36:06.820,Is that so?
00:36:07.000,00:36:07.830,只等入夜,,,
00:36:08.120,00:36:10.230,看守的侍卫交班时蒙混进去,00:36:07.500,00:36:10.260,She said that you came with two other maids.
00:36:10.640,00:36:11.790,自然是万无一失的,,,
00:36:12.680,00:36:15.070,可是小主这万一被发现,00:36:10.520,00:36:14.120,Why is there only one standing beside you?
00:36:15.400,00:36:16.470,可是欺君的大罪,00:36:14.980,00:36:16.500,Where is the other maid?
00:36:17.480,00:36:18.750,您现在圣眷正隆,00:36:16.780,00:36:18.220,Er...
00:36:19.360,00:36:21.110,实在不必去冒这个险,00:36:18.340,00:36:22.380,"The other maid is Violet.
She also works for the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:36:21.920,00:36:23.550,等下我只消低头走头,,,
00:36:23.840,00:36:24.910,不会叫人发觉的,00:36:23.000,00:36:26.000,I sent her back earlier to do some chores.
00:36:26.000,00:36:27.270,圣眷隆与不隆,,,
00:36:27.600,00:36:28.790,我都是要去一趟的,00:36:26.680,00:36:28.520,Did you?
00:36:29.680,00:36:30.950,今晚皇上独宿,00:36:28.700,00:36:32.200,"In that case, I shall not waste my breath arguing with you."
00:36:31.280,00:36:32.510,是再好不过的机会了,,,
00:36:35.720,00:36:37.070,小主可要三思啊,00:36:32.820,00:36:36.580,"It was reported that someone sneaked into the chamber
without permission to visit a confined concubine."
00:36:38.440,00:36:39.350,我心里有数,00:36:37.140,00:36:39.340,This violates His Majesty's edict.
00:36:40.920,00:36:42.710,浣碧 你在寝殿里待着,00:36:39.580,00:36:41.200,I am here to investigate.
00:36:43.160,00:36:44.350,千万别叫人看见你了,00:36:41.420,00:36:44.500,I am attending to Shen's confinement at His Majesty's  behest.
,,,00:36:44.740,00:36:47.240,How could anyone possibly come to meet My Lady?
00:36:48.480,00:36:49.190,走吧,00:36:47.240,00:36:48.880,You never know.
,,,00:36:48.980,00:36:51.600,Some concubines are conceited over their status.
,,,00:36:51.600,00:36:55.400,They might be as bold as brass.
,,,00:37:07.700,00:37:12.060,"Your Majesty, Concubine Estime's maid Ruyi is here."
00:37:00.720,00:37:01.550,姑姑出去呀,,,
00:37:15.680,00:37:16.990,小主进去换衣服吧,00:37:12.700,00:37:16.900,"She said that Consort Fleur is creating a disturbance
outside the Leisured Moon Chamber."
00:37:17.440,00:37:18.870,小允子在里头候着呢,,,
00:37:20.480,00:37:22.630,但愿今天的事只是我白费心机,00:37:17.060,00:37:22.760,"Consort Fleur suspects that someone has
snuck into the chamber to meet Shen without permission."
00:37:24.920,00:37:26.710,你们快去吧小心行事,00:37:23.440,00:37:25.560,Her Highness is trying to enter the chamber and investigate.
00:37:27.120,00:37:27.830,是,00:37:25.940,00:37:28.460,"Well, we can't go a day without disturbance."
,,,00:37:29.680,00:37:33.560,"It seems that Your Majesty is about to get busy again.
Allow me to take my leave."
,,,00:37:33.860,00:37:37.200,"What an easy life without wives.
I'm so jealous of you."
,,,00:37:37.800,00:37:42.300,"(laughs) Well, I thought you were troubled
by the composition of the game."
00:37:44.880,00:37:45.670,小主来了,00:37:42.620,00:37:45.200,"I'll definitely resolve it tonight.
You must not leave."
00:37:46.120,00:37:46.990,敬嫔娘娘在吗,00:37:45.520,00:37:47.940,I don't know when you will be able to come back.
00:37:47.160,00:37:47.830,在,,,
00:37:48.480,00:37:49.990,小允子你在这里等着,00:37:48.180,00:37:51.300,How about we continue the game tomorrow?
,,,00:37:52.240,00:37:54.620,"If so, you shall not leave the palace tonight."
,,,00:37:55.140,00:37:57.180,I'll play with you after court tomorrow.
00:37:50.320,00:37:50.950,嗻,,,
00:37:58.400,00:37:59.670,娘娘万福金安,00:37:57.620,00:37:59.680,"- Su Peisheng.
- Yes, Your Majesty."
00:38:00.040,00:38:03.510,悄没声就进来了吓我一跳,00:37:59.880,00:38:03.820,"Clean up a room for Noble Prince Guo.
He will stay here tonight."
00:38:04.040,00:38:05.270,娘娘好兴致,00:38:04.340,00:38:05.300,Yes.
00:38:05.600,00:38:08.950,没事做拿料子做件肚兜,00:38:05.580,00:38:08.360,"Will Your Lordship mind staying at
the Penglai Island on the lake?"
00:38:09.120,00:38:09.870,来来来,00:38:08.740,00:38:12.200,"It is a quiet and elegant place
away from the residences of the concubines."
00:38:11.040,00:38:12.910,看看这件肚兜做得怎么样,00:38:12.680,00:38:14.100,Sounds good.
00:38:14.800,00:38:15.910,如意倒茶去,00:38:14.440,00:38:16.780,I will see with my own eyes whether there is an intruder.
00:38:16.120,00:38:16.790,是,,,
00:38:17.000,00:38:19.270,不忙我与娘娘说说话,,,
00:38:19.720,00:38:20.510,旁人一进来,,,
00:38:20.800,00:38:22.390,倒扫了咱们说话的兴致了,00:38:20.220,00:38:22.540,"Your highness, no one else is inside."
00:38:23.560,00:38:24.390,也是啊,00:38:22.700,00:38:24.620,Your Highness need not enter.
00:38:24.920,00:38:26.510,我平日里也嫌她们在旁边,00:38:25.040,00:38:28.200,"According to His Majesty's edict,
I dare not let Your Highness in."
00:38:26.880,00:38:27.710,拘束得很,,,
00:38:28.360,00:38:30.110,倒不像我拘束了她们,00:38:28.520,00:38:29.840,I beg Your Highness's pardon.
00:38:30.320,00:38:32.750,倒像是她们拘束着我似的,00:38:30.080,00:38:32.160,How dare you stand in my way?
,,,00:38:32.580,00:38:34.100,"Your Highness, I dare not."
00:38:33.760,00:38:35.150,娘娘就是这样好静,00:38:34.140,00:38:35.640,Out of my way!
00:38:35.640,00:38:36.790,宫里的烦心事多,00:38:35.740,00:38:37.860,"Your Highness, I cannot let you in."
00:38:37.440,00:38:39.270,要是自己不让自己心静,,,
00:38:40.120,00:38:42.110,这日子该怎么过,00:38:38.580,00:38:41.420,His Majesty the Emperor!

00:39:00.640,00:39:02.830,华妃娘娘到旁边的闲月阁去了,,,
00:39:03.080,00:39:05.590,说是莞贵人身边的槿汐姑姑,,,
00:39:05.880,00:39:07.070,刚才带人传东西进去,,,
00:39:07.400,00:39:08.310,给眉庄小主呢,,,

00:39:29.040,00:39:31.310,却并未见莞贵人前来呀,00:39:20.360,00:39:38.500,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart."
00:39:32.040,00:39:33.550,芳若姑姑说得正是,,,
00:39:34.200,00:39:36.510,奴婢只是奉莞贵人之命,,,
00:39:36.760,00:39:37.950,前来送些东西的,,,
00:39:38.400,00:39:39.990,并未违抗皇上旨意,,,

00:39:43.600,00:39:44.510,是吗,,,
00:39:45.640,00:39:47.990,不是说槿汐你带了两个人过来吗,00:39:38.500,00:39:57.160,"Behind me are the promises and longing.

00:39:48.600,00:39:52.030,怎么眼下只有你和你身边这一个,,,
00:39:53.360,00:39:54.350,那一个呢,,,
00:39:56.680,00:40:00.550,那一位是碎玉轩中的宫女佩儿,,,
00:40:01.240,00:40:02.390,由于宫中有事,,,
00:40:02.920,00:40:04.590,奴婢先让她回去了,,,
00:40:05.000,00:40:06.150,是吗,00:39:57.160,00:40:14.940,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe."
00:40:06.920,00:40:07.990,那本宫大可不必,,,

00:40:25.640,00:40:26.630,那可未必,,,
00:40:27.160,00:40:29.550,这宫里恃宠而骄的人不少,00:40:23.700,00:40:35.420,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.
