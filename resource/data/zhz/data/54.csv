00:02:24.220,00:02:26.880,娘娘皇上从甘露寺回来了,00:02:25.320,00:02:28.160,"Your Majesty, His Majesty is back from the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:02:27.980,00:02:30.260,这个时候回来,00:02:29.080,00:02:31.360,At this hour...
00:02:30.810,00:02:33.140,正好请皇上过来一同用晚膳,00:02:31.910,00:02:34.449,Just in time to invite His Majesty over for dinner.
00:02:33.690,00:02:35.020,可皇上已经传了口谕,,,
00:02:35.400,00:02:36.260,说今日疲乏,00:02:34.790,00:02:36.320,"His Majesty said that he is tired,"
00:02:36.740,00:02:38.100,不需嫔妃前往请安,00:02:36.500,00:02:39.485,and exempted concubines from paying respects today.
00:02:38.740,00:02:40.070,已在养心殿歇息了,,,
00:02:40.860,00:02:42.230,二月二是大日子,00:02:39.840,00:02:41.614,His Majesty is now resting in the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:02:42.570,00:02:43.860,皇上必定留宿景仁宫,00:02:41.960,00:02:46.073,"Longtaitou Festival is an important day.
Surely His Majesty will stay in my palace tonight."
00:02:44.660,00:02:45.870,今日怎么,00:02:46.073,00:02:47.133,How come ...
00:02:46.200,00:02:48.570,你去打听看看今天在甘露寺,,,
00:02:48.960,00:02:50.040,可出了什么岔子,00:02:47.300,00:02:51.120,Go inquire if anything went amiss today at the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:02:50.830,00:02:51.950,奴婢已经打听过了,,,
00:02:52.380,00:02:53.910,可御前的人嘴都紧得很,00:02:51.930,00:02:53.300,"I already have, Your Majesty."
00:02:54.250,00:02:55.040,什么也问不出来,00:02:53.480,00:02:55.360,But His Majesty's direct servants were very tight-lipped.
,,,00:02:55.360,00:02:56.812,I was not able to find out anything.
00:02:57.260,00:03:00.960,越问不出东西就越是有古怪,00:02:58.360,00:03:02.060,If they acted that way something must be very odd.
00:03:07.470,00:03:09.720,皇上可惦记着莞嫔娘娘呢,00:03:08.570,00:03:11.070,His Majesty has been thinking of Your Highness a lot.
00:03:10.140,00:03:10.760,一回宫,,,
00:03:11.190,00:03:14.180,就打发奴才拣好东西来奉与娘娘,00:03:11.240,00:03:15.280,"He sent me to deliver these to Your Highness
as soon as we returned to the palace."
00:03:15.650,00:03:16.510,有劳公公了,,,
00:03:17.730,00:03:19.220,如何帮皇上瞒住宫里,00:03:16.750,00:03:18.069,"Thank you, Mr. Su."
00:03:19.900,00:03:21.270,那就得看公公的本事了,00:03:18.830,00:03:22.537,I believe that you are capable of helping His Majesty conceal this from the harem.
00:03:21.700,00:03:24.190,是这个奴才一定会尽力的,00:03:22.800,00:03:25.373,"Yes, I will do my best, Your Highness."
00:03:24.660,00:03:25.860,那我父亲的事,,,
00:03:26.160,00:03:27.070,这个奴才知道,00:03:25.760,00:03:27.043,As for my father...
,,,00:03:27.260,00:03:28.546,"I understand, Your Highness."
00:03:28.910,00:03:31.950,这件事若是由娘娘亲自开口,00:03:30.010,00:03:33.320,"If Your Highness mentions this to His Majesty directly,"
00:03:32.290,00:03:34.750,就会让皇上觉得上回相会之事,,,
00:03:35.090,00:03:36.540,是娘娘有所图谋的,00:03:33.440,00:03:37.840,"he might suspect that you had
ulterior motives for your meeting the other day."
00:03:37.170,00:03:39.410,所以奴才已经寻了个机会提起来,00:03:38.270,00:03:40.719,So I have taken an opportunity to bring this up.
00:03:40.220,00:03:41.460,皇上爱屋及乌,,,
00:03:41.840,00:03:43.420,自然关怀娘娘的父亲,00:03:41.320,00:03:45.092,His Majesty cares about Mr. Zhen because he knows you care about your father.
00:03:44.260,00:03:46.750,虽然老大人还是戴罪之身吧,00:03:45.360,00:03:47.975,"Even though Mr. Zhen has not been exonerated,"
00:03:47.260,00:03:49.680,皇上却已派了人从甯古塔,,,
00:03:50.180,00:03:52.270,送老大人回京医治了,00:03:48.360,00:03:53.440,"His Majesty sent an escort to Ningguta to
bring him back to the capital for medical treatment."
00:03:52.980,00:03:55.140,想来不日后就能顺利抵京了,00:03:54.080,00:03:56.783,"If all goes as planned, Mr. Zhen will arrive in Beijing soon."
00:03:56.940,00:03:59.150,那我该如何感谢公公的盛情呢,00:03:58.040,00:04:00.333,"How should I repay your kindness, Mr. Su?"
00:04:00.360,00:04:01.600,娘娘您是贵人,,,
00:04:02.280,00:04:04.400,奴才怎敢向娘娘讨赏呢,00:04:01.460,00:04:05.480,"How could I ask for a reward
for serving Your Highness?"
00:04:05.780,00:04:07.240,以我今时今日的地位,,,
00:04:07.830,00:04:09.280,即便你开口向我要什么,00:04:06.880,00:04:08.632,"In my current position,"
00:04:09.620,00:04:10.530,我也未必给得起,00:04:08.930,00:04:11.808,I might not be able to offer what you request.
00:04:11.080,00:04:12.440,你又何必急着推托呢,,,
00:04:13.170,00:04:14.150,娘娘言重了,00:04:12.180,00:04:14.080,"But, please don't feel obliged to decline me."
,,,00:04:14.270,00:04:15.980,Your Highness flatters me too greatly.
00:04:14.880,00:04:17.290,奴才只是略尽绵力罢了,00:04:15.980,00:04:18.390,I just did what little I'm capable of.
00:04:20.130,00:04:21.210,娘娘可听说,00:04:21.151,00:04:22.318,"Your Majesty,"
00:04:21.840,00:04:23.630,皇上最近常往甘露寺去,00:04:22.901,00:04:24.847,have you heard that recently His Majesty has been
00:04:24.380,00:04:25.500,说是去烧香,00:04:25.475,00:04:27.326,offering incense at the Temple of Pure Dew more frequently?
00:04:27.430,00:04:30.140,甘露寺那儿有个谁你不清楚吗,00:04:28.530,00:04:31.240,The Temple of Pure Dew? Don't you know who lives there?
00:04:31.350,00:04:32.590,剪秋不是说,,,
00:04:33.020,00:04:34.760,甄环已经不在甘露寺了吗,00:04:32.450,00:04:35.847,Didn't Autumn say that Zhen Huan no longer lives there?
00:04:35.520,00:04:38.060,听说皇上每回去甘露寺祈福,,,
00:04:38.440,00:04:40.810,都要去甄嬛如今所住的凌云峰,00:04:36.620,00:04:41.880,"I've heard that every time His Majesty goes,
he also visits Peak Lingyun, where Zhen Huan now resides."
00:04:42.280,00:04:46.020,到底是咱们失于防范了,00:04:43.380,00:04:47.120,It would seem that we have let our guard down after all.
00:04:47.530,00:04:49.940,皇上这样与一位废妃来往过密,,,
00:04:50.540,00:04:51.650,恐怕有损圣誉,00:04:48.630,00:04:53.083,Having close contacts with a banished concubine might damage His Majesty's prestige.
00:04:52.540,00:04:53.990,不知娘娘有何打算,,,
00:04:54.410,00:04:55.400,打算,00:04:53.640,00:04:55.510,I wonder if Your Majesty has a plan?
,,,00:04:55.510,00:04:56.667,A plan?
00:04:57.000,00:05:00.240,到底只是些捕风捉影的闲言碎语,00:04:58.100,00:05:01.340,Such gossip is just baseless hearsay.
00:05:00.750,00:05:01.830,且看看再说吧,00:05:01.527,00:05:03.310,We'll watch how things unfold first.
00:05:02.210,00:05:05.130,那皇上若再去甘露寺祈福,,,
00:05:05.510,00:05:07.470,娘娘可否请求同行,00:05:03.310,00:05:08.560,"What if Your Majesty requests to accompany
His Majesty when he visits the temple next time?"
00:05:08.140,00:05:09.670,这样也好安心,00:05:09.240,00:05:10.910,That might put Your Majesty's worries to rest.
00:05:10.060,00:05:12.760,皇上意欲独行 本宫也无可奈何,00:05:11.160,00:05:14.027,"If His Majesty insists on going there alone,
then there's nothing I can do about it."
00:05:13.980,00:05:16.810,只能先看着情势再想办法,00:05:14.717,00:05:18.240,We'll have to monitor the situation and develop a plan.
00:05:20.900,00:05:22.390,娘子苏公公来了,00:05:22.000,00:05:23.740,"My Lady, Mr. Su is here."
00:05:25.360,00:05:26.980,奴才给娘娘请安,,,
00:05:27.240,00:05:28.820,公公免礼快坐,00:05:26.460,00:05:28.080,Peace to Your Highness.
00:05:29.450,00:05:30.030,多谢娘娘,00:05:28.340,00:05:29.920,Please rise and have a seat.
00:05:30.280,00:05:31.020,浣碧上茶,00:05:30.550,00:05:31.380,"- I thank Your Highness.
- Serve the tea, Jade"
00:05:34.500,00:05:36.240,这茶虽不是什么名茶,,,
00:05:36.580,00:05:37.740,确也清香扑鼻,00:05:35.600,00:05:37.423,"This is not a famous tea,"
00:05:38.120,00:05:38.910,多谢娘娘,00:05:37.680,00:05:38.965,but it smells fresh.
00:05:39.790,00:05:40.410,娘娘小姐,00:05:39.220,00:05:40.344,I profusely thank Your Highness.
00:05:41.290,00:05:42.080,您怎么了,00:05:40.890,00:05:42.052,"- Your Highness!
- My Lady."
00:05:42.380,00:05:44.540,我们娘子这几日一直作呕不止,00:05:42.390,00:05:43.480,What's wrong?
,,,00:05:43.480,00:05:46.040,Mistress has been vomiting frequently these days.
00:05:51.430,00:05:54.010,恭喜娘娘恭喜娘娘啊,00:05:52.530,00:05:55.110,"Congratulations, Your Highness."
00:05:54.810,00:05:56.010,这除了槿汐和浣碧,,,
00:05:56.430,00:05:57.970,公公是头一个知道的,00:05:55.910,00:05:59.080,"You are the first person to know, besides Jinxi and Jade."
00:05:58.560,00:05:59.180,是吗,00:05:59.660,00:06:00.530,Really?
00:06:00.940,00:06:02.270,恕奴才多嘴一问,,,
00:06:03.320,00:06:05.730,娘娘这身孕可有多久了,00:06:02.040,00:06:06.800,May I ask how long Your Highness has been pregnant?
00:06:07.240,00:06:10.320,不前不后刚刚一个月多上一点,00:06:08.340,00:06:11.420,Just a little over a month.
00:06:12.370,00:06:14.030,那可不正是,,,
00:06:14.330,00:06:16.410,皇上头一次来凌云峰的时候吗,00:06:14.502,00:06:17.520,Then it was the first time His Majesty came to Peak Lingyun.
00:06:17.080,00:06:17.610,是,,,
00:06:17.960,00:06:19.950,奴才可要好好地贺喜娘娘了,00:06:18.000,00:06:18.835,Yes.
00:06:20.420,00:06:22.950,娘娘您这个身孕有的正是时候,00:06:19.060,00:06:24.040,I would like to congratulate Your Highness on your timely conception.
00:06:23.380,00:06:25.160,正好借这个由头回宫去,,,
00:06:25.510,00:06:26.870,一切就顺理成章了,00:06:24.480,00:06:27.960,This is surely a reason for Your Highness to return to the palace.
00:06:28.430,00:06:29.840,皇上知道我有了身孕,,,
00:06:30.140,00:06:31.170,难免会欢喜过头,00:06:29.530,00:06:31.031,"When His Majesty hears that I am with child,"
,,,00:06:31.031,00:06:32.604,he is likely to be overcome with excitement.
00:06:31.970,00:06:34.840,还得请公公在皇上身边提点着,00:06:33.070,00:06:35.940,Please advise him to practice restraint.
00:06:35.140,00:06:36.000,是是是,00:06:36.240,00:06:37.410,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:06:36.310,00:06:39.100,皇后身子欠佳 宫中诸事烦扰,00:06:37.410,00:06:40.200,"The Empress is in ill health
and troubled with matters in the palace."
00:06:39.810,00:06:42.890,我的身孕实在不必惊动他人,00:06:40.910,00:06:43.990,You needn't bother others with the news of my pregnancy.
00:06:43.230,00:06:44.970,是这个奴才明白,00:06:44.330,00:06:46.070,"Yes, I understand."
00:06:45.530,00:06:46.890,只皇上知道就行了,00:06:46.630,00:06:48.157,I'll let only His Majesty know.
00:06:48.110,00:06:49.690,可是娘娘有着身孕,00:06:49.210,00:06:50.915,Your Highness is now pregnant.
00:06:50.110,00:06:52.900,总得请太医来为娘娘安胎请脉呀,00:06:51.210,00:06:54.000,We have to send a doctor to provide prenatal care.
00:06:55.290,00:06:57.200,我们娘娘现在身份未明,00:06:56.390,00:06:58.592,Her Highness's status is still unclear.
00:06:57.700,00:06:59.620,许多事情上都未免尴尬,00:06:58.800,00:07:00.720,So this could be awkward in a number of respects.
00:07:00.210,00:07:01.700,此事就更怕张扬了,00:07:01.310,00:07:03.259,All the more reason the news should not be spread.
00:07:02.830,00:07:06.200,倒是太医院的温实初温大人,00:07:03.930,00:07:07.300,"Dr. Wen Shichu from the Imperial Infirmary, however,"
00:07:06.590,00:07:08.370,与我们娘娘曾有几分交情,00:07:07.690,00:07:09.637,is on good terms with Her Highness.
00:07:08.720,00:07:10.920,不如请他来为娘娘安胎请脉,00:07:09.820,00:07:12.020,Sending him to look after Her Highness
00:07:11.300,00:07:12.260,怕是妥帖些,00:07:12.233,00:07:13.569,would be quite appropriate.
00:07:14.640,00:07:17.760,还是槿汐考虑周全哪如此甚好,00:07:15.740,00:07:18.860,"Jinxi, you've thought of everything! That's perfect."
00:07:18.270,00:07:21.350,皇上一向称赞温大人妙手仁心,00:07:19.370,00:07:22.450,His Majesty has always praised Dr. Wen's skills and kindliness.
00:07:21.730,00:07:22.640,必定会应允的,,,
00:07:23.690,00:07:25.140,公公在皇上身边久矣,00:07:22.830,00:07:24.074,I'm sure he will allow it.
00:07:25.770,00:07:27.060,自然知道该如何说,00:07:24.790,00:07:26.574,"Mr. Su, you have served His Majesty for a long time."
00:07:27.400,00:07:27.980,是,00:07:26.870,00:07:28.500,I trust you to know how to word it.
00:07:28.490,00:07:30.230,我只要在这荒山野岭当中,00:07:28.500,00:07:29.372,Yes.
00:07:30.990,00:07:32.690,能够安安静静待产就好,00:07:29.590,00:07:32.279,I will be glad so long as I can deliver my child in peace
,,,00:07:32.279,00:07:34.560,even if these mountains are remote and barren.
00:07:33.700,00:07:35.360,娘娘您这是说笑话了,00:07:34.800,00:07:36.460,Your Highness must be joking.
00:07:35.780,00:07:37.990,皇上怎能让娘娘在这儿待产呢,00:07:36.880,00:07:39.257,How could His Majesty leave Your Highness here?
00:07:38.330,00:07:40.660,必定是要接回宫里去好好养着的,00:07:39.430,00:07:41.760,His Majesty will most certainly bring Your Highness back to the palace.
00:07:41.330,00:07:42.490,我既是废妃出宫,,,
00:07:43.040,00:07:44.370,哪里有再回宫的道理,00:07:42.430,00:07:43.965,I left the palace as a banished concubine.
,,,00:07:44.140,00:07:45.760,How could I be allowed to go back?
00:07:45.750,00:07:49.120,我只盼这孩子能够平安长大,00:07:46.850,00:07:50.220,My only wish is that this child can grow up safely.
00:07:49.880,00:07:50.670,就好了,00:07:50.980,00:07:52.145,That would be enough.
00:07:53.800,00:07:55.590,娘娘您这话是从何说起呢,00:07:54.900,00:07:56.982,What makes Your Highness say that?
00:07:56.720,00:07:58.510,您怀的是皇室血脉,00:07:57.820,00:07:59.735,You are carrying the imperial bloodline.
00:07:59.020,00:08:00.930,怎能不归入宗室玉牒呢,00:08:00.120,00:08:02.364,How could your child not be included in the imperial family?
00:08:01.560,00:08:03.350,皇上又一向重视皇嗣,00:08:02.660,00:08:04.784,His Majesty has always placed great importance on the imperial heirs.
00:08:03.980,00:08:06.190,必定是珍而重之啊,00:08:05.080,00:08:07.360,He will deeply treasure your child.
00:08:07.360,00:08:08.940,皇上如今能这般待我,00:08:08.460,00:08:10.290,It is my greatest fortune
00:08:09.360,00:08:10.720,已是我最大的福分了,00:08:10.460,00:08:12.029,that His Majesty treats me this way.
00:08:11.530,00:08:13.020,我哪里还敢再奢求什么,00:08:12.630,00:08:14.412,How dare I have desires beyond that?
00:08:15.120,00:08:16.070,若是皇上,00:08:16.220,00:08:17.545,But if His Majesty
00:08:17.410,00:08:19.400,能给我腹中的孩子有个名分,00:08:18.510,00:08:20.500,"granted my unborn child a title,"
00:08:20.790,00:08:22.570,即便是以答应身份回宫,00:08:21.890,00:08:23.920,"then even if I returned to the palace as a Companion,"
00:08:23.290,00:08:24.450,我也感激涕零了,00:08:24.390,00:08:26.009,I would shed tears of gratitude.
00:08:26.130,00:08:27.370,娘娘您有着身孕,,,
00:08:27.710,00:08:28.920,可千万伤心不得,00:08:27.230,00:08:30.000,Your Highness must harm your health with sadness.
00:08:30.590,00:08:32.250,娘娘和皇嗣要紧,00:08:31.690,00:08:33.809,Please take care of yourself and the imperial heir.
00:08:33.010,00:08:34.870,奴才会想法子和皇上说的,00:08:34.110,00:08:36.137,I'll find a way to raise it with His Majesty.
00:08:35.890,00:08:37.590,那这事可是要抓紧办呢,,,
00:08:37.930,00:08:39.140,万万不能走漏了风声,00:08:36.990,00:08:38.773,"It is urgent, but a very sensitive matter"
00:08:39.970,00:08:41.550,我们娘子现在只身在外,00:08:39.030,00:08:40.657,and must not leak to anyone else.
00:08:42.180,00:08:43.670,万一让人知道有了身孕,00:08:41.070,00:08:42.942,Mistress is now alone outside the palace.
00:08:44.230,00:08:46.140,那又不知道要闹出什么乱子来呢,00:08:43.280,00:08:45.146,"If anyone finds out that she's pregnant,"
,,,00:08:45.330,00:08:47.532,I can't imagine what trouble that might bring.
00:08:46.980,00:08:49.720,奴才知道轻重你好好伺候娘娘,00:08:48.080,00:08:50.820,"I understand the stakes. Jinxi, take good care of Her Highness."
00:08:50.820,00:08:52.810,奴才回头就回禀皇上,00:08:51.920,00:08:53.993,I will report this to His Majesty
00:08:53.530,00:08:55.520,指温太医来为娘娘安胎,00:08:54.630,00:08:56.800,and send Dr. Wen for Your Highness's prenatal care.
00:08:56.200,00:08:56.980,多谢公公,,,
00:08:57.620,00:08:58.400,奴才告辞,00:08:57.300,00:08:58.497,"Thank you, Mr. Su."
,,,00:08:58.720,00:08:59.792,Allow me to take my leave.
00:09:06.460,00:09:07.200,温大人,00:09:07.560,00:09:08.592,Dr. Wen.
00:09:08.380,00:09:10.740,苏公公驾临不知有何贵干,00:09:09.480,00:09:12.007,"Mr. Su, what noble task has brought you here?"
00:09:11.420,00:09:13.500,温大人咱们也甭客气了,00:09:12.520,00:09:14.850,"Let's not stand on ceremony, Dr. Wen."
00:09:14.090,00:09:16.830,今儿个呢 我是奉了皇上的口谕,00:09:15.190,00:09:18.139,"I'm here today on His Majesty's orders,"
00:09:17.550,00:09:19.460,给温大人带个差事来的,00:09:18.650,00:09:20.727,with an assignment for you.
00:09:20.060,00:09:22.050,皇上钦点了大人,00:09:21.160,00:09:23.150,His Majesty has appointed you
00:09:22.350,00:09:24.460,为一位小主请脉安胎呀,00:09:23.408,00:09:25.851,to take care of a pregnant concubine.
00:09:25.310,00:09:26.300,多谢公公提点,00:09:26.410,00:09:27.740,"Thank you for informing me, sir."
00:09:26.640,00:09:28.680,可不知是哪一宫的小主呢,00:09:27.740,00:09:30.000,Which palace shall I attend to?
00:09:29.020,00:09:31.980,说来这位温大人你也是认得的,00:09:30.120,00:09:33.080,"This concubine ... You are well acquainted already, Dr. Wen."
00:09:32.780,00:09:33.480,我也认得,,,
00:09:33.820,00:09:34.900,如今这位小主,00:09:33.880,00:09:34.920,I am?
00:09:35.240,00:09:36.650,正在凌云峰小住着呢,00:09:34.920,00:09:36.167,This concubine
00:09:37.820,00:09:38.480,难道是,00:09:36.340,00:09:38.168,currently resides at Peak Lingyun.
00:09:38.660,00:09:40.820,这件事可是皇上特谕交代的,00:09:38.920,00:09:39.760,Is it ...?
00:09:41.700,00:09:43.320,容不得第三人知晓,00:09:39.760,00:09:42.087,This is a special assignment from His Majesty.
00:09:43.910,00:09:45.120,能明白我的意思吗,00:09:42.800,00:09:44.712,No one else can know about it.
00:09:45.960,00:09:47.450,下官明白了,00:09:45.010,00:09:46.429,Do you understand what I mean by this?
,,,00:09:47.060,00:09:48.800,"I understand, sir."
00:09:50.960,00:09:51.620,温大人,00:09:52.060,00:09:53.220,Dr. Wen.
00:09:55.090,00:09:56.460,瞧你跑得满头大汗的,00:09:56.190,00:09:57.769,Look at you sweating all over.
00:09:57.470,00:09:59.960,先坐下来喝口茶润润吧,00:09:58.570,00:10:01.060,Sit down and drink some tea.
00:10:03.600,00:10:04.590,我没心思喝茶,,,
00:10:06.560,00:10:08.050,你父亲已经回京医治了,00:10:04.700,00:10:06.190,I don't feel like having tea.
00:10:09.020,00:10:10.260,是苏培盛让小厦子,00:10:07.660,00:10:09.732,Your father has returned to Beijing to receive medical treatment.
00:10:10.650,00:10:11.640,到太医院请的太医,00:10:10.120,00:10:13.487,"Su Peisheng sent Xiao-Xiazi
to bring a doctor from the Imperial Infirmary."
00:10:12.690,00:10:14.270,苏培盛是御前的人,00:10:13.790,00:10:15.703,Su Peisheng is His Majesty's direct servant.
00:10:14.820,00:10:16.680,他怎么会突然接你父亲回京呢,00:10:15.920,00:10:18.155,Why would he suddenly bring your father back to Beijing?
00:10:17.530,00:10:18.740,你既然已经知道了,00:10:18.672,00:10:20.341,"Since you already know,"
00:10:20.370,00:10:22.280,又何必要费口舌来问我这些呢,00:10:21.470,00:10:23.380,why bother asking me?
00:10:27.120,00:10:28.530,苏培盛有没有告诉你,00:10:28.220,00:10:30.000,Did Su Peisheng tell you ...
00:10:30.920,00:10:31.830,我有了身孕,,,
00:10:33.250,00:10:34.790,要你来看顾我 为我安胎,00:10:31.957,00:10:33.665,that I am with child?
00:10:36.260,00:10:37.170,且我的身孕,00:10:34.321,00:10:36.829,"Did he ask you to take care of me, and the child?"
00:10:37.470,00:10:38.670,不是你所知道的两个多月,00:10:37.158,00:10:40.000,"Did he say that I've been pregnant for only a month,"
00:10:40.140,00:10:41.220,而只有一个多月,00:10:41.073,00:10:43.529,rather than the two months you know it to be?
00:10:42.890,00:10:46.850,嬛儿为什么为什么会这样,00:10:43.990,00:10:45.281,Huan'er...
,,,00:10:45.490,00:10:48.159,Why? What happened?
00:10:47.310,00:10:48.590,因为我遇见了皇上,00:10:48.410,00:10:50.000,Because I met with His Majesty.
00:10:50.440,00:10:53.270,我这个孩子是皇上的,00:10:51.540,00:10:53.018,My child...
,,,00:10:53.352,00:10:54.704,belongs to His Majesty.
00:10:55.070,00:10:58.400,所以苏培盛会让你来为我安胎,00:10:56.170,00:10:59.583,That's why Su Peisheng sent you to tend to my prenatal care.
00:10:59.400,00:11:00.560,可这孩子明明是,,,
00:11:00.860,00:11:01.940,是谁的都不要紧,00:11:00.500,00:11:01.960,But this child clearly belongs to -
00:11:03.200,00:11:04.190,要紧的是皇上认定,00:11:01.960,00:11:04.041,It doesn't matter who this child belongs to.
00:11:04.580,00:11:05.530,这个孩子是他的,00:11:04.300,00:11:06.896,What matters is that His Majesty thinks this is his child
00:11:06.330,00:11:07.320,认定了我腹中的孩子,,,
00:11:07.620,00:11:08.360,只有一个多月,00:11:07.430,00:11:09.640,and that I have only been pregnant for just over a month.
00:11:08.540,00:11:09.200,你疯了,00:11:09.640,00:11:10.967,Are you insane?
00:11:10.210,00:11:13.320,这这可是欺君之罪啊这万一,00:11:11.310,00:11:14.420,It's a crime to deceive His Majesty! What if...
00:11:13.670,00:11:16.210,没有万一若是有万一,00:11:14.770,00:11:16.643,"There's no ""what if""."
00:11:16.920,00:11:18.380,那这个万一就是你不肯帮我,00:11:16.643,00:11:18.020,"The only ""what if"""
00:11:19.220,00:11:20.000,你去告诉皇上,00:11:18.020,00:11:20.000,is what if you refuse to help me.
00:11:20.840,00:11:22.210,我已经有两个多月的身孕,00:11:20.320,00:11:21.726,Go tell His Majesty
00:11:22.640,00:11:23.370,根本不是他的,00:11:21.940,00:11:23.740,"that I've been pregnant for over two months,"
,,,00:11:23.740,00:11:25.095,and that the child is not his!
00:11:27.600,00:11:29.010,你明明知道我不会,00:11:28.700,00:11:30.110,You know I wouldn't!
00:11:30.440,00:11:32.430,嬛儿我已经跟你说过,00:11:31.540,00:11:33.530,"Huan'er, I've told you before,"
00:11:33.230,00:11:34.560,你若是生下这个孩子,00:11:34.330,00:11:35.952,"if you give birth to this child,"
00:11:35.020,00:11:37.230,我会照顾你们母子一生一世,00:11:36.120,00:11:38.622,I will take care of you both for the rest of my life.
00:11:38.150,00:11:39.520,你大可以放心呢你,00:11:39.250,00:11:40.995,What do you have to worry about?
00:11:41.320,00:11:43.310,你能照顾我和孩子一生一世,00:11:42.420,00:11:45.119,You might be able to take care of me and my child.
00:11:45.580,00:11:47.160,可是你能帮我把我病重的父亲,,,
00:11:47.540,00:11:49.490,从甯古塔接回来好好医治吗,00:11:46.680,00:11:50.894,"But could you have brought my father back for
 treatment when he fell gravely ill in Ningguta?"
00:11:52.830,00:11:54.040,你能保全我的家人,,,
00:11:54.420,00:11:55.410,不再为人所害吗,00:11:53.930,00:11:56.800,Could you protect my whole family from any future harm?
00:11:59.260,00:12:01.000,你能帮我查明允礼的死因,00:12:00.360,00:12:02.475,Could you help me to investigate
00:12:01.630,00:12:02.460,为他报仇吗,00:12:02.730,00:12:04.185,and avenge Yunli's death?
00:12:04.090,00:12:06.460,说来说去终究是我无能,00:12:05.190,00:12:07.935,"I am not capable of any of those things, after all."
00:12:07.560,00:12:08.590,我不能帮你,00:12:08.660,00:12:10.209,I would not be able to help you.
00:12:10.270,00:12:11.510,不是你不能帮我,00:12:11.370,00:12:13.169,It is not your incapability.
00:12:13.350,00:12:14.890,而是我命途多舛,00:12:14.450,00:12:16.317,It is my ill fate.
00:12:17.320,00:12:18.980,我好不容易离开了紫禁城,00:12:18.420,00:12:20.622,I finally escaped from the Forbidden City.
00:12:20.320,00:12:22.060,可是现在还是不得不回去,00:12:21.420,00:12:23.452,But now I still have to go back.
00:12:24.860,00:12:28.070,因为这天下是皇上的,00:12:25.960,00:12:29.420,Because all under Heaven belongs to His Majesty.
00:12:29.540,00:12:31.320,没有人能帮得了我那么多,00:12:30.473,00:12:32.712,No one else can help me as much as he can.
00:12:34.580,00:12:35.790,如果有别的办法,00:12:35.680,00:12:37.224,I wouldn't choose this
00:12:37.290,00:12:38.660,我也未必肯走这一步,00:12:38.390,00:12:40.167,if there were another way.
00:12:43.420,00:12:44.710,如今你肯帮我就帮,00:12:44.520,00:12:46.060,"Help me if you want to,"
00:12:45.890,00:12:48.090,不能帮我我也不会勉强你,00:12:46.990,00:12:49.440,but I won't force you to.
00:12:50.010,00:12:51.930,我和这孩子的路本来就难走,00:12:50.787,00:12:54.047,The path ahead is already difficult for me and my child.
00:12:53.270,00:12:54.380,可即便再难走,00:12:54.047,00:12:56.173,"But however difficult it is,"
00:12:56.060,00:12:57.640,一步一步就算要死,00:12:56.958,00:12:59.533,"even if every step forward will lead to my death,"
00:12:58.980,00:12:59.940,我都要保全他,00:12:59.717,00:13:01.613,I will protect my child.
00:13:01.070,00:13:04.360,可是我如果这么保着你走下去,00:13:02.170,00:13:05.460,"But, even if I help you,"
00:13:05.360,00:13:07.450,只能保着你回宫踏上旧路,00:13:05.774,00:13:09.493,"I can only help you back to the old path,
the same old life in the palace."
00:13:08.620,00:13:11.480,嬛儿那条路太苦了,00:13:09.720,00:13:12.580,"Huan'er, that path will be so difficult."
00:13:13.200,00:13:14.790,我在宫外无依无靠,00:13:13.977,00:13:16.374,I have no one to rely on outside the palace.
00:13:16.370,00:13:18.080,不过是坐以待毙罢了,00:13:17.470,00:13:19.430,I can only sit here and await death.
00:13:20.590,00:13:22.920,宫里的日子哪怕是斗得无穷无尽,00:13:21.448,00:13:24.746,"Even if I have endless struggles in the palace,"
00:13:24.800,00:13:25.790,总比在这里,,,
00:13:26.510,00:13:28.250,斗也不斗就被人害死的好,00:13:25.900,00:13:29.612,"it's better than being murdered
here without even putting up a fight."
00:13:30.850,00:13:35.890,实初哥哥有些事你不愿意去做,00:13:31.950,00:13:33.376,"Shichu,"
,,,00:13:35.420,00:13:37.926,there are some things that you don't want to do.
00:13:37.270,00:13:38.430,我也未必愿意,00:13:37.926,00:13:39.840,I don't want to either.
00:13:40.940,00:13:42.150,只是事到临头,00:13:42.040,00:13:43.876,"But when things come to a head,"
00:13:43.940,00:13:45.400,我并不是一个洒脱的人,00:13:45.040,00:13:46.500,I am not free from cares.
00:13:46.700,00:13:47.860,可以任性来去,00:13:47.598,00:13:49.656,I'm not free to go where I desire.
00:13:52.200,00:13:53.320,早知道有今天,,,
00:13:55.200,00:13:56.540,我情愿你永远也不知道,00:13:53.300,00:13:55.071,"If I had known it would come to this,"
00:13:56.910,00:13:57.740,果郡王的死讯,00:13:56.300,00:13:59.385,"I'd rather you never knew
about Noble Prince Guo's death."
00:14:02.300,00:14:04.660,罢了嬛儿,00:14:03.400,00:14:05.760,"All right then, Huan'er."
00:14:06.130,00:14:08.040,这世上我拿你最没办法,00:14:07.230,00:14:09.265,"In this world, you're the only one I can't refuse."
00:14:09.800,00:14:13.010,除了帮你除了听你的,00:14:10.900,00:14:14.110,There's nothing I can do to help you
00:14:13.890,00:14:15.760,我也没有其他帮助你的法子,00:14:14.990,00:14:17.280,but listen to you and aid in your plan.
00:14:17.440,00:14:18.890,你既然要保全别人,00:14:18.540,00:14:20.324,"Since you wish to protect others,"
00:14:20.020,00:14:21.850,我便拼命保全你就是,00:14:21.120,00:14:23.284,I will protect you with all my might.
00:14:33.660,00:14:34.900,微臣叩见皇上,00:14:34.760,00:14:36.927,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:14:36.660,00:14:40.530,温太医情况如何,00:14:37.760,00:14:39.351,"Dr. Wen,"
,,,00:14:40.435,00:14:42.201,how is her condition?
00:14:41.330,00:14:44.870,回皇上莞嫔娘娘有喜已有一月,00:14:42.430,00:14:46.239,"Your Majesty, Concubine Sourire is already one month pregnant."
00:14:45.800,00:14:46.380,只是,,,
00:14:47.260,00:14:48.040,只是什么,00:14:46.900,00:14:47.945,However...
,,,00:14:48.321,00:14:49.575,What is wrong?
00:14:48.550,00:14:51.380,只是娘娘的胎像略有不稳,00:14:49.650,00:14:52.749,Her Highness's prenatal qi seems unstable
00:14:52.220,00:14:53.260,需要好好静养,00:14:53.320,00:14:54.880,and undisturbed rest is needed.
00:14:54.140,00:14:57.680,为保万全恐怕不能与之过分亲近,00:14:55.214,00:14:59.040,"To be safe, it would be prudent
to avoid intimate contact with her."
00:14:59.890,00:15:04.230,你尽心尽力照顾好莞嫔,00:15:00.990,00:15:05.330,Spare no effort to take care of Concubine Sourire.
00:15:05.440,00:15:08.270,太医院的事平时应卯即可,00:15:06.540,00:15:10.319,"After the Infirmary takes attendance at five,
you will have no other tasks there."
00:15:09.450,00:15:09.930,是,,,
00:15:10.150,00:15:10.770,平身吧,00:15:10.550,00:15:12.261,"- Yes, Your Majesty.
- You may rise."
00:15:12.030,00:15:12.690,谢皇上,00:15:13.130,00:15:14.492,I thank Your Majesty.
00:15:14.490,00:15:16.950,槿汐拿些水来,00:15:15.590,00:15:18.409,"Jinxi, bring me some water."
00:15:23.000,00:15:23.710,皇上,00:15:24.100,00:15:25.211,Your Majesty.
00:15:24.340,00:15:26.450,都什么时候了还讲这样的规矩,00:15:25.440,00:15:27.819,There is no need for such formality.
00:15:28.840,00:15:30.170,皇上什么时候来的,,,
00:15:31.090,00:15:31.880,我竟不知道,00:15:29.940,00:15:31.629,When did Your Majesty come?
00:15:33.050,00:15:34.290,槿汐也不叫醒我,00:15:32.190,00:15:33.846,I wasn't even aware of your arrival.
00:15:34.760,00:15:36.170,皇上来了半个时辰了,00:15:34.150,00:15:35.800,"Jinxi, why didn't you wake me up?"
,,,00:15:35.860,00:15:37.405,His Majesty has been here for an hour already
00:15:36.680,00:15:39.470,见娘娘睡得好不忍心叫醒娘娘,00:15:37.780,00:15:40.653,but didn't want to wake Your Highness from your restful sleep.
00:15:39.770,00:15:42.260,是朕叫槿汐别叫你,00:15:40.870,00:15:43.402,I was the one who told Jinxi not to wake you up
00:15:42.850,00:15:44.010,特意叫你多睡会儿,00:15:43.950,00:15:45.552,so you could sleep longer.
00:15:45.270,00:15:47.480,苏培盛告诉朕你有了身孕,00:15:46.370,00:15:48.663,Su Peisheng told you me are pregnant.
00:15:48.150,00:15:49.360,朕欢喜得很,00:15:49.250,00:15:50.720,I'm absolutely delighted.
00:15:51.700,00:15:52.730,皇上也真是的,,,
00:15:53.530,00:15:54.610,欢喜便欢喜吧,00:15:52.800,00:15:53.955,"Your Majesty,"
00:15:55.120,00:15:56.360,不拘哪一日来都行,00:15:54.630,00:15:55.877,even if you were pleased
,,,00:15:56.220,00:15:57.848,you needn't have come here today.
00:15:57.160,00:15:59.370,今儿外头下着雨山路又不好走,00:15:58.260,00:16:00.720,The rain has made the mountain roads difficult to traverse.
00:15:59.830,00:16:01.240,何必要巴巴赶过来呢,00:16:00.930,00:16:02.549,Your Majesty didn't need to rush over here.
00:16:02.170,00:16:04.530,你有了身孕是天大的喜事,00:16:03.270,00:16:05.630,Your pregnancy is the most joyful news.
00:16:04.920,00:16:05.910,朕高兴得很,00:16:06.020,00:16:07.344,I'm very happy.
00:16:07.000,00:16:08.370,到底是你的福气好,00:16:08.100,00:16:09.595,"You are also very blessed,"
00:16:09.050,00:16:11.380,朕第一次来看你你就有了孩子,00:16:10.150,00:16:12.522,becoming pregnant from my first visit.
00:16:12.300,00:16:13.130,皇上,,,
00:16:13.590,00:16:14.550,朕是担心你,00:16:13.400,00:16:14.439,Your Majesty.
00:16:15.220,00:16:17.180,温太医说你胎像不稳,00:16:14.690,00:16:16.128,I say that because I'm worried.
00:16:17.680,00:16:19.470,又说不许这样不许那样,00:16:16.320,00:16:18.488,Dr. Wen said your pregnancy is unstable
00:16:19.850,00:16:20.880,朕可担心极了,00:16:18.780,00:16:20.570,and many things are not allowed.
,,,00:16:20.783,00:16:22.356,I'm very worried about you.
00:16:22.350,00:16:24.970,还要四郎这样挂心当真是,00:16:23.450,00:16:26.236,"Si Lang, it's my fault for making you worry about me."
00:16:25.810,00:16:27.050,若非你有了身孕,,,
00:16:27.820,00:16:29.100,宫里的事这样多,00:16:26.910,00:16:28.320,"With everything going on in the palace,"
00:16:29.570,00:16:31.850,朕真没个高兴的所在了,00:16:28.920,00:16:30.951,"if you weren't pregnant,"
,,,00:16:30.951,00:16:33.117,I'd have nothing to be happy about.
00:16:33.650,00:16:37.490,来朕叫他们把炖好的,00:16:34.750,00:16:35.842,"Here,"
00:16:38.330,00:16:40.820,燕窝带来热一热浇上牛乳,00:16:36.092,00:16:42.012,I had them prepare some bird's nest soup and heat it up here with some milk.
00:16:41.200,00:16:42.320,从前你最爱吃了,00:16:42.012,00:16:43.759,It was always your favorite.

00:17:01.970,00:17:03.340,长相思还在你这儿,00:17:03.070,00:17:04.844,Endless Longing is still in your possession.
00:17:04.890,00:17:07.430,你离宫三年再也没有人能弹出,00:17:05.990,00:17:08.530,"In the three years since you left,"
00:17:07.810,00:17:09.050,那么有情致的曲调了,00:17:08.530,00:17:10.822,no one else has played music as expressively as you did.
00:17:11.610,00:17:13.980,好好的怎么又掉眼泪了,00:17:12.710,00:17:15.289,What's wrong? Why are you tearing up?
00:17:16.410,00:17:18.150,嬛嬛久不弹长相思,00:17:17.510,00:17:20.220,I haven't played Endless Longing in a long time.
00:17:19.120,00:17:20.450,只觉恍如隔世,00:17:20.220,00:17:21.909,This feels like another life now.
00:17:22.370,00:17:25.330,朕再得你在身边亦如隔世,00:17:23.470,00:17:26.430,"Now that you are by my side again,
I also feel like ages have passed."
00:17:30.800,00:17:32.000,随朕回宫吧,00:17:31.900,00:17:33.758,Return to the palace with me.
00:17:35.880,00:17:39.130,嬛嬛是废妃还是不祥之身,00:17:36.980,00:17:40.768,"Your Majesty, I am a banished concubine
and an inauspicious presence."
00:17:40.890,00:17:42.220,即便身怀龙裔,00:17:41.990,00:17:43.946,"Although I am pregnant with an imperial heir,"
00:17:43.060,00:17:45.220,也不敢再妄想能够再回宫廷了,00:17:44.160,00:17:46.654,I do not think I deserve to return to the palace.
00:17:45.980,00:17:50.440,既是废妃就重新再册随朕回宫,00:17:47.080,00:17:50.242,"You were banished, but I can confer a new title on you."
,,,00:17:50.451,00:17:52.207,So you can come back with me.
00:17:52.940,00:17:55.180,那太后会不会不允,00:17:54.040,00:17:56.280,Won't the Empress Dowager disapprove?
00:17:55.490,00:17:56.520,你现有了子嗣,,,
00:17:57.150,00:17:58.610,太后想必不会阻才阑,00:17:56.590,00:18:00.000,"I doubt the Empress Dowager will forbid it
knowing you are pregnant."
00:18:03.160,00:18:04.870,朕为你安排好就是,00:18:04.260,00:18:06.723,I will make all the necessary arrangements for you.
00:18:12.300,00:18:15.540,你说什么甄嬛有了身孕,00:18:13.400,00:18:16.640,What? You said Zhen Huan is pregnant?
00:18:15.920,00:18:16.750,千真万确,,,
00:18:17.220,00:18:18.920,奴才亲眼见温太医,00:18:16.818,00:18:18.080,I am certain.
00:18:19.220,00:18:20.460,在太医院配的是安胎药,00:18:18.320,00:18:21.635,"I saw with my own eyes that Dr. Wen
was preparing prenatal herbs,"
00:18:20.850,00:18:23.010,可宫中并无小主怀孕,00:18:21.950,00:18:24.235,but no concubine in the palace is pregnant.
00:18:23.310,00:18:24.640,能让温太医照顾的,,,
00:18:24.930,00:18:26.840,也就只有凌云峰的那一位了,00:18:24.410,00:18:27.983,"Only the one at Peak Lingyun has the privilege
of being looked after by Dr. Wen."
00:18:27.480,00:18:28.180,出去吧,,,
00:18:29.060,00:18:29.640,嘛,00:18:28.540,00:18:29.782,Leave now.
00:18:33.270,00:18:34.430,千防万防,00:18:30.167,00:18:30.880,Yes.
00:18:34.780,00:18:36.560,还是防不住那个狐媚子的肚子,00:18:34.231,00:18:37.755,"Despite our careful measures, we still
weren't able to defend against that minx's belly."
00:18:37.190,00:18:38.480,没有孩子还好说,00:18:38.226,00:18:40.375,It would have been all right if she weren't pregnant.
00:18:38.990,00:18:41.950,那么快就有了孩子 那就难办了,00:18:40.375,00:18:43.436,But her conceiving a child so soon ... makes everything difficult.
00:18:42.740,00:18:43.400,娘娘,00:18:43.840,00:18:44.834,"Your Majesty,"
00:18:43.950,00:18:45.860,咱们好不容易让宫里清净了,00:18:45.026,00:18:47.145,we finally restored peace in the harem.
00:18:46.450,00:18:48.190,若让甄嬛怀着孩子回来,00:18:47.542,00:18:49.699,"If Zhen Huan comes back with a child,"
00:18:48.870,00:18:51.030,只怕这宫里要有大变,00:18:49.953,00:18:52.363,it might cause great disturbances in the palace.
00:18:52.540,00:18:54.580,皇后娘娘您得想想法子呀,00:18:53.640,00:18:55.840,"Your Majesty, you must think of a way."
00:18:56.010,00:18:58.090,虽然没有废妃回宫的先例,00:18:57.086,00:18:59.829,"Although there is no precedent for a banished concubine to return,"
00:18:58.920,00:19:02.710,但无论如何本宫不许她回宫,00:19:00.075,00:19:03.865,I will still find other ways to stop her.
00:19:03.640,00:19:05.750,眼下只有把她困在宫外,00:19:04.700,00:19:07.466,"For the time being, we must keep her out of the palace,"
00:19:06.430,00:19:09.600,才能斩草除根免去后患,00:19:07.466,00:19:10.636,"so that we can ""cut the roots to eliminate the weed."""
00:19:13.270,00:19:14.140,娘娘不好了,,,
00:19:14.650,00:19:16.510,太后方才发病又晕过去了,00:19:14.353,00:19:15.709,"Your Majesty, terrible news!"
00:19:19.070,00:19:20.150,赶紧盼咐宝华殿,00:19:15.709,00:19:17.986,the Empress Dowager had a fainting episode again.
00:19:20.530,00:19:21.520,为太后诵经祈福,00:19:20.043,00:19:22.678,"Quickly, order Baohua Hall to pray for Her Majesty."
00:19:21.950,00:19:22.560,是,,,
00:19:23.030,00:19:23.900,再准备下去,00:19:22.883,00:19:23.835,Yes.
00:19:24.200,00:19:26.410,明日早上本宫要亲自去那儿上香,00:19:24.002,00:19:27.162,"Also, get everything prepared for me to
 offer incense tomorrow morning"
00:19:26.740,00:19:27.480,为太后祈福,00:19:27.162,00:19:28.807,and pray for Her Majesty.
00:19:32.380,00:19:36.210,小姐生绢束腹会不会伤着胎儿,00:19:33.480,00:19:37.310,"My Lady, will the raw silk wrapping be bad for the baby?"
00:19:37.340,00:19:38.200,应该不会,00:19:38.440,00:19:39.750,It shouldn't be.
00:19:39.340,00:19:42.550,温太医说了汉灵帝的王美人,00:19:40.440,00:19:43.650,Dr. Wen told me about Consort Wang of Emperor Ling of Han.
00:19:43.140,00:19:44.970,因为惧怕何皇后的威势,00:19:44.160,00:19:46.384,"Fearing Empress He's powers,"
00:19:46.260,00:19:47.880,有了身孕也不敢言说,00:19:47.384,00:19:49.684,Consort Wang daren't mention her pregnancy.
00:19:48.640,00:19:51.850,每日束腹一直瞒到生育之前,00:19:49.684,00:19:53.062,She wrapped her stomach every day until just before birth.
00:19:54.770,00:19:57.640,何况我两三日束一日,00:19:55.671,00:19:58.750,"Besides, I am only wrapping once every two or three days."
00:19:58.280,00:19:59.940,只消束上两三个月即可,00:19:59.277,00:20:01.312,And it will only be for two or three months.
00:20:00.780,00:20:02.060,且不必束得太紧,00:20:01.840,00:20:03.537,I won't make it too tight.
00:20:03.530,00:20:05.440,温大人还开了固胎的药来,00:20:04.566,00:20:06.827,Dr. Wen also prescribed some stablizing tonics.
00:20:06.240,00:20:07.820,再穿上这宽大的衣裳,00:20:07.340,00:20:09.287,"Wearing this loose-fitting robe,"
00:20:09.120,00:20:10.910,还真的跟一个多月差不多呢,00:20:10.220,00:20:12.574,you do look just about one month pregnant.
00:20:13.920,00:20:15.370,只要皇上不与我亲近,,,
00:20:16.340,00:20:17.500,便可瞒天过海,00:20:14.956,00:20:18.809,"As long as His Majesty does not get intimate with me,
I can ""cross the ocean without Heaven's notice."""
00:20:31.560,00:20:33.970,温大人你可有嬛儿的消息吗,00:20:32.508,00:20:35.040,"Dr. Wen, do you have news of Huan'er?"
00:20:34.980,00:20:36.840,她确是有消息让微臣带给你,00:20:36.055,00:20:38.040,She did ask me to deliver a message.
00:20:37.360,00:20:38.020,什么,00:20:38.420,00:20:39.492,What is it?
00:20:38.440,00:20:40.680,嬛儿她怀孕了,00:20:39.659,00:20:41.899,Huan'er ... She's pregnant.
00:20:42.360,00:20:43.940,皇上或许准她回宫,00:20:43.491,00:20:45.322,His Majesty may allow her to return.
00:20:45.530,00:20:46.240,真的,00:20:46.677,00:20:47.554,Really?
00:20:48.950,00:20:50.190,只是回宫之事,,,
00:20:50.660,00:20:52.370,只是皇上一个人说了还不算,00:20:49.986,00:20:53.607,"However, this requires more than His Majesty's approval."
00:20:52.830,00:20:53.990,还需要太后来点头,00:20:53.607,00:20:55.461,It also needs a nod from the Empress Dowager.
00:20:54.670,00:20:56.250,你日日服侍在太后身边,00:20:55.690,00:20:57.715,You attend the Empress Dowager every day.
00:20:56.920,00:20:58.450,若是太后提及此事,00:20:57.964,00:20:59.813,"If the Empress Dowager mentions this matter,"
00:20:59.090,00:21:01.200,还希望您多多为嬛儿说话,00:21:00.102,00:21:02.212,please put in a good word for Huan'er.
00:21:01.550,00:21:03.330,是是那是自然的,00:21:02.555,00:21:04.444,"Yes, yes, of course."
00:21:05.800,00:21:07.040,回宫只是个开头,00:21:06.883,00:21:08.274,Returning to the palace is just the beginning.
00:21:07.970,00:21:10.680,往后的路怕还是千难万难的,00:21:09.070,00:21:11.780,The road ahead is still long and arduous.
00:21:11.560,00:21:13.260,娘娘可要有个准备才是,00:21:12.635,00:21:14.627,Your Highness needs to be prepared.
00:21:15.020,00:21:16.010,若是皇后和安氏,,,
00:21:16.400,00:21:17.600,知道娘娘要回宫了,00:21:16.104,00:21:19.079,"Once the Empress and An Lingrong
learn Your Highness is returning,"
00:21:18.400,00:21:20.180,也必不肯善罢甘休的,00:21:19.476,00:21:21.256,they will not back down easily.
00:21:21.690,00:21:23.680,皇上是铁了心要接我回去,00:21:22.790,00:21:24.863,His Majesty has made an ironclad decision.
00:21:24.570,00:21:25.810,皇后未必阻斓得了,00:21:25.622,00:21:27.305,It's unlikely the Empress can reverse it.
00:21:27.030,00:21:29.520,只怕她顺水推舟来个请君入瓮,00:21:28.130,00:21:31.640,"So she might ""help launch the boat into the current,""
knowing it leads to treacherous rapids ahead."
00:21:30.580,00:21:31.740,只待我回宫之后,00:21:31.680,00:21:33.120,"Once I am back,"
00:21:32.450,00:21:34.570,再用她的中宫之权来对我动手,00:21:33.470,00:21:36.216,"she will use her power as head of the
 harem to scheme against me."
00:21:35.660,00:21:36.740,倒是不易应对了,,,
00:21:37.830,00:21:39.200,想不到这几年宫中,00:21:36.735,00:21:38.357,That will be hard to counter.
00:21:39.920,00:21:41.750,竟然没有一个人能与她抗衡,00:21:38.913,00:21:42.810,"I never expected her power
to be unchecked for all these years."
00:21:42.550,00:21:43.580,她也算得意够了,00:21:43.639,00:21:44.680,Her luck is about to end!
00:21:44.720,00:21:46.380,不过即便她真要做什么,,,
00:21:46.800,00:21:47.590,那也是枉然,00:21:45.820,00:21:48.988,"But even if she attempts something, it will be futile."
00:21:48.720,00:21:50.300,小姐若以妃位回宫,,,
00:21:51.010,00:21:52.630,不出几个月生下孩子,00:21:49.804,00:21:51.801,"If My Lady returns as a Consort,"
00:21:53.020,00:21:53.930,便是根基稳固,00:21:52.062,00:21:54.990,"and gives birth in a few months,
your position will be securely rooted."
00:21:55.020,00:21:57.430,到那个时候小姐要和她斗,,,
00:21:58.310,00:21:59.390,也未必没有资本,00:21:56.120,00:22:00.434,"By then, you will have the ability to contend with her, if you wish."
00:22:01.320,00:22:03.730,只盼小姐身在荣华富贵中,00:22:02.396,00:22:05.489,"I only hope that after you return to opulence and luxury, My Lady,"
00:22:04.820,00:22:06.430,可千万不要忘了咱们的恨,00:22:05.920,00:22:08.072,you do not forget the hatred in our hearts.
00:22:09.030,00:22:10.570,娘子不好了,00:22:10.090,00:22:11.630,"Mistress, help!"
00:22:11.410,00:22:12.190,太妃她,00:22:12.406,00:22:13.744,The Consort Dowager...
00:22:13.370,00:22:15.490,她从阿晋那儿知道王爷的死讯,00:22:14.382,00:22:16.824,"She heard the news of His Lordship's death from Ajin,"
00:22:16.080,00:22:17.660,已经整整三日不吃不喝,00:22:17.029,00:22:18.915,and has refused to eat for three days and nights.
00:22:18.080,00:22:19.040,怎么劝都不听,00:22:18.915,00:22:20.524,She won't listen to anybody.
00:22:21.420,00:22:22.660,带我去瞧瞧太妃,00:22:22.542,00:22:24.496,Bring me to see Her Venerable Highness.
00:22:37.770,00:22:40.760,姑姑请且出去我陪太妃说说话,00:22:38.870,00:22:41.985,"Please leave us for a moment, madam.
I will accompany Her Venerable Highness."
00:23:00.880,00:23:01.990,逝者已逝,00:23:01.980,00:23:03.591,The dead have passed on.
00:23:04.300,00:23:09.380,难道生者也要个个都跟着去吗,00:23:04.996,00:23:06.799,Do the living ...
,,,00:23:08.548,00:23:10.605,have to join them?
00:23:12.140,00:23:14.500,我又何尝不想跟着允礼一起去呢,00:23:12.965,00:23:16.051,There isn't a moment that I haven't wanted to join Yunli.
00:23:16.180,00:23:17.170,一了百了,00:23:16.674,00:23:19.204,"Ending my life would put an end to it all,"
00:23:18.680,00:23:20.350,便什么烦恼都没有了,00:23:19.780,00:23:21.742,leaving me with no more worries.
00:23:23.940,00:23:25.600,难道太妃只要儿子,00:23:24.758,00:23:27.317,"Would Your Venerable Highness care only for your son,"
00:23:28.030,00:23:29.560,就不要孙子了吗,00:23:29.130,00:23:30.880,not your grandson?
00:23:33.160,00:23:34.490,我这肚子里的孩子,00:23:34.260,00:23:35.715,The child in my belly
00:23:35.870,00:23:37.860,还等着唤太妃祖母呢,00:23:36.970,00:23:39.127,is waiting to call Your Venerable Highness grandmother.
00:23:40.870,00:23:42.450,孩子已经没了父亲,00:23:41.970,00:23:43.675,The child has lost his father.
00:23:44.340,00:23:46.370,难道太妃也要离他而去吗,00:23:45.440,00:23:47.877,Will Your Venerable Highness also leave him behind?
,,,00:23:54.610,00:23:56.945,"Your Majesty,"
00:23:53.510,00:24:03.850,先帝我与你就这么一个儿子,00:23:59.780,00:24:04.950,I had only one son with you.
00:24:06.610,00:24:10.650,我竟没有好好地看住他呀,00:24:07.710,00:24:11.750,But I didn't take good care of him.
,,,00:24:14.380,00:24:16.149,Now...
00:24:13.280,00:24:21.700,如今如今我是白发人送黑发人,00:24:16.320,00:24:22.971,"""A gray-haired parent has to lament the black-haired child."""
00:24:26.670,00:24:31.410,允礼呀允礼 你要做父亲了,00:24:27.770,00:24:30.464,Yunli ... Yunli ...
,,,00:24:30.464,00:24:32.802,You are going to be a father.
00:24:33.470,00:24:39.710,可是你你却看不到了,00:24:34.570,00:24:36.496,But you can't ...
,,,00:24:38.122,00:24:40.810,You can't see your child.
00:24:49.780,00:24:52.890,嬛儿你有身孕在身,00:24:50.880,00:24:53.990,"Huan’er, you are with child."
00:24:54.200,00:24:58.780,切不可悲伤过度 快别哭了,00:24:55.300,00:24:57.508,Don't let grief overcome you.
,,,00:24:58.718,00:25:00.756,Please stop crying.
00:25:02.000,00:25:05.780,太妃您吃点饭吧,00:25:03.100,00:25:04.807,"Your Venerable Highness,"
,,,00:25:05.599,00:25:07.547,please have some food.
00:25:07.420,00:25:11.210,好我吃些便是,00:25:08.520,00:25:09.727,Yes.
,,,00:25:10.769,00:25:12.852,I'll eat something.
00:25:14.010,00:25:17.220,积云积云拿饭菜进来,00:25:15.110,00:25:15.890,"Nebular,"
,,,00:25:16.159,00:25:16.907,"Nebular,"
00:25:17.680,00:25:18.290,来了,00:25:17.176,00:25:18.880,bring in the meal.
,,,00:25:18.880,00:25:19.704,Yes.
00:25:45.000,00:25:47.910,太妃以后恐怕,00:25:46.100,00:25:47.520,"Your Venerable Highness,"
,,,00:25:47.867,00:25:49.010,I'm afraid...
00:25:49.460,00:25:51.000,我都不能来安栖观了,00:25:50.560,00:25:52.320,I won't be able to visit here anymore.
00:25:52.710,00:25:53.500,为什么,00:25:53.810,00:25:54.850,Why?
00:25:57.260,00:26:02.170,皇上的意思想要我回宫侍奉,00:25:58.360,00:26:00.096,His Majesty...
,,,00:26:01.597,00:26:03.979,wants me to return to the palace to serve him.
00:26:04.220,00:26:05.300,我已经答应了,00:26:05.320,00:26:06.720,I have agreed.
00:26:11.570,00:26:14.480,你要回宫也无妨,00:26:12.670,00:26:15.830,There's no harm ... in you returning to the palace.
00:26:16.030,00:26:20.020,皇帝的旨意你也不能违抗,00:26:17.130,00:26:21.120,And you can’t defy ... the Emperor's decree.
00:26:23.580,00:26:25.740,只是你肚子里的孩子,00:26:24.680,00:26:26.840,But the child in your belly…
00:26:28.670,00:26:32.750,皇上以为这孩子是他的,00:26:29.770,00:26:31.370,His Majesty thinks...
,,,00:26:32.287,00:26:34.267,the child is his.
00:26:35.960,00:26:37.670,所以执意要我回宫,00:26:37.060,00:26:38.937,so he insists that I return to the palace.
00:26:42.760,00:26:45.000,允礼尸骨未寒,00:26:43.860,00:26:46.100,Yunli's body isn't even cold yet.
00:26:45.970,00:26:51.440,你 你竟要我的孙儿,00:26:47.070,00:26:48.664,How can you...
,,,00:26:49.248,00:26:52.665,make my grandson
00:26:51.900,00:26:54.310,认别人做父亲你,00:26:53.124,00:26:55.493,call another man father?
00:27:00.530,00:27:01.820,太妃您知道吗,,,
00:27:02.700,00:27:04.110,允礼的死并不是意外,00:27:01.630,00:27:03.337,"Your Venerable Highness, did you know that"
00:27:04.490,00:27:05.700,他是被人害死的,00:27:03.800,00:27:05.377,Yunli's death was not an accident.
00:27:06.910,00:27:08.530,允礼坐的船被人动了手脚,00:27:05.377,00:27:06.960,He was murdered!
00:27:09.290,00:27:10.750,才会命丧黄河,00:27:08.010,00:27:10.000,"Someone tampered with his ship,"
,,,00:27:10.181,00:27:12.100,causing his death in the Yellow River.
00:27:11.000,00:27:13.660,我从没有认为允礼的死是个意外,00:27:12.100,00:27:14.760,I never thought Yunli's death was an accident!
00:27:15.090,00:27:16.330,允礼死不瞑目,00:27:16.136,00:27:18.366,"He ""died with unmet desires in his eyes."""
00:27:17.260,00:27:18.870,我是一定要替他报仇的,00:27:18.366,00:27:20.000,I swear to avenge his murder.
00:27:21.300,00:27:23.260,可恨我只是个弱女子,00:27:22.400,00:27:25.253, How I wish I was not just a powerless woman...
00:27:25.060,00:27:25.920,可是你,,,
00:27:26.310,00:27:28.800,一定要带我的孙儿回宫吗,00:27:26.160,00:27:30.000,But do you have to take my grandson to the palace?
00:27:30.810,00:27:32.140,我也不想这样,00:27:31.910,00:27:33.772,I didn't want it to be this way either.
00:27:34.190,00:27:35.300,可是只有这样,00:27:35.290,00:27:36.817,But this is the only way
00:27:36.570,00:27:38.020,我才能替允礼报仇,00:27:37.670,00:27:39.454,that I can avenge Yunli's death
00:27:38.780,00:27:40.560,才能保住我们的孩子,00:27:39.880,00:27:41.760,and protect our child.
00:27:41.910,00:27:42.770,也只有这样,00:27:43.010,00:27:44.329,And only this way
00:27:44.160,00:27:45.860,我才能保全我的家人,00:27:45.260,00:27:47.085,can I protect my family.
00:27:50.080,00:27:51.450,太妃您知道吗,00:27:51.180,00:27:53.217,"Your Venerable Highness, can you imagine"
00:27:54.130,00:27:55.710,与其让我这样活着,00:27:55.230,00:27:57.102,how much I want to go with Yunli
00:27:57.500,00:27:58.990,还不如让我死了,00:27:58.600,00:28:00.382,if I have to live like this.
00:28:01.680,00:28:05.380,可是为了允礼为了我们的孩子,00:28:02.780,00:28:06.480,"But for Yunli, and for our child,"
00:28:06.050,00:28:07.340,为了甄氏一族,00:28:07.150,00:28:08.774,"and also for the Zhen clan,"
00:28:09.020,00:28:13.100,再难我也要去做,00:28:10.000,00:28:11.749,"I have to do this,"
,,,00:28:12.587,00:28:14.720,no matter how difficult it is.
00:29:09.240,00:29:09.860,回宫,00:29:10.340,00:29:11.293,Let's leave.
00:29:17.210,00:29:19.920,方才的事太不吉利不准说出去,00:29:17.800,00:29:21.656,"What happened just now was inauspicious.
Don't tell anyone about it."
00:29:21.130,00:29:22.240,娘娘心情郁结,,,
00:29:22.550,00:29:24.250,不如在御花园散散心吧,00:29:22.230,00:29:23.650,"Your Majesty is in low spirits,"
00:29:24.720,00:29:25.880,咱们去桥边赏鱼吧,00:29:23.650,00:29:25.820,why not take a walk in the imperial garden?
00:29:27.140,00:29:28.000,太后病重,00:29:25.820,00:29:27.314,Let's admire the fish by the bridge.
00:29:28.220,00:29:30.050,本宫如何有心情在此闲游,00:29:28.240,00:29:29.487,The Empress Dowager is acutely ill.
00:29:30.470,00:29:31.590,还是早些回宫去吧,00:29:29.487,00:29:31.316,I am not in the mood to meander around.
00:29:32.180,00:29:32.800,是,00:29:31.570,00:29:32.690,Let's go back now.
,,,00:29:33.280,00:29:33.900,Yes.
00:29:35.730,00:29:38.140,娘娘 娘娘 你怎么了娘娘,00:29:36.830,00:29:39.240,"- Your Majesty!
- Are you all right, Your Majesty?"
00:29:38.770,00:29:39.640,来人快去叫太医,,,
00:29:40.020,00:29:40.600,传太医,00:29:39.411,00:29:40.740,"Go, call the doctor!"
00:29:40.980,00:29:41.770,娘娘,00:29:40.740,00:29:41.487,Call the doctor!
,,,00:29:42.080,00:29:42.870,Your Majesty!
00:30:23.110,00:30:25.820,走水了 护驾 快护驾,00:30:24.210,00:30:26.920,"- It's on fire!
- Protect Her Majesty!"
00:30:26.150,00:30:27.230,走水了 护驾,00:30:27.250,00:30:28.330,"- Bring water!
- Save Her Majesty!"
00:30:27.650,00:30:30.650,快来人哪 护驾 快护驾,00:30:28.750,00:30:31.750,"- Someone get help!
- Help Her Majesty!"
00:30:30.910,00:30:33.320,来人哪 快来人哪 走水了,00:30:32.010,00:30:33.846,"- Fire! Help!
 -Bring water!"
00:30:33.580,00:30:35.940,走水了 寿康宫走水了,00:30:34.680,00:30:37.040,Fire! The Palace of Longevity is on fire!
00:30:36.370,00:30:39.160,快走水了 寿康宫走水了,00:30:37.470,00:30:40.260,"Hurry! There's a fire!
At the Palace of Longevity!"
00:30:40.040,00:30:43.250,走水了 寿康宫走水了 快,00:30:41.140,00:30:44.350,Fire! At the Palace of Longevity! Go!
00:30:43.880,00:30:44.460,走水了,,,
00:30:46.130,00:30:48.120,皇后一向端庄持重,00:30:47.230,00:30:49.429,You've always been composed and prudent.
00:30:49.510,00:30:51.120,怎么会失足扭伤呢,00:30:50.610,00:30:52.480,How could you sprain your ankle?
00:30:52.220,00:30:53.960,定是你们服侍不当心,00:30:53.320,00:30:55.352,It must be the carelessness of the servants.
00:30:54.970,00:30:56.130,不干奴才们的事,00:30:56.070,00:30:57.647,It's not because of them.
00:30:56.890,00:30:58.380,是臣妾自己不小心,00:30:57.990,00:30:59.480,I should have been more careful.
00:30:59.140,00:31:00.980,还好伤得不重,00:31:00.240,00:31:02.080,"Fortunately, it's not very serious."
00:31:02.060,00:31:03.400,你去瞰了怎么回事,00:31:03.160,00:31:04.667,You investigated it. What happened?
00:31:03.980,00:31:05.440,石板有松动的痕述,00:31:05.080,00:31:06.832,"The slate pavers show signs of loosening,"
00:31:05.940,00:31:09.030,所以娘娘才会走路不稳失足扭伤,00:31:07.040,00:31:10.130,which caused Her Majesty to lose her footing.
00:31:10.030,00:31:13.240,这么说都是本宫粗心大意了,00:31:11.130,00:31:14.340,It was just me being careless then.
00:31:13.580,00:31:15.860,可是娘娘方才在宝华殿上香时,00:31:14.680,00:31:16.960,"But when Your Majesty was praying at Baohua Hall,"
00:31:16.290,00:31:18.650,就断了两次香实在不吉呀,00:31:17.390,00:31:20.000,"the incense broke twice, which is really inauspicious."
00:31:19.120,00:31:19.950,不许胡说,00:31:20.220,00:31:21.509,Don't talk nonsense.
00:31:21.540,00:31:23.830,皇上 太后宫里走水了,00:31:22.640,00:31:25.055,"Your Majesty, a fire was put out at the Palace of Longevity."
00:31:25.500,00:31:26.240,怎么回事,,,
00:31:27.300,00:31:28.630,太后有没有受伤啊,00:31:26.600,00:31:27.590,How come?
00:31:29.010,00:31:31.090,太后晕厥未醒 没有受惊,00:31:28.400,00:31:30.000,Did the Empress Dowager get hurt?
00:31:31.390,00:31:32.090,也没有受伤,00:31:30.110,00:31:33.160,"Her Majesty was unconscious
so she wasn't hurt or frightened."
00:31:32.390,00:31:34.130,幸好火势不大已经扑灭了,00:31:33.490,00:31:35.563,Luckily the fire didn't spread before it was put out.
00:31:35.180,00:31:39.010,那就好朕得去看看太后,00:31:36.280,00:31:40.110,Good. I must visit Her Majesty.
00:31:39.520,00:31:40.100,皇上,00:31:40.620,00:31:41.492,"Your Majesty,"
00:31:41.100,00:31:43.390,臣妾有句话不知当讲不当讲,00:31:42.200,00:31:44.490, I have something to say but I'm not sure if it's appropriate.
00:31:43.560,00:31:44.140,你说,00:31:44.660,00:31:45.540,Say it.
00:31:44.440,00:31:46.770,皇后与太后在同一日先后受惊,00:31:45.540,00:31:47.870,"Their Majesties have both a fright on the same day,"
00:31:47.110,00:31:48.650,一个扭伤一个失火,00:31:48.210,00:31:50.167,"one had a sprained ankle, the other caught in a fire."
00:31:49.240,00:31:50.100,臣妾惶恐,00:31:50.340,00:31:51.520,I feel unsettled.
00:31:50.860,00:31:53.150,不如请钦天监过来看看吧,00:31:51.960,00:31:54.815,Shouldn't we consult the Astrological Office?
00:31:56.280,00:31:59.240,朕先去寿康宫苏培盛,00:31:57.380,00:32:00.340,"I will first visit the Palace of Longevity.
 Su Peisheng."
00:31:59.750,00:32:00.410,奴才在,00:32:00.850,00:32:01.885,Your Majesty.
00:32:01.160,00:32:04.780,晚膳后传钦天监到养心殿见朕,00:32:02.260,00:32:05.880,"Summon the astrological officials
to the Hall of Mental Cultivation after dinner."
00:32:05.000,00:32:05.620,嗻,00:32:06.100,00:32:07.012,Aye.
00:32:15.850,00:32:17.460,微臣叩见皇上,00:32:16.950,00:32:18.810,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:32:17.970,00:32:18.630,起来吧,00:32:19.070,00:32:20.000,Rise.
00:32:20.060,00:32:22.850,今日太后和皇后屡遭厄困,00:32:21.160,00:32:23.950,"Today the Empress Dowager and the Empress
both encountered misfortunes,"
00:32:24.100,00:32:26.350,宫中不是失火就是扭伤的,00:32:25.200,00:32:27.659,"one caught in a fire, the other spraining her ankle."
00:32:27.320,00:32:28.680,可是天象有异吗,,,
00:32:29.070,00:32:30.600,微臣正想来禀报,00:32:28.258,00:32:30.170,Are there any abnormal signs in Heaven?
,,,00:32:30.170,00:32:31.992,I was going to report to Your Majesty.
00:32:31.320,00:32:33.860,微臣前几日夜观天象,00:32:32.420,00:32:35.127,"While observing astrological phenomena over the past few nights,"
00:32:34.450,00:32:37.490,发觉本应北方玄武七宿中,00:32:35.550,00:32:38.840,"I found that among the seven lunar mansions
of the Black Tortoise of the North,"
00:32:37.740,00:32:40.530,十月才明亮的危月燕星,00:32:38.840,00:32:41.755,"the Roof mansion, which is supposed to illuminate in October,"
00:32:40.870,00:32:42.110,突然大放异彩,00:32:41.970,00:32:43.560,suddenly brightened up.
00:32:42.460,00:32:44.820,尾带小星有冲月之势,00:32:43.560,00:32:46.180,"Carrying a small star at the tail,
it has the momentum to impinge on the moon."
00:32:45.080,00:32:45.910,危月燕,00:32:46.180,00:32:47.310,The Roof mansion?
00:32:46.210,00:32:49.370,是危月燕乃北方星宿,00:32:47.310,00:32:50.470,Yes. It is a mansion in the north
00:32:49.710,00:32:52.420,危者高也高而有险,00:32:50.810,00:32:53.520,which portends height and danger.
00:32:52.760,00:32:56.000,故星相大凶因其危月,00:32:53.860,00:32:57.183,"This astrological phenomenon is
highly inauspicious as it threatens the moon."
00:32:56.300,00:33:00.420,宫中主月者一是太后二是皇后,00:32:57.400,00:33:01.520,"In the palace, the Empress Dowager
and the Empress are masters of the Moon."
00:33:01.100,00:33:02.930,而其尾带小星,00:33:02.200,00:33:04.364,"Additionally, the small star on its tail"
00:33:03.560,00:33:07.270,只怕更指北方高处女子有孕,00:33:04.660,00:33:08.537,"could signify a pregnant woman
residing in a place of elevation in the north."
00:33:07.940,00:33:10.770,会危害太后与皇后安康,00:33:09.040,00:33:12.003,"This woman could endanger the well-being of
the Empress Dowager and the Empress."
00:33:11.070,00:33:12.230,此人可在宫中吗,00:33:12.003,00:33:13.330,Is this woman in the palace now?
00:33:12.530,00:33:15.140,还没有看其冲月之势,00:33:13.630,00:33:14.901,Not presently.
00:33:15.660,00:33:17.190,看来还在宫外,00:33:14.901,00:33:18.440,"From the star's trajectory towards the moon,
this woman is still outside of the palace,"
00:33:17.910,00:33:19.860,只是渐渐逼近宫中,00:33:19.010,00:33:20.960,but she is approaching.
00:33:20.660,00:33:23.820,当其一旦迫近皇后与太后,00:33:21.760,00:33:24.920,"Once she draws near Their Majesties,"
00:33:24.160,00:33:28.030,只怕主月二位就要受到逼害了,00:33:25.260,00:33:29.297,the two masters of the Moon will be in danger.
00:33:29.750,00:33:32.840,宫外有身孕的女子,00:33:30.850,00:33:33.982,A pregnant woman outside the palace?
00:33:33.920,00:33:37.920,北方高峰凌云峰,00:33:35.020,00:33:37.046,High elevation in the north ...
,,,00:33:37.755,00:33:39.229,Peak Lingyun.
00:33:39.890,00:33:41.220,宫外北方,00:33:40.990,00:33:42.403,North... outside the palace.
00:33:43.980,00:33:47.840,苏培盛莞嫔回宫的事,00:33:45.080,00:33:46.535,Su Peisheng.
00:33:49.190,00:33:50.140,你先缓办吧,00:33:47.369,00:33:49.818,The return of Concubine Sourire
00:33:50.820,00:33:51.470,嘛,00:33:50.000,00:33:51.920,can take a lower priority for now.
,,,00:33:51.920,00:33:52.737,Yes.
00:33:55.820,00:33:58.730,娘娘苏培盛传来消息说,00:33:56.920,00:33:59.826,"Your Highness, Su Peisheng sent a message that"
00:33:59.570,00:34:01.690,皇上顾忌危月燕冲月的天象,00:33:59.826,00:34:04.202,"His Majesty is concerned about an astrological event:
the Roof mansion is impinging on the Moon,"
00:34:02.410,00:34:05.070,一时怕不能接娘娘回宫了,00:34:04.202,00:34:06.754,so your return will have to be postponed.
00:34:12.880,00:34:13.710,我早就知道,,,
00:34:15.050,00:34:16.210,回宫没有那么容易,00:34:13.980,00:34:15.680,I knew from the start
,,,00:34:15.748,00:34:18.400,that it wouldn't be so easy to return to the palace.
00:34:18.760,00:34:21.750,也好见招拆招,00:34:20.000,00:34:23.457,"That's fine. ""Attacks and counterattacks."""
00:34:22.430,00:34:24.340,总比不知道她们要做什么的好,00:34:23.457,00:34:26.126,It's better than not knowing what they're up to.
00:34:26.140,00:34:27.800,你叫苏培盛告诉眉姐姐,00:34:27.240,00:34:29.447,Tell Su Peisheng to inform Meizhuang
00:34:28.650,00:34:31.850,一切的事要她劝得动太后才好,00:34:29.750,00:34:33.033,"everything will be easier

00:34:32.770,00:34:34.610,好奴婢这就去,00:34:33.870,00:34:35.710,"Yes, I'll tell him now."
00:34:43.410,00:34:45.370,额娘前些日子扭伤受惊,00:34:44.510,00:34:46.867,"Mother, you sprained your ankle
and had a fright a few days ago."
00:34:46.200,00:34:47.790,还好如今已经大好了,00:34:47.300,00:34:49.204,I'm glad that you've recovered now.
00:34:48.540,00:34:50.780,只是还请额娘今后走动当心,00:34:49.640,00:34:51.985,Please be careful when you walk.
00:34:51.500,00:34:53.330,否则儿臣实在无法安心,00:34:52.600,00:34:54.660,I was worried about you.
00:34:55.010,00:34:56.920,幸好本宫没什么大碍,00:34:56.110,00:34:58.083,"Luckily, it was nothing serious."
00:34:57.550,00:34:59.710,休息这几天好多了,00:34:58.650,00:35:00.795,I’m feeling better after a few days' rest.
00:35:00.510,00:35:02.250,只是一直待在宫里边,,,
00:35:02.600,00:35:03.590,还是挺想你的,00:35:01.610,00:35:04.370,"But being in the palace the whole time,
I’ve missed you."
00:35:04.720,00:35:07.680,儿臣劳烦额娘操心 实在不敢当,00:35:05.820,00:35:08.760,"It is my undeserved honor
that you were concerned about me."
00:35:08.060,00:35:10.050,好啊今儿下学得早,00:35:09.160,00:35:11.410,"Since your school finished early today,"
00:35:10.310,00:35:12.100,可以陪额娘谈谈心了,00:35:11.410,00:35:13.503,we have some time for a chat.
00:35:12.900,00:35:15.730,怎么师傅教你的你有温习吗,00:35:14.000,00:35:17.019,Have you reviewed what your tutor taught you?
00:35:17.030,00:35:17.890,都温习了,00:35:18.130,00:35:19.260,"Yes, I have."
00:35:18.570,00:35:20.560,那就好只要你用心,00:35:19.260,00:35:21.640,"That’s good. As long as you put in the effort,"
00:35:20.780,00:35:22.740,你皇阿玛肯定会喜欢的,00:35:21.880,00:35:23.903,His Majesty will appreciate it.

00:35:43.050,00:35:45.040,是圆明园跟来的几个保姆嬷嬷,00:35:44.150,00:35:46.579,"The elderly maids that came with him
from the Summer Palace."
00:35:46.060,00:35:47.720,皇上有来看四阿哥吗,,,
00:35:48.480,00:35:49.890,除非皇上问及功课,00:35:47.160,00:35:49.175,Has His Majesty visited the Fourth Prince?
00:35:50.190,00:35:51.050,否则不曾提起,00:35:49.580,00:35:51.180,"Except for asking about his studies,"
,,,00:35:51.180,00:35:52.839,His Majesty has never mentioned him.
00:35:52.400,00:35:55.850,三阿哥四阿哥跟你一起读书,00:35:53.560,00:35:56.930,"Third Prince, you and the Fourth Prince study together,"
00:35:56.320,00:35:57.600,你觉得他成绩如何,00:35:57.420,00:35:59.245,how does he perform in class?
00:35:58.530,00:36:00.690,师傅总说四弟开蒙晚,00:35:59.630,00:36:02.090,"The tutor always says that although my brother started late,"
00:36:00.990,00:36:03.820,但天资聪颖 所以学得很快,00:36:02.090,00:36:04.900,he is intelligent and learns quickly.

00:36:06.910,00:36:09.570,皇阿玛很少和四弟说话,00:36:08.220,00:36:10.733,Father rarely speaks with him.
00:36:11.370,00:36:13.740,你和四阿哥比如何,00:36:12.470,00:36:14.987,How do you compare to the Fourth Prince?
00:36:14.170,00:36:16.700,四弟勤奋但是他开蒙晚,00:36:15.270,00:36:17.982,"Although he’s diligent, he started late,"
00:36:17.210,00:36:18.540,好多东西都没有学过,,,
00:36:19.090,00:36:21.460,所以比不上儿臣,00:36:18.202,00:36:20.834,"There's still a lot he must learn, so"
00:36:21.880,00:36:23.090,现在是比不上,00:36:21.507,00:36:23.143,he can't compare to me.

00:36:24.010,00:36:26.250,可他下学之后还这么苦读,00:36:25.110,00:36:27.330,"But he’s working so hard after class,"
00:36:26.810,00:36:28.390,可是比你要用心多了,00:36:27.910,00:36:30.000,and putting forth more effort than you do.
00:36:32.640,00:36:34.050,这么用心的孩子,00:36:33.740,00:36:35.505,He puts his heart into study

00:39:13.510,00:39:14.880,误食了四阿哥的绿豆汤,00:39:12.280,00:39:14.360,"Your Majesty, the Fourth Prince's maid"
00:39:15.640,00:39:17.130,当场毒发身亡,00:39:14.360,00:39:16.230,accidentally ate his mung bean soup

00:39:28.700,00:39:29.610,臣妾想过,00:39:29.800,00:39:30.873,I was thinking
00:39:29.950,00:39:32.780,四阿哥没有生母在宫中无人照拂,00:39:31.050,00:39:33.880,"the Fourth Prince doesn't have his mother
in the palace to look after him."

00:39:36.450,00:39:38.110,留四阿哥在寿康宫居住,00:39:36.220,00:39:37.550,I plead with Your Majesty
00:39:38.500,00:39:39.410,以保无虞,00:39:37.550,00:39:40.461,"to allow the Fourth Prince
to stay in the Palace of Longevity."
00:39:39.830,00:39:40.790,这是应当的,00:39:40.930,00:39:42.140,I'm obligated to.
00:39:42.460,00:39:43.240,好孩子,00:39:43.560,00:39:44.715,"Good grandson,"
00:39:43.790,00:39:45.700,让你瞧见了不干净的东西,00:39:44.890,00:39:46.800,what filth you have witnessed.
00:39:46.090,00:39:46.870,受惊了,00:39:47.190,00:39:48.220,You must be terrified.
00:39:48.670,00:39:50.460,至于谋害四阿哥嬷嬷的事,00:39:49.770,00:39:51.847,"Regarding the murder of the Fourth Prince's maid,"
00:39:50.930,00:39:52.460,是否还再追查下去,00:39:52.030,00:39:53.760,should it be further pursued?
00:39:54.350,00:39:55.460,只怕是难啊,,,
00:39:56.600,00:39:57.710,一碗绿豆汤,00:39:55.450,00:39:56.977,That might be too difficult I'm afraid.
00:39:58.020,00:40:00.100,多少人碰过多少人经手,00:39:57.700,00:39:59.144,A single bowl of mung bean soup
00:40:01.350,00:40:02.890,若查下去闹大了,00:39:59.144,00:40:01.577,could have been passed through many hands.
00:40:03.480,00:40:05.270,岂不成了宫中丑闻,00:40:02.450,00:40:04.282,"If the investigation escalates,"
00:40:07.070,00:40:08.150,太后说得是,00:40:04.580,00:40:06.370,this would be a scandal in the palace.
00:40:08.740,00:40:10.690,为了危月燕冲月的天象,00:40:08.170,00:40:09.840,I agree with Your Majesty.
00:40:10.950,00:40:12.360,影响太后跟皇后,00:40:09.840,00:40:13.792,"Your Majesty and the Empress have been affected by the
impingement of the Roof mansion on Moon."
00:40:13.070,00:40:15.730,莞嫔有了身孕也不能迎回宫中,00:40:14.170,00:40:16.830,Concubine Sourire cannot return to the palace
00:40:16.160,00:40:17.520,只能长留在外,00:40:17.093,00:40:19.079,and must stay outside with an imperial heir.
00:40:18.290,00:40:20.870,长此下去皇嗣受损,00:40:19.390,00:40:22.053,"If this goes on, the imperial lineage might be compromised."
00:40:21.460,00:40:25.700,真不知道是冲月还是冲了皇嗣啊,00:40:22.560,00:40:26.800,"Is it the Moon that is being impinged upon,
or the imperial heirs?"
00:40:27.920,00:40:28.580,芳若,00:40:29.020,00:40:30.000,"Orchid,"
00:40:29.380,00:40:32.000,你去把四阿哥的东西搬来寿康宫,00:40:30.480,00:40:33.100,Move the Fourth Prince's belongings to the Palace of Longevity.
00:40:32.380,00:40:34.000,这些日子就让四阿哥,,,
00:40:34.340,00:40:35.680,暂且待在哀家这儿,00:40:33.480,00:40:36.518,The Fourth Prince will stay here for now.
00:40:36.680,00:40:38.010,看谁敢害他,00:40:37.780,00:40:39.527,I dare anyone to harm him.
00:40:39.220,00:40:42.720,是那奴婢先带四阿哥下去休息,00:40:40.320,00:40:41.473,"Yes, Your Majesty."
,,,00:40:41.473,00:40:43.820,"I will take the Fourth Prince to his chamber to rest,"
00:40:43.060,00:40:44.850,再去收拾四阿哥的东西,00:40:44.160,00:40:46.033,and then collect his belongings.
00:40:48.020,00:40:48.980,孙儿告退,00:40:49.120,00:40:50.831,"Grandmother, I shall take my leave."
00:40:54.110,00:40:55.270,你也先退下吧,00:40:55.210,00:40:56.680,You may leave as well.
00:40:55.620,00:40:58.110,是臣妾告退,00:40:56.720,00:40:59.210,"Yes, I bid Your Majesty goodbye."
00:41:07.590,00:41:11.000,竹息你看这害四阿哥的事,00:41:08.690,00:41:09.774,"Bamboo,"
00:41:12.050,00:41:13.250,像是谁干的,00:41:10.441,00:41:12.494,who do you think made this attempt
00:41:13.800,00:41:15.460,太后心里明镜儿似的,00:41:13.078,00:41:14.769,to harm the Fourth Prince's life?
00:41:15.930,00:41:17.090,奴婢不敢胡说,00:41:14.900,00:41:16.643,Your Majesty's mind is a clear mirror.
00:41:17.510,00:41:19.130,怕扰了太后的心思,00:41:17.030,00:41:18.440,I dare not speak nonsense
00:41:19.850,00:41:21.180,宫里除了她,00:41:18.610,00:41:20.230,to disturb Your Majesty's judgement.
,,,00:41:20.950,00:41:22.697,"In the palace, aside from her,"
00:41:21.810,00:41:25.520,还有谁更在乎四阿哥的存在呢,00:41:22.910,00:41:26.620,who else would care about the Fourth Prince's presence?
00:41:25.980,00:41:28.220,好歹皇后有三阿哥这个儿子,00:41:27.080,00:41:29.570,"But the Empress has the Third Prince as her son,"
00:41:29.440,00:41:30.650,不至于吧,00:41:30.000,00:41:32.000,she shouldn't have a reason to do this.
00:41:30.900,00:41:33.110,正因为有了三阿哥这个义子,00:41:32.000,00:41:34.418,It's precisely because she has a foster son
00:41:33.860,00:41:36.650,才更要为三阿哥铺平太子之路,00:41:34.960,00:41:37.959,that she wants to clear his way to the Crown.
00:41:37.990,00:41:40.530,皇后真是越来越肆无忌惮了,00:41:39.090,00:41:41.797,The Empress is becoming more and more unscrupulous.
00:41:42.120,00:41:44.910,宫中竟连一个压制她的人都没有,00:41:43.220,00:41:46.093,No one in the harem can check her.
00:41:46.040,00:41:47.280,长此下去,00:41:47.140,00:41:48.672,"If it goes on like this,"
00:41:48.670,00:41:51.160,只怕皇帝要后嗣凋零了,00:41:49.770,00:41:52.260,I'm afraid that the imperial bloodline will wither.
00:41:54.630,00:41:58.630,竹息明日请皇上来一趟,00:41:55.730,00:41:56.820,"Bamboo,"
,,,00:41:57.863,00:42:00.000,ask the Emperor to come here tomorrow.
00:42:00.050,00:42:00.710,是,00:42:01.150,00:42:01.935,Yes.
00:42:03.220,00:42:04.430,四阿哥无恙,00:42:04.320,00:42:05.655,The Fourth Prince survived?
00:42:05.230,00:42:08.310,死的是伺候四阿哥的嬷嬷,00:42:06.330,00:42:09.410,It was the Fourth Prince's maid who died.
00:42:08.600,00:42:09.180,无能,00:42:09.700,00:42:10.530,Incompetent!
00:42:10.110,00:42:12.270,奴才该死 请皇后娘娘责罚,00:42:11.210,00:42:13.370,"My offense deserves death, Your Majesty.
Please punish me."
00:42:13.110,00:42:15.020,立即撒手 撒得干干净净,00:42:14.210,00:42:16.329,Withdraw immediately. Clear any traces.
00:42:15.490,00:42:17.850,大家没放下警惕前不许再动手,00:42:16.590,00:42:19.273,No further moves until everyone lets down their guard.
00:42:18.820,00:42:19.310,嗻,00:42:19.805,00:42:20.867,Yes.

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.100,00:43:00.100,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.100,00:43:20.100,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.100,00:43:37.100,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.100,00:43:55.100,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.100,00:44:03.100,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.100,00:44:15.100,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.100,00:44:34.100,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
