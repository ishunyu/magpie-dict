00:02:21.430,00:02:23.040,皇上驾到,00:02:22.440,00:02:24.240,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:02:26.520,00:02:27.550,皇上万福金安,,,
00:02:27.850,00:02:28.430,起来吧,00:02:27.440,00:02:28.560,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:02:28.730,00:02:29.430,谢皇上,00:02:28.840,00:02:29.720,Rise.
00:02:32.860,00:02:33.640,你母亲呢,00:02:29.720,00:02:31.380,I thank Your Majesty.
00:02:35.110,00:02:36.140,听说皇上要来,00:02:33.780,00:02:35.140,Where is your mother?
00:02:36.610,00:02:37.820,母亲先告辞回去了,00:02:36.260,00:02:38.820,"She heard that Your Majesty was coming
so she excused herself and left."
00:02:38.200,00:02:40.610,怎么朕这么怕人,00:02:39.280,00:02:41.700,"Why, am I so intimidating"
00:02:41.370,00:02:42.860,连丈母娘都吓跑了,00:02:42.300,00:02:44.520,that I've scared away my own mother-in-law?
00:02:44.410,00:02:46.820,母亲常说 外命妇不宜面圣,00:02:44.880,00:02:47.880,"Mother always says that it's inappropriate for wives
of court officials to meet with Your Majesty."
00:02:47.120,00:02:47.860,恐失了规矩,,,
00:02:48.460,00:02:50.290,父亲也常常提醒母亲,00:02:47.880,00:02:49.580,She fears any breaches of imperial protocol.
00:02:50.580,00:02:52.870,不宜在宫中久留 怕招惹闲话,00:02:49.580,00:02:51.420,Father also frequently advises her
,,,00:02:51.620,00:02:54.500,"not to stay for too long in the palace
or else people would start gossiping."
00:02:55.500,00:02:56.960,皇上这是刚从哪儿来啊,00:02:56.580,00:02:58.280,Where was Your Majesty before coming here?
00:02:59.010,00:03:00.870,刚从存菊堂过来,00:02:59.980,00:03:02.380,I came here from the Chamber of Chrysanthemums.
00:03:02.510,00:03:04.380,眉姐姐那儿的藕粉桂花糖糕,,,
00:03:04.720,00:03:06.880,做得最有滋味 皇上尝了吗,00:03:03.420,00:03:06.440,"Meizhuang makes the most delicious
lotus osmanthus cakes."
,,,00:03:06.920,00:03:08.500,Has Your Majesty tried some?
00:03:07.600,00:03:09.840,藕粉桂花糖糕的确是甜,00:03:08.720,00:03:11.080,Her lotus osmanthus cakes are sweet indeed.
00:03:10.560,00:03:12.020,可是那个人却不甜,00:03:11.620,00:03:13.480,But she herself is not so.
00:03:13.480,00:03:14.390,但凡朕去,00:03:14.460,00:03:16.080,"Whenever I visit her,"
00:03:15.570,00:03:19.930,三次里有两次推托着不与朕亲近,00:03:16.580,00:03:18.560,she almost always finds excuses
00:03:20.990,00:03:22.600,难道她还在为,00:03:18.960,00:03:20.940,not to be close to me.
00:03:22.910,00:03:25.440,昔年朕错怪她的事耿耿于怀吗,00:03:21.980,00:03:24.300,Does she still hold a grudge against me
,,,00:03:24.300,00:03:26.700,because of how I wronged her in the past?
00:03:27.160,00:03:29.150,皇上千万不要责怪眉姐姐,00:03:28.160,00:03:30.460,Your Majesty must not blame Meizhuang.
00:03:30.830,00:03:32.040,都是臣妾不好,,,
00:03:32.330,00:03:33.200,朕并没有责怪她,00:03:31.700,00:03:33.080,It's all my fault.
00:03:33.460,00:03:35.200,你怎么先倒认起不是来了,00:03:33.240,00:03:36.120,"I wasn't blaming her.
What are you apologizing for?"
00:03:36.590,00:03:39.000,眉姐姐怎会因昔日之事怨恨皇上,00:03:37.660,00:03:40.900,Meizhuang wouldn't have a grudge against Your Majesty about what happened in the past.
00:03:40.220,00:03:41.670,都怪臣妾从前多嘴,00:03:41.140,00:03:43.460,It's all because I misspoke when talking with her.
00:03:43.640,00:03:45.630,眉姐姐与臣妾自幼要好,00:03:44.460,00:03:46.780,Meizhuang and I have been good friends since childhood
00:03:46.010,00:03:46.920,又一同进宫,00:03:47.020,00:03:48.620,and we entered the palace at the same time.
00:03:47.680,00:03:49.800,希望能长久陪伴在皇上身边,00:03:48.620,00:03:50.740,We hope to accompany Your Majesty for eternity.
00:03:51.270,00:03:54.180,眉姐姐素日为皇上身体考虑,00:03:52.180,00:03:55.420,"Meizhuang is always thinking about
Your Majesty's well-being."
00:03:54.940,00:03:56.020,若是宠妃多了,00:03:55.860,00:03:57.580,"If there are too many concubines in favor,"
00:03:56.610,00:03:58.810,多少总会对龙体有损,00:03:57.580,00:04:00.020,it would surely affect Your Majesty's health.
00:04:00.070,00:04:02.150,所以私下与臣妾说起此事,,,
00:04:02.490,00:04:03.440,亦有几分担心,00:04:00.980,00:04:04.500,"Meizhuang expressed her worry to me
when we talked about this in the past."
00:04:04.360,00:04:05.820,而皇上一向,,,
00:04:06.070,00:04:08.030,心疼臣妾与安妹妹多一些,00:04:05.300,00:04:09.040,"Your Majesty has always cared for
me and Lingrong more than her."
00:04:09.330,00:04:12.790,所以眉姐姐决定效仿古代贤妃,00:04:10.180,00:04:14.080,"So Meizhuang decided to live in the mold
of the virtuous concubines of old."
00:04:13.960,00:04:17.120,照拂皇上身体 而不争皇上雨露,00:04:14.940,00:04:16.660,Caring for Your Majesty's health
00:04:17.880,00:04:18.910,故有如此举动,00:04:16.820,00:04:18.620,instead of striving for Your Majesty's favor.
,,,00:04:18.800,00:04:20.780,That's why Meizhuang has been keeping her distance.
00:04:21.260,00:04:22.340,如此说来,00:04:22.140,00:04:23.520,It turns out that
00:04:22.840,00:04:25.130,惠贵人对朕颇为关心哪,00:04:23.720,00:04:26.260,Lady Vertu actually cares very deeply about me.
00:04:27.050,00:04:30.140,此事上臣妾不如眉姐姐,00:04:28.040,00:04:31.200,"In that regard, I'm not as considerate as Meizhuang."
00:04:30.430,00:04:31.140,怎么说,00:04:31.440,00:04:32.720,Why is that?
00:04:32.980,00:04:34.470,臣妾做不了贤妃,00:04:33.880,00:04:35.960,I cannot be a virtuous concubine.
00:04:36.150,00:04:39.730,臣妾想多和皇上在一起,00:04:37.240,00:04:38.180,I ...
,,,00:04:39.120,00:04:41.760,want to spend more time with Your Majesty.
00:04:42.990,00:04:44.230,贤妃虽好,00:04:44.000,00:04:46.200,Virtuous concubines are indeed nice to have.
00:04:45.450,00:04:48.810,却也失了闺阁情趣了 不如你,00:04:46.380,00:04:48.120,"But they lack feminine charms,"
,,,00:04:48.941,00:04:50.222,unlike you.
00:04:50.830,00:04:53.190,娘娘得偿夙愿 终于可以安心了,00:04:51.860,00:04:55.080,"Your Highness can finally rest easy
after realizing your long-cherished wish."
00:04:54.960,00:04:56.700,也不枉费我费尽心思,00:04:55.620,00:04:57.860,All the painstaking effort I've made is worth it.
00:04:57.210,00:04:59.170,终于给温宜挣了个好前程,00:04:58.180,00:05:00.240,I've finally secured a bright future for Wenyi.
00:04:59.540,00:05:00.530,奴婢贺喜娘娘,00:05:00.460,00:05:02.200,"Congratulations, Your Highness."
00:05:04.760,00:05:08.090,先别忙着道喜这还只是个嫔位,00:05:05.680,00:05:07.680,Don't congratulate me yet.
,,,00:05:07.980,00:05:09.600,I'm only a Concubine for now.
00:05:09.300,00:05:13.640,妃 贵妃 我要一步一步爬上去,00:05:10.420,00:05:12.160,"Consort, Noble Consort ..."
,,,00:05:13.000,00:05:15.080,I'm going to crawl my way up.
00:05:14.480,00:05:17.340,我爬得越高 温宜的前程就越好,00:05:15.480,00:05:18.520,"The higher I stand, the brighter
Wenyi's prospects will be."
00:05:18.060,00:05:21.270,将来就越能指婚得一个好额附,00:05:18.940,00:05:22.120,"And the more likely she will be
arranged into a good marriage."
00:05:21.610,00:05:22.470,娘娘多虑了,00:05:22.440,00:05:23.820,Your Highness might be overthinking.
00:05:22.900,00:05:25.770,其实公主只要得到皇上疼爱,00:05:23.900,00:05:26.660,"Actually, as long as His Majesty adores the princess,"
00:05:26.070,00:05:27.030,比什么都要紧,,,
00:05:27.740,00:05:28.950,你哪里懂这些,00:05:26.840,00:05:28.620,there is nothing to worry about.
00:05:30.370,00:05:31.820,皇上正当盛年,00:05:28.800,00:05:30.400,How would you know?
00:05:32.620,00:05:34.610,将来皇子会越来越多,00:05:31.260,00:05:33.020,His Majesty is in his prime.
00:05:35.330,00:05:36.910,公主本就不受重视,00:05:33.920,00:05:35.980,He is bound to have more princes in the future.
00:05:37.330,00:05:39.070,若是皇后嫡出的固伦公主,00:05:36.220,00:05:38.180,"Princesses are not highly-regarded, to begin with."
00:05:39.380,00:05:40.160,倒也罢了,00:05:38.340,00:05:41.160,"Unless they are a State Princess, born to the Empress."
00:05:40.750,00:05:42.740,偏还只是个小小贵人的公主,00:05:41.640,00:05:44.060,But Wenyi is merely the daughter of a Concubine.
00:05:43.550,00:05:46.540,一个不小心便只能走上,00:05:44.600,00:05:46.780,"One wrong move, and Wenyi would be"
00:05:46.880,00:05:49.370,和朝瑰公主般和亲之路了,00:05:46.840,00:05:50.280,arranged into a marriage alliance like Princess Zhaogui.
00:05:50.100,00:05:52.800,娘娘为了公主真是用心良苦,00:05:50.760,00:05:53.680,Your Highness has really exerted yourself for the princess.
00:05:55.350,00:05:56.930,我只有温宜一个女儿,00:05:56.140,00:05:58.100,"Wenyi is my only child,"
00:05:57.770,00:06:00.850,温宜也只有我一个额娘,00:05:58.680,00:06:01.780,and I am her only mother.
00:06:01.820,00:06:02.980,这偌大的皇宫,00:06:02.540,00:06:04.500,"In this vast palace,"
00:06:04.070,00:06:06.520,就我们母女两人相依为命,00:06:05.000,00:06:07.680,Wenyi and I can depend only on each other.
00:06:06.990,00:06:08.320,娘娘千万别这么说,00:06:07.900,00:06:09.540,Your Highness must not say that.
00:06:08.780,00:06:10.440,好歹还有莞嫔娘娘,00:06:09.940,00:06:12.200,There's also Her Highness Concubine Sourire.
00:06:12.780,00:06:16.240,华妃不可靠 莞嫔更不可靠,00:06:13.680,00:06:17.020,"Consort Fleur is not reliable,
but Concubine Sourire is even worse."
00:06:17.210,00:06:19.570,利聚而来 利尽而散,00:06:18.080,00:06:21.760,"People come together when there's something to gain,
and go their separate ways when there's nothing left."
00:06:20.920,00:06:23.700,他日莞嫔若要阻我封妃之路,00:06:22.120,00:06:24.860,"If Concubine Sourire hinders my way to
becoming a Consort in the future,"
00:06:24.710,00:06:26.330,我照样不会手软,00:06:25.820,00:06:27.740,I will show no mercy.
00:06:27.300,00:06:30.540,听说皇帝已经赐年羹尧自尽,00:06:28.300,00:06:31.620,I heard that you've already granted Nian Gengyao suicide.
00:06:31.600,00:06:35.050,是 年羹尧不敢不死,00:06:32.460,00:06:33.540,Yes.
,,,00:06:34.360,00:06:36.660,Nian Gengyao would not dare to defy my order.
00:06:36.680,00:06:38.670,年羹尧的事一解决,00:06:37.600,00:06:40.100,"Now that Nian Gengyao has been taken care of,"
00:06:39.230,00:06:42.260,皇帝也算是少了一桩心事了,00:06:40.320,00:06:43.240,you have one fewer problem on your mind.
00:06:43.230,00:06:44.720,只是年答应她,00:06:44.000,00:06:46.060,As for Companion Nian ...
00:06:45.780,00:06:48.230,皇帝打算如何处置,00:06:46.680,00:06:49.480,What do you plan to do about her?
00:06:49.400,00:06:53.520,儿子与世兰到底是多年的夫妻,00:06:50.360,00:06:52.340,"After all, Shilan and I"
00:06:53.870,00:06:54.820,总有恩情在,00:06:53.160,00:06:56.200,"have been husband and wife for years
and we share gratitude and devotion."
00:06:55.870,00:06:58.450,许多事也是儿子对不住她,00:06:56.800,00:07:00.060,I feel guilty towards her for many things that happened.
00:06:59.870,00:07:01.240,只要她不再生事,00:07:00.840,00:07:02.960,"As long as she creates no more trouble,"
00:07:02.460,00:07:06.250,儿子日后会给她个贵人的位分,00:07:03.560,00:07:07.200,I will promote her to Noble Lady in the future
00:07:06.840,00:07:08.580,让她好好养在宫里,00:07:07.720,00:07:10.040,so that she can live peacefully in the palace.
00:07:09.550,00:07:10.910,皇帝是重情,00:07:10.600,00:07:12.760,You cherish the affection between you two.
00:07:12.260,00:07:15.130,只是年答应性子刚烈如火,00:07:13.160,00:07:16.180,But Companion Nian has a fiery temper.
00:07:16.060,00:07:17.220,只怕是难哪,00:07:16.880,00:07:18.880,I doubt she'll be able to avoid trouble.
00:07:19.020,00:07:22.980,皇额娘过些时候,00:07:19.940,00:07:21.620,"Imperial Mother,"
00:07:23.230,00:07:25.470,就是曹贵人封嫔的好日子了,00:07:23.240,00:07:26.860,Lady Cao's Concubinary Ceremony is coming up soon.
00:07:26.480,00:07:28.970,儿子让她把温宜带来给您请安,00:07:27.500,00:07:30.360,"I will ask her to bring Wenyi here
to pay their respects."
00:07:30.110,00:07:33.600,也好哀家很久没有看见温宜了,00:07:31.100,00:07:34.540,Good. I haven't seen Wenyi for some time.
00:07:35.490,00:07:38.980,皇帝嘉赏曹贵人 这件事做得好,00:07:36.480,00:07:39.840,I appreciate your rewarding of Lady Cao.
00:07:40.460,00:07:43.290,儿子不是不知道曹贵人背叛旧主,00:07:41.320,00:07:44.520,I'm not blind to Lady Cao's betrayal of her former master.
00:07:44.380,00:07:48.370,只是这时候需要她去做这些事,00:07:45.220,00:07:49.220,It's just that the situation required her to do so.
00:07:49.590,00:07:53.250,唯有她 在后宫揭发年答应,00:07:50.580,00:07:53.980,"Only with her revelation of
Companion Nian's crimes in the harem"
00:07:53.640,00:07:56.090,才能让众人心服口服,00:07:54.740,00:07:57.320,could I convince people's hearts and quiet their mouths.
00:07:57.180,00:07:58.920,皇帝的主意很好,00:07:58.220,00:08:00.020,Your plan was wise indeed.
00:08:00.100,00:08:01.510,不过像这样的人,00:08:00.680,00:08:02.600,"But for someone like her,"
00:08:02.190,00:08:03.930,给她位分是应该的,00:08:03.080,00:08:04.980,"while it is appropriate to promote her status,"
00:08:04.400,00:08:06.680,恩宠还是少些吧,00:08:05.200,00:08:07.820,she does not deserve your favor.
00:08:07.520,00:08:10.690,谁知她睡在枕边 脑中想些什么,00:08:08.480,00:08:11.780,"Who knows what she's thinking
when she shares your pillow at night?"
00:08:13.110,00:08:16.730,同样是聪慧 莞嫔便好多了,00:08:14.000,00:08:15.960,"Equally blessed with intelligence,"
,,,00:08:16.020,00:08:18.600,yet Concubine Sourire is superior to her.
00:08:18.910,00:08:21.370,太过聪慧都不是好事,00:08:19.920,00:08:22.400,Being too smart is not a good thing.
00:08:23.000,00:08:24.660,年羹尧的事了结了,00:08:24.000,00:08:25.880,"Now that Nian Gengyao has been settled,"
00:08:25.170,00:08:27.750,皇帝也不必再将朝廷中事,00:08:26.180,00:08:28.840,you don't need to discuss state affairs
00:08:28.210,00:08:29.330,说给莞嫔听了,00:08:29.040,00:08:30.800,with Concubine Sourire.
00:08:30.300,00:08:31.710,莞嫔虽然得体,00:08:31.240,00:08:33.120,"Although Concubine Sourire behaves with propriety,"
00:08:32.260,00:08:34.210,但是朝政的事听多了,00:08:33.200,00:08:35.480,"if she hears too much about the state affairs,"
00:08:34.800,00:08:36.170,难免会心眼大,00:08:35.580,00:08:37.680,it might grow selfish desires in her.
00:08:37.470,00:08:39.300,到时候就不好收拾了,00:08:38.440,00:08:40.640,Then it would be difficult to rectify the situation.
00:08:39.720,00:08:40.760,儿子自有分寸,00:08:40.680,00:08:42.680,I will act within the bounds of propriety.
00:08:43.060,00:08:44.890,年羹尧虽然清除了,00:08:44.080,00:08:46.220,"Even though Nian Gengyao has been eliminated,"
00:08:45.770,00:08:47.980,但朝中像他这样,00:08:46.700,00:08:48.980,"there are still other officials who are just like him,"
00:08:48.310,00:08:50.020,妄执恩宠的人还有,00:08:49.060,00:08:51.280,exploiting my favor and wielding arbitrary power.
00:08:51.230,00:08:54.820,得一个一个清理干净才好,00:08:52.220,00:08:55.820,They must be eliminated one by one.
00:08:58.870,00:09:00.480,年羹尧与隆科多,00:08:59.840,00:09:01.800,Nian Gengyao and Longkodo
00:09:01.120,00:09:03.080,辅佐皇帝登基有功,00:09:02.100,00:09:04.180,aided your accession to the throne.
00:09:04.330,00:09:08.450,年羹尧跋启 隆科多却已年老,00:09:05.220,00:09:07.380,Nian Gengyao was domineering
,,,00:09:07.640,00:09:09.640,but Longkodo is growing old.
00:09:09.590,00:09:12.580,皇帝可以让他回去颐养天年,00:09:10.560,00:09:14.360,"You could consider allowing him to retire
and spend his remaining years peacefully."
00:09:14.920,00:09:17.170,皇额娘替隆科多着想,00:09:15.960,00:09:18.580,"Imperial Mother, you have Longkodo's interests in mind,"
00:09:17.760,00:09:18.970,他自己却未必,00:09:18.620,00:09:20.440,but he himself doesn't.
00:09:21.100,00:09:22.590,过些时日再说吧,00:09:22.200,00:09:24.340,I will revisit this in the future.
00:09:25.310,00:09:28.470,何况儿子又没提隆科多舅舅,00:09:26.380,00:09:29.700,"Besides, I didn't mention Uncle Longkodo."
00:09:30.070,00:09:32.520,皇额娘怎么先想到他了呢,00:09:31.100,00:09:33.980,"Imperial Mother, why did you think of him?"
00:09:34.570,00:09:36.530,哀家不过是随口一说,00:09:35.640,00:09:38.240,It just came to mind incidentally.
00:09:41.200,00:09:43.530,时候不早了 儿子先告退,00:09:42.200,00:09:45.180,It's getting late. I shall take my leave.
00:09:44.540,00:09:47.450,好 出去路上小心,00:09:45.860,00:09:46.920,All right.
00:09:48.630,00:09:49.360,是,00:09:47.200,00:09:49.380,Be careful on your way back.
,,,00:09:49.720,00:09:50.900,Yes.
00:09:55.840,00:09:57.380,皇上起驾,00:09:56.860,00:09:59.000,His Majesty departs.
00:10:02.600,00:10:03.180,竹息,,,
00:10:04.060,00:10:04.800,是,00:10:03.500,00:10:04.640,Bamboo.
00:10:05.850,00:10:07.310,你看皇帝的意思,00:10:05.020,00:10:05.960,Yes.
,,,00:10:06.780,00:10:08.920,Do you think the Emperor ...
00:10:09.400,00:10:11.180,是不是年羹尧之后,00:10:10.320,00:10:12.580,Is he also going to remove Longkodo
00:10:12.190,00:10:13.850,皇帝便要除掉隆科多,00:10:13.120,00:10:15.040,after Nian Gengyao?
00:10:15.900,00:10:18.140,皇上不是忘恩负义之人,00:10:16.980,00:10:19.600,His Majesty is not someone who forgets a favor.
00:10:19.450,00:10:23.490,是吗 可是年羹尧之事,00:10:20.380,00:10:21.620,Really?
,,,00:10:22.740,00:10:25.440,But many people have been chattering behind closed doors
00:10:24.910,00:10:26.780,多少人在背后议论,00:10:25.760,00:10:28.280,"about his punishment of Nian Gengyao,"
00:10:27.870,00:10:31.830,皇帝刻薄寡恩 忘恩负义,00:10:29.040,00:10:32.780,"saying that the Emperor is ruthless and
unfaithful in his gratitude."
00:10:32.840,00:10:34.620,年羹尧多行不义,00:10:33.760,00:10:35.940,Nian Gengyao was doomed by his misconduct.
00:10:35.460,00:10:37.170,隆科多大人不会,00:10:36.480,00:10:38.520,But General Longkodo is not like him.
00:10:38.090,00:10:40.080,可是哀家耳朵里听到的,00:10:38.860,00:10:41.240,But I have often heard
00:10:41.260,00:10:43.720,隆科多保荐官员,00:10:42.280,00:10:45.240,"that General Longkodo has promoted
officials using his influence,"
00:10:44.760,00:10:48.800,自行结党的事也不少,00:10:45.760,00:10:48.774,"and has also formed a faction,"
,,,00:10:48.774,00:10:50.134,of his own.
00:10:49.890,00:10:53.100,太后 前朝的事您少操心,00:10:50.800,00:10:53.880,Your Majesty need not worry so much about state affairs.
00:10:54.020,00:10:56.610,养好自己的病才是最重要的,00:10:55.200,00:10:58.200,Restoring your health is of utmost importance.
00:11:12.880,00:11:13.580,曹姐姐,00:11:13.380,00:11:14.900,Cao.
00:11:17.380,00:11:20.120,莞妹妹的精神是越发好了,00:11:18.480,00:11:21.220,"Sourire, you look to be in good spirits."
00:11:20.840,00:11:23.380,哪能不好 曹姐姐的好日子,00:11:21.940,00:11:24.640,"How couldn't I be?
It is a wonderful day for you today."
00:11:24.800,00:11:26.260,上午祺贵人又入宫,,,
00:11:26.470,00:11:28.510,就住在储秀宫这可热闹了,00:11:25.700,00:11:28.560,"And Noble Lady Délice has moved into the
Palace of Gathering Excellence this morning."
00:11:29.350,00:11:30.890,储秀宫富丽堂皇,00:11:28.600,00:11:30.100,Won't that be lively?
00:11:31.310,00:11:32.970,可见皇上对这位祺贵人,00:11:30.240,00:11:32.140,"The Palace of Gathering Excellence
is luxuriously decorated."
00:11:33.270,00:11:34.230,有多重视呢,00:11:32.600,00:11:35.600,"We can see the importance of
Lady Délice in His Majesty's eyes."
00:11:35.400,00:11:37.180,祺贵人的阿玛 瓜尔佳鄂敏,00:11:36.380,00:11:38.440,"Gūwalgiya Emin, Lady Délice's father,
made outstanding contributions"
00:11:37.400,00:11:39.480,是平定敦亲王和年羹尧时的功臣,00:11:38.460,00:11:40.720,"to the pacification of
State Prince Dun and Nian Gengyao."
00:11:40.280,00:11:41.890,皇上自然对她青眼有加,00:11:41.140,00:11:43.440,It's no wonder that His Majesty views her favorably.
00:11:42.610,00:11:43.400,是啊,00:11:43.620,00:11:44.800,Indeed.
00:11:56.170,00:11:57.910,没事吧 快起来,00:11:56.160,00:11:59.140,Are you all right? Try to stand up.
00:11:59.460,00:11:59.920,起来,00:11:59.360,00:12:00.380,Stand up.
00:12:00.090,00:12:00.790,怎么了,00:12:00.760,00:12:02.580,What's going on?
00:12:04.430,00:12:05.920,怎么了 怎么了,00:12:05.420,00:12:07.480,What's the matter? What happened?
00:12:07.510,00:12:08.800,端妃娘娘万福金安,,,
00:12:09.140,00:12:10.000,娘娘万福金安,00:12:08.500,00:12:10.840,"- Peace and grace to Your Highness.
- Peace to Your Highness."
00:12:10.270,00:12:10.970,罢了,00:12:11.140,00:12:12.400,You may all rise.
00:12:12.190,00:12:14.350,怎么回事一群饭桶,00:12:13.100,00:12:15.380,What happened? You're all useless.
00:12:14.690,00:12:16.220,怎么连公主都看不好呢,,,
00:12:16.650,00:12:17.980,天天知道偷懒懈怠的,00:12:15.440,00:12:17.660,"How could the princess fall over
while under your care?"
00:12:18.320,00:12:19.180,明日本宫非回了皇后,00:12:17.860,00:12:19.540,What careless and lazy servants!
00:12:19.570,00:12:20.650,狠狠打你们一顿不可,00:12:19.600,00:12:22.100,"Tomorrow I will ask Her Majesty to
give you all a good flogging."
00:12:21.240,00:12:23.100,还不快看看 公主有无受伤,00:12:22.240,00:12:24.500,Check whether the princess has been injured.
00:12:28.830,00:12:30.190,多谢端妃娘娘相助,,,
00:12:30.580,00:12:31.440,不必客气,00:12:29.800,00:12:31.620,I am grateful for Your Highness's help.
,,,00:12:31.620,00:12:33.040,It was nothing.
00:12:32.960,00:12:34.160,端妃娘娘没事吧,00:12:33.980,00:12:35.460,Is Your Highness all right?
00:12:35.080,00:12:38.250,没事公主只是滑了一跤,00:12:36.040,00:12:37.260,I'm fine.
00:12:38.590,00:12:40.620,本宫抱得快应该没事,00:12:37.740,00:12:39.280,The princess just fell over.
00:12:41.380,00:12:43.620,不过还是请太医过来看一看,00:12:39.520,00:12:41.880,"I was quick to catch her.
I don't think she was injured."
00:12:43.930,00:12:44.880,比较稳妥些,00:12:42.380,00:12:45.740,"But it would be prudent to send for
the imperial doctors."
00:12:45.470,00:12:46.300,娘娘说得对,,,
00:12:46.720,00:12:47.750,音袖 还不请太医,00:12:46.160,00:12:47.540,I agree with Your Highness.
00:12:48.050,00:12:48.630,是,00:12:47.580,00:12:49.160,"Dulcet, call for the doctors."
00:12:49.010,00:12:49.750,你们也起来吧,00:12:49.160,00:12:50.060,Yes.
00:12:50.010,00:12:50.970,是,00:12:50.080,00:12:51.200,You all may rise.
,,,00:12:51.200,00:12:52.120,Yes.
00:12:55.650,00:12:56.810,小温宜,00:12:56.600,00:12:57.940,Little Wenyi.
00:13:00.020,00:13:01.260,这孩子倒不认生,00:13:00.820,00:13:02.320,She is not shy with Your Highness.
00:13:01.650,00:13:03.020,看了娘娘很亲切呢,00:13:02.380,00:13:04.260,She's very happy to see Your Highness.
00:13:03.860,00:13:04.770,真好,00:13:04.820,00:13:06.120,Good girl.
00:13:05.320,00:13:07.440,温宜公主很喜欢端妃娘娘呢,00:13:06.240,00:13:08.440,Princess Wenyi likes Your Highness so much.
00:13:08.780,00:13:09.610,真好,00:13:09.460,00:13:10.700,So lovely.
00:13:10.120,00:13:12.150,娘娘怎么一个人吉祥呢,00:13:11.160,00:13:13.600,Why is Your Highness alone? Where is Auspice?
00:13:13.750,00:13:16.450,本宫命她去取一些竹叶上的雪水,00:13:14.780,00:13:17.420,"I told her to collect some snow
from on top of the bamboo leaves."
00:13:16.830,00:13:17.910,我就在这里等她,,,
00:13:18.540,00:13:19.700,娘娘衣裳跌脏了,00:13:17.600,00:13:19.260,I was waiting here for her.
00:13:20.340,00:13:21.290,若不嫌弃的话,00:13:19.300,00:13:20.860,Your Highness's clothes are soiled.
00:13:21.800,00:13:23.750,请移驾碎玉轩换件衣裳吧,00:13:21.280,00:13:22.800,"If Your Highness doesn't mind,"
,,,00:13:22.800,00:13:25.360,you can get changed in the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:13:27.430,00:13:28.130,也好,00:13:28.120,00:13:29.500,All right.
00:13:29.930,00:13:31.790,浣碧 扶娘娘先去,00:13:30.780,00:13:32.800,"Jade, go with Her Highness."
00:13:32.430,00:13:33.090,是,00:13:33.240,00:13:34.220,Yes.
00:13:34.230,00:13:36.260,娘娘先行一步 我随后就到,00:13:35.160,00:13:38.000,I shall join Your Highness shortly.
00:13:52.080,00:13:55.440,可惜我家道中落 虽然跻身嫔位,00:13:53.160,00:13:55.140,It's a pity that my family has declined.
00:13:56.500,00:13:57.740,也难保能为温宜,00:13:55.300,00:13:57.080,"Although I am a concubine now,"
00:13:58.080,00:13:59.120,挣得一个好的前程,00:13:57.600,00:14:00.540,I can't guarantee a good future for Wenyi.
00:14:00.210,00:14:03.120,倘若能像端妃娘娘这样身为妃子,00:14:00.760,00:14:04.400,"If I could become a Consort
like Her Highness Consort Honnête,"
00:14:03.920,00:14:04.910,那就不同了,00:14:04.760,00:14:06.320,then things would be different.
00:14:07.340,00:14:08.630,我只是顺便说说,00:14:07.540,00:14:09.520,I was just saying that.
00:14:09.090,00:14:10.630,莞妹妹千万别往心里去啊,00:14:09.600,00:14:12.100,"Sourire, don't take my words seriously.
[There is only one vacancy for Consort now]"
00:14:11.140,00:14:14.380,哪里姐姐有这样的心是好事,00:14:12.300,00:14:13.420,I haven't.
00:14:15.180,00:14:16.300,不为自身计,00:14:13.780,00:14:15.440,I appreciate your ambition.
00:14:16.640,00:14:18.050,也要为公主将来打算,00:14:16.200,00:14:19.420,You have to plan for Wenyi's future if not for yourself.
00:14:19.690,00:14:20.800,我是公主的义母,00:14:20.640,00:14:22.420,I'm the honorary mother of the princess.
00:14:21.480,00:14:23.770,自然希望来日公主嫁得贵婿,00:14:22.500,00:14:24.520,I certainly hope that she can marry a good man
00:14:24.070,00:14:24.980,我也好沾光啊,00:14:24.680,00:14:26.560,which will also be an honor to me.
00:14:25.860,00:14:27.400,那就承蒙娘娘吉言了,00:14:26.920,00:14:29.040,I thank Your Highness for your good wishes.
00:14:29.410,00:14:31.900,我哪里比得妹妹受皇恩眷顾,00:14:30.300,00:14:32.720,I can't compare with you in His Majesty's favor.
00:14:32.200,00:14:34.440,父亲又刚为朝廷立下了汗马功劳,00:14:33.000,00:14:35.240,"Your father has just made
great contributions to the court"
00:14:34.740,00:14:35.780,甚得皇上的信任,00:14:35.420,00:14:37.500,and gained so much trust from His Majesty.
00:14:36.790,00:14:40.330,看来妹妹封妃是指日可待了,00:14:37.920,00:14:41.700,"Your promotion to the rank of Consort
is sure to happen in countable days."
00:14:41.040,00:14:44.080,温宜来日就全靠莞妹妹垂怜了,00:14:42.000,00:14:45.200,"Wenyi's future may all depend on you, Sourire."
00:14:46.090,00:14:47.880,襄者助也,00:14:47.000,00:14:49.300,"""Aide"" means assistance."
00:14:49.340,00:14:51.500,皇上为姐姐选此字做封号,00:14:50.500,00:14:52.820,"His Majesty's choice of this character
for your honorary name"
00:14:52.010,00:14:53.050,颇有深意,00:14:52.960,00:14:54.520,has profound meaning.
00:14:54.680,00:14:56.470,当姐姐的在文字上不通,00:14:55.620,00:14:57.520,I know little about words.
00:14:56.970,00:14:58.760,倒要请妹妹解释给我听,00:14:57.760,00:15:00.040,May I trouble you to explain it to me?
00:14:59.310,00:15:01.520,姐姐封嫔是因为什么缘故,00:15:00.120,00:15:02.880,"What was the reason that you were
granted the rank of Concubine?"
00:15:02.980,00:15:06.100,是因为前朝平息了年羹尧之事,00:15:03.680,00:15:07.140,It was that Nian Gengyao had just been pacified by the court.
00:15:06.900,00:15:07.770,而后宫中,,,
00:15:08.360,00:15:10.570,华妃又需要有人出面将其扳倒,00:15:07.840,00:15:11.560,"But in the harem, someone had to
come forward to take down Consort Fleur."
00:15:11.070,00:15:12.440,姐姐正得其时啊,00:15:11.900,00:15:13.740,And that person was you.
00:15:13.570,00:15:15.610,所以皇上封姐姐为襄嫔,00:15:14.520,00:15:16.900,So His Majesty promoted you as Concubine Aide.
00:15:15.990,00:15:16.860,就是这个意思,00:15:16.940,00:15:18.580,That's why this name was chosen.
00:15:18.790,00:15:21.910,只可惜现在年世兰还是答应,00:15:19.800,00:15:22.840,"But unfortunately, Nian Shilan is still a Companion."
00:15:22.420,00:15:23.620,皇上碍于情面,00:15:23.380,00:15:25.860,"His Majesty was probably
hindered by his affection and dignity"
00:15:24.750,00:15:27.490,大概也不能太为难她了,00:15:25.860,00:15:28.600,to impose any further punishment on her.
00:15:29.550,00:15:31.380,端妃姐姐在妹妹宫中更衣,00:15:30.620,00:15:32.460,Consort Honnête is in your palace.
00:15:31.680,00:15:33.260,想必妹妹也要赶快回去,00:15:32.520,00:15:34.400,I believe you need to return soon.
00:15:34.010,00:15:35.670,我也要陪公主回宫了,00:15:34.880,00:15:37.280,I shall be leaving with the princess now as well.
00:15:47.360,00:15:49.640,娘娘今后可真是要小心才好啊,00:15:48.140,00:15:51.160,Your Highness must be more careful in the future.
00:15:51.200,00:15:52.030,谢谢你,00:15:52.100,00:15:53.800,Thank you.
00:15:56.080,00:15:56.810,娘娘,,,
00:15:57.200,00:15:57.990,回来了,00:15:56.980,00:15:58.060,Your Highness.
00:15:58.410,00:15:59.150,坐着,00:15:58.060,00:15:59.160,You're back.
,,,00:15:59.220,00:16:00.340,Please sit.
00:16:00.040,00:16:02.570,槿汐 抱着娘娘换下的脏衣服,00:16:00.880,00:16:03.360,"Jinxi, take Her Highness's clothes"
00:16:02.870,00:16:03.660,命人去洗了吧,,,
00:16:04.000,00:16:04.610,好,00:16:03.480,00:16:04.780,and have them washed.
,,,00:16:04.780,00:16:05.740,Yes.
00:16:06.340,00:16:09.790,外头冷吧 快坐下,00:16:07.120,00:16:09.000,It's cold outside.
,,,00:16:09.800,00:16:10.940,Come sit.
00:16:10.420,00:16:12.460,娘娘手没事吧 让我瞧瞧,00:16:11.220,00:16:13.800,"Your Highness, are your hands all right?
Let me have a look."
00:16:12.630,00:16:16.420,没事 一点事都没有,00:16:13.800,00:16:14.800,Yes.
00:16:17.680,00:16:19.090,娘娘向来不喜华妃,00:16:15.600,00:16:17.200,Not a finger hurt.
00:16:19.560,00:16:21.550,襄嫔是从前华妃的人,00:16:18.520,00:16:20.380,Your Highness has always disliked Consort Fleur.
00:16:22.600,00:16:23.930,娘娘怎么肯奋不顾身,00:16:20.380,00:16:22.860,Concubine Aide was her follower in the past.
00:16:24.230,00:16:25.180,去救她的孩子呢,00:16:23.460,00:16:26.700,"Why did Your Highness put yourself
in harm's way to save her child?"
00:16:26.520,00:16:27.760,幼子无辜,00:16:27.460,00:16:29.740,The child is innocent of her mother's actions.
00:16:29.110,00:16:30.640,娘娘是真疼爱那孩子,00:16:29.940,00:16:31.940,Your Highness adores that child so much.
00:16:35.620,00:16:37.860,我于这儿女份上无缘,00:16:36.560,00:16:38.880,I was not blessed to bear a child.
00:16:38.490,00:16:40.910,只能心疼心疼别人的孩子,00:16:39.240,00:16:41.660,So I can only care for the children of others.
00:16:41.870,00:16:44.950,不过那个孩子当真是可爱极了,00:16:42.740,00:16:45.940,But that child is truly so adorable.
00:16:46.710,00:16:48.570,是的确有她母亲的聪明相,00:16:47.640,00:16:50.000,She does seem as clever as her mother.
00:16:49.840,00:16:50.790,只盼将来,00:16:50.760,00:16:52.180,I only hope
00:16:51.420,00:16:53.460,别学得她母亲那样刁滑就好,00:16:52.360,00:16:54.740,that she will not learn the wiles of her mother.
00:16:54.050,00:16:56.920,耳濡目染只怕是不行的,00:16:54.860,00:16:57.880,That's difficult - she hears and sees them always.
00:16:58.260,00:16:59.920,若是能为她换一位母亲,00:16:59.100,00:17:01.100,"If only she could be raised by a different mother,"
00:17:00.260,00:17:01.550,好好教导便是了,00:17:01.380,00:17:03.240,she could be properly edified.
00:17:11.980,00:17:15.270,给皇后娘娘请安各宫姐姐请安,00:17:12.000,00:17:16.020,"Peace to Your Majesty.
Peace to all the sisters in the harem."
00:17:16.320,00:17:17.150,起来吧,,,
00:17:17.870,00:17:19.030,谢皇后娘娘,00:17:17.260,00:17:18.460,You may rise.
,,,00:17:18.580,00:17:20.140,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:21.120,00:17:22.400,果然生得很美,00:17:20.360,00:17:21.800,(Noble Lady Délice)
,,,00:17:22.000,00:17:23.580,You are beautiful indeed.
00:17:23.000,00:17:25.200,上前来给本宫看看,00:17:23.900,00:17:26.100,Come closer. Let me see you.
00:17:25.670,00:17:26.400,是,00:17:26.460,00:17:27.880,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:17:30.960,00:17:34.380,这人长得不错 封号也很喜气,00:17:31.700,00:17:35.320,A pretty face and an auspicious name.
00:17:35.220,00:17:37.880,宫里新近的喜事真是不少,00:17:36.100,00:17:38.940,There has been so much joyful news in the harem recently.
00:17:38.590,00:17:40.210,这祺贵人是美,,,
00:17:41.060,00:17:42.800,但是眼角眉梢中啊,00:17:39.580,00:17:41.740,"Noble Lady Délice is beautiful,"
00:17:43.430,00:17:45.170,透露出算计的样子,00:17:42.080,00:17:45.780,but I can tell she's calculating from her eyes.
00:17:45.770,00:17:48.350,宫里人多心计也就多了,00:17:46.640,00:17:49.460,"The more women there are in the harem,
the more calculating they become,"
00:17:48.730,00:17:51.190,这是非就更多了,00:17:49.460,00:17:52.100,and the more quarrels and conflicts there are as well.
00:17:51.610,00:17:54.640,可这宫里的人永远只会多不会少,00:17:52.460,00:17:55.700,Yet women will always be found aplenty in the palace.
00:17:55.490,00:17:56.650,你们猜,00:17:56.220,00:17:57.640,Take a guess.
00:17:57.280,00:18:01.520,今天晚上皇上会不会召她侍寝啊,00:17:57.900,00:18:02.360,Will His Majesty select her to serve him tonight?
00:18:01.910,00:18:03.070,这有什么难猜的,00:18:02.740,00:18:04.280,That's easy.
00:18:03.540,00:18:05.240,难不成还是你我呀,00:18:04.500,00:18:06.800,Did you think it was going to be you or me?
00:18:06.660,00:18:07.490,你呀,00:18:07.380,00:18:08.620,You tease!
00:18:12.380,00:18:14.660,她父亲是平定年羹尧的功臣,00:18:13.000,00:18:15.820,"Her father made great contributions to
suppressing Nian Gengyao's rebellion."
00:18:15.130,00:18:15.920,是啊,00:18:16.000,00:18:16.920,Indeed.
00:18:16.170,00:18:18.160,我看这祺贵人不是等闲之辈,00:18:16.980,00:18:18.920,She doesn't seem like the sort to be trifled with.
00:18:18.380,00:18:19.040,可不是嘛,,,
00:18:19.390,00:18:20.370,宫里又该热闹了,00:18:18.980,00:18:20.180,I quite agree.
00:18:20.970,00:18:21.760,莞嫔姐姐,00:18:20.180,00:18:21.740,Things are about to get exciting in the harem again.
,,,00:18:21.960,00:18:23.140,Sourire!
00:18:25.640,00:18:28.130,莞嫔姐姐万福 惠贵人万福,00:18:26.200,00:18:29.000,"Peace to Concubine Sourire.
Peace to Noble Lady Vertu."
00:18:28.890,00:18:29.800,祺贵人有礼,00:18:29.500,00:18:31.200,"A pleasure to meet you, Noble Lady Délice."
00:18:30.350,00:18:32.560,嫔妾进宫前 阿玛曾有关照,00:18:31.440,00:18:33.320,"Before I entered the palace,"
00:18:32.860,00:18:34.770,莞嫔姐姐的父亲与嫔妾阿玛,,,
00:18:35.110,00:18:35.940,曾同在都察院,00:18:33.500,00:18:37.100,"my father told me that he worked
with your father in the Censorate."
00:18:36.360,00:18:38.440,所以特来向姐姐请安,00:18:37.320,00:18:39.440,So I came to pay my respects.
00:18:39.950,00:18:42.190,我是听说妹妹的阿玛,,,
00:18:42.450,00:18:44.440,为平定年羹尧之事尽心尽力,00:18:41.120,00:18:45.220,"I heard that your father dedicated himself
to the pacification of Nian Gengyao."
00:18:44.700,00:18:45.780,皇上激赏不已呢,,,
00:18:46.450,00:18:47.570,莞嫔姐姐夸奖,00:18:45.560,00:18:47.340,His Majesty greatly appreciates his efforts.
,,,00:18:47.520,00:18:48.980,"I'm flattered, Concubine Sourire."
00:18:48.120,00:18:50.700,嫔妾初来乍到 凡事有不周到的,00:18:49.260,00:18:50.760,I'm new to the palace.
00:18:51.040,00:18:52.160,还指望姐姐指点,00:18:50.760,00:18:53.740,"I hope that Your Highness can enlighten me
if I breach ritual propriety."
00:18:52.920,00:18:54.250,都说是旧相识了,00:18:53.960,00:18:55.820,"Like you said, we are old acquaintances."
00:18:54.670,00:18:57.290,还嫔妾长嫔妾短的 岂不见外吗,00:18:55.820,00:18:58.540,Please don't address me so formally.
00:18:58.340,00:18:59.550,姐姐若不嫌弃,,,
00:18:59.840,00:19:01.380,妹妹可否去姐姐那里坐坐,00:18:59.080,00:19:02.240,"Sourire, may I visit your place
if it's not too much trouble?"
00:19:01.760,00:19:03.750,自然好只怕你不来呢,00:19:02.500,00:19:05.220,"It's my pleasure.
I was worried that you wouldn't want to come."
00:19:10.650,00:19:13.010,皇上敬事房的人来了,00:19:11.320,00:19:12.760,"Your Majesty,"

00:20:30.020,00:20:31.880,是啊 奴婢去瞧瞧,00:20:30.880,00:20:32.940,I'll go find out.
00:20:34.600,00:20:35.430,祺贵人,00:20:35.320,00:20:36.620,Lady Délice.
00:20:36.150,00:20:38.060,姐姐我来和你做伴了,00:20:36.920,00:20:39.320,"Sourire, I've come to join you here."
00:20:40.320,00:20:42.270,怎么妹妹搬来也不跟我说一声,,,
00:20:42.650,00:20:43.730,我好替妹妹安排啊,00:20:41.120,00:20:44.720,"Why didn't you let me know you were moving here?
I could have helped you arrange it."
00:20:44.240,00:20:45.070,我才到宫中,,,
00:20:45.490,00:20:46.980,见了姐姐便觉得亲切,00:20:45.160,00:20:48.060,"I'm new to the palace.
But I feel close to you already."
00:20:47.450,00:20:49.570,又看碎玉轩就姐姐一个人住着,00:20:48.460,00:20:50.540,You live alone in the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:20:49.830,00:20:50.530,难免冷清,00:20:50.660,00:20:51.960,It must be lonely.
00:20:51.120,00:20:53.330,所以妹妹特意求了皇上和皇后,00:20:52.140,00:20:54.260,So I asked His Majesty and Her Majesty
00:20:53.790,00:20:54.700,来和姐姐同住,,,
00:20:56.170,00:20:57.410,可是碎玉轩偏远,00:20:54.600,00:20:56.260,to allow me to live with you.
00:20:57.840,00:20:59.500,如何能和储秀宫相比呢,00:20:57.020,00:20:58.880,But the Palace of Pearl jade is out of the way.
00:21:00.000,00:21:01.670,姐姐别嫌弃我自作主张,00:20:59.000,00:21:01.000,It cannot compare to the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:21:02.260,00:21:03.870,妹妹在宫里无依无靠,00:21:01.060,00:21:03.180,Please don't mind my coming without consulting you.
00:21:04.470,00:21:05.800,储秀宫的几位姐妹,00:21:03.280,00:21:05.220,I have nobody to rely on in the palace.
00:21:06.090,00:21:07.050,也不是好相与的,00:21:05.500,00:21:07.960,There is no one I get on with at the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:21:07.550,00:21:08.670,妹妹只求安生,,,
00:21:09.180,00:21:10.890,所以想来和姐姐做伴,00:21:08.400,00:21:10.120,I just want a peaceful life in the palace.
00:21:12.560,00:21:14.050,碎玉轩虽然偏远,00:21:10.200,00:21:12.040,So I want to be your companion.
00:21:14.390,00:21:15.550,但最清静不过了,00:21:13.580,00:21:16.580,"Although the Palace of Pearl Jade
is isolated, it's calm and quiet."
00:21:15.940,00:21:16.890,妹妹喜欢就好,00:21:16.820,00:21:18.320,I'm glad that you like it.
00:21:17.980,00:21:20.440,只是这西偏殿,,,
00:21:20.730,00:21:22.220,是从前淳贵人的住处,00:21:18.900,00:21:23.340,The western chamber was once Lady Chun's residence.
00:21:23.400,00:21:24.980,妹妹不如搬去东偏殿吧,00:21:24.240,00:21:26.340,Perhaps you should move into the eastern chamber.
00:21:25.490,00:21:26.230,也宽敞些,,,
00:21:26.700,00:21:27.480,多谢姐姐,00:21:26.400,00:21:27.700,It's also more spacious.
,,,00:21:27.700,00:21:29.120,"Thank you, Sourire."
00:21:37.040,00:21:38.700,小主都收拾好了,00:21:37.640,00:21:39.640,"My Lady, everything is ready in your room."
00:21:39.000,00:21:39.660,下去吧,00:21:39.780,00:21:40.980,You may leave.
00:21:47.640,00:21:49.750,小是比储秀宫小了许多,00:21:48.380,00:21:50.860,"This chamber is much smaller than
mine in the Palace of Gathering Excellence."
00:21:50.510,00:21:51.840,但的确是个好地方,,,
00:21:52.180,00:21:54.170,小主喜欢 可是奴婢却觉得,00:21:51.600,00:21:53.080,But it's a good place indeed.
00:21:54.560,00:21:55.670,这地方又小又远,00:21:53.080,00:21:56.660,"My Lady, you may like this chamber,
but I think it's small and isolated."
00:21:56.020,00:21:57.010,到皇上的养心殿,,,
00:21:57.440,00:21:58.600,还要走上好一段路,00:21:56.920,00:21:59.720,"It's quite a walk from here
to the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:21:59.100,00:22:00.940,哪里比得储秀宫方便呀,00:21:59.940,00:22:02.300,It's not as convenient as the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:22:02.320,00:22:05.310,储秀宫是方便 可是人多眼杂,00:22:03.060,00:22:06.200,"It has a convenient location,
but ears grow in the walls with so many people."
00:22:06.360,00:22:08.070,这碎玉轩虽然远,,,
00:22:09.240,00:22:11.070,但只要皇上心里记挂着,00:22:07.480,00:22:09.900,"Although the Palace of Pearl Jade is a remote place,"
00:22:11.530,00:22:12.990,再远怕什么,00:22:10.160,00:22:14.080,"the distance doesn't matter as long as
His Majesty keeps it in mind."
00:22:13.410,00:22:14.900,奴婢是怕委屈了小主,00:22:14.360,00:22:16.600,"I was just worried that this
would be unjust to you, My Lady."
00:22:15.410,00:22:17.740,小主进宫前大人千叮万嘱了,00:22:16.600,00:22:18.780,"Your father exhorted you repeatedly, My Lady,"
00:22:18.210,00:22:20.490,小主进宫必是要出人头地的,00:22:19.160,00:22:21.540,that you must get ahead in the palace.
00:22:21.250,00:22:22.910,出人头地是要紧,00:22:22.160,00:22:24.460,"It's important to get ahead,"
00:22:24.050,00:22:26.380,但也不能当了出头鸟被人算计,00:22:24.940,00:22:28.060,"but it's also important not to stand out
and be the target of evil plots."
00:22:27.800,00:22:30.170,皇上喜欢莞嫔是谁都知道的事,00:22:28.820,00:22:31.700,It's known to all that His Majesty likes Concubine Sourire.
00:22:31.430,00:22:34.510,跟在莞嫔身边不会吃亏,00:22:32.480,00:22:35.620,I won't be overlooked if I stay by her side.
00:22:36.980,00:22:38.390,你昨夜才侍寝,00:22:37.600,00:22:39.620,You just served His Majesty last night.
00:22:38.730,00:22:40.390,今日来得早也罢了,00:22:39.740,00:22:41.600,"Not only did you come early today,"
00:22:40.770,00:22:42.680,还亲自伺候本宫梳妆,00:22:41.680,00:22:43.600,but also did my hair for me.
00:22:43.070,00:22:44.180,实在辛苦啊,,,
00:22:44.480,00:22:45.470,臣妾能够进宫,00:22:43.900,00:22:45.440,You must be tired.
00:22:45.730,00:22:46.970,全凭皇后娘娘照应,00:22:45.480,00:22:48.160,"I couldn't have entered the palace
without Your Majesty's grace."
00:22:47.530,00:22:49.810,否则想要伺候娘娘也不能啊,00:22:48.420,00:22:51.340,"Without that, I would not be able to
serve Your Majesty even if I wanted to."
00:22:50.870,00:22:52.820,到底是你的阿玛争气,00:22:51.800,00:22:54.000,The credit goes to your father in any case.
00:22:53.450,00:22:55.160,皇上知道他的功劳,00:22:54.440,00:22:56.380,"If His Majesty didn't recognize his contributions,"
00:22:55.370,00:22:57.990,否则本宫说什么也不管用,00:22:56.380,00:22:58.860,the word I put in for you would mean nothing.
00:22:58.370,00:22:59.740,三年前秀女大选,,,
00:23:00.120,00:23:02.410,臣妾因病错失深以为憾,00:22:59.280,00:23:03.240,"I felt deeply regretful for missing the Selection
due to my sickness three years ago."
00:23:03.000,00:23:05.210,本以为可以指望今年的选秀,00:23:04.040,00:23:06.260,"I thought I wouldn't miss it this year,"
00:23:05.550,00:23:07.040,谁知皇上竟然不选,00:23:06.440,00:23:08.380,But I never expected that His Majesty would cancel it.
00:23:07.510,00:23:09.960,亏得娘娘金口玉言成全臣妾,00:23:08.540,00:23:10.900,"Luckily, Your Majesty's weighty words made my wish come true."
00:23:10.220,00:23:12.130,成全你也是成全满军旗,00:23:11.020,00:23:13.480,Your wish is also that of the Manchu Banners.
00:23:13.180,00:23:14.380,你放眼看看,,,
00:23:14.890,00:23:17.300,宫里除了本宫和富察贵人,00:23:14.140,00:23:15.860,Take a look around the harem.
00:23:17.600,00:23:18.510,是满军旗,00:23:16.000,00:23:19.740,"Apart from myself and Lady Fuca,
who else is from the Manchu Banners?"
00:23:19.100,00:23:21.470,全是汉军旗嫔妃的天下,00:23:20.000,00:23:22.540,This is almost a realm of the Han Banners.
00:23:22.440,00:23:25.810,昔日的华妃是 如今的莞嫔也是,00:23:23.540,00:23:27.140,"Before, it was Consort Fleur.
And now, Concubine Sourire."
00:23:26.570,00:23:27.980,汉军旗专宠,00:23:27.640,00:23:29.600,"When the Han concubines are exclusively in favor,"
00:23:28.570,00:23:31.530,叫咱们满军旗置身何地呀,00:23:29.640,00:23:32.420,can we Manchu Banners have any place in the palace?
00:23:31.700,00:23:33.230,臣妾的阿玛也是这样说,00:23:32.540,00:23:34.280,My father said the same.
00:23:33.530,00:23:35.190,同样是平定年羹尧的功臣,00:23:34.440,00:23:36.480,"They both made contributions in
pacifying Nian Gengyao's rebellion,"
00:23:35.660,00:23:36.270,为何有的可以,,,
00:23:36.540,00:23:38.450,升做吏部尚书兼左都御史,00:23:36.560,00:23:39.460,but why was her father promoted to the dual role of Minister of Personnel and Left Imperial Censor
00:23:38.830,00:23:39.780,而臣妾的阿玛,,,
00:23:40.040,00:23:42.410,却还只是副都御史屈居人下,00:23:39.820,00:23:43.800,"while my father only became an inferior
Deputy Imperial Censor?"
00:23:44.290,00:23:46.030,这个世界有两种人,00:23:45.240,00:23:47.480,There are two kinds of people in this world.
00:23:46.500,00:23:50.500,一种是先甜后苦 二是先苦后甜,00:23:47.540,00:23:51.540,"One takes pleasure first and suffers later,
while the other is the opposite."
00:23:50.880,00:23:53.040,如今就看你选哪一种了,00:23:51.940,00:23:54.100,It's your choice.
00:23:53.390,00:23:55.000,臣妾选择先苦后甜,00:23:54.380,00:23:56.440,I choose to suffer first and reap the rewards later.
00:23:55.680,00:23:58.970,那就好 别人升官发财,00:23:56.760,00:23:57.960,That's good.
,,,00:23:58.420,00:24:00.260,Some officials gain promotions and wealth
00:23:59.220,00:24:01.470,不过是有个得宠的好女儿,00:24:00.280,00:24:02.460,because their daughters gain favor.
00:24:02.020,00:24:03.380,你现在也可以,00:24:03.000,00:24:05.180,Now you can also be that kind of daughter.
00:24:04.560,00:24:07.520,想做一个宠妃最好的办法,00:24:05.680,00:24:08.320,The best way to become a favored concubine
00:24:07.780,00:24:10.520,是日日看着别人如何做一个宠妃,00:24:08.600,00:24:11.700,is to closely observe a favored concubine.
00:24:12.110,00:24:13.100,谢谢皇后娘娘,00:24:13.100,00:24:14.620,I thank Your Majesty.
00:24:16.910,00:24:18.520,皇后娘娘对小主真好,00:24:17.880,00:24:19.820,"Her Majesty is so kind to you, My Lady."
00:24:18.870,00:24:20.480,什么都替小主想得周到,00:24:19.940,00:24:21.720,She considers everything for you.
00:24:21.540,00:24:22.400,不为别的,00:24:22.540,00:24:23.780,That is just because
00:24:22.790,00:24:24.750,皇后娘娘和我都是满军旗,00:24:23.860,00:24:25.900,we are both from the Manchu Banners.
00:24:25.540,00:24:27.000,自然格外厚待一点,00:24:26.480,00:24:28.300,That's why Her Majesty treats me more generously.
00:24:27.670,00:24:30.250,这是一层 小主得皇上宠爱,00:24:28.640,00:24:31.220,"Not only that, but His Majesty
is also fond of you, My Lady."
00:24:30.550,00:24:32.830,皇后娘娘难免也要笼络小主一些,00:24:31.280,00:24:33.780,Her Majesty needs to win you over.
00:24:33.720,00:24:35.080,皇后赏的这些东西,,,
00:24:35.390,00:24:36.750,挑些好的送去给莞嫔,00:24:34.640,00:24:38.040,"Choose some of the best items bestowed by Her
Majesty and give them to Concubine Sourire."
00:24:37.300,00:24:39.590,也算是我与她同住的一点心意,00:24:38.180,00:24:40.720,A gesture from her new guest.
00:24:44.230,00:24:44.970,谁这么大胆,,,
00:24:45.400,00:24:46.890,看见祺贵人也不行礼问安,00:24:45.140,00:24:46.160,Who is it?
,,,00:24:46.340,00:24:48.540,How dare you not bow to Noble Lady Délice?
00:24:51.740,00:24:54.690,我以为是谁 原来是华妃娘娘,00:24:52.460,00:24:54.320,Who did I think it would be?
,,,00:24:54.320,00:24:56.360,Isn't this Her Highness Consort Fleur?
00:24:55.860,00:24:57.200,可是娘娘健忘,00:24:56.840,00:24:58.460,Your Highness is forgetful
00:24:57.830,00:24:59.940,总还惦记着自己满门荣耀,00:24:58.840,00:25:01.020,and still clings to the past glory of your family.
00:25:00.580,00:25:02.570,却忘了树倒猢狲散,00:25:01.480,00:25:04.180,"But you forget that
""When the tree topples, the monkeys scatter""."
00:25:04.370,00:25:08.910,树倒猢狲散这话说得可真好,00:25:05.180,00:25:07.480,"""When the tree topples, the monkeys scatter."""
,,,00:25:08.180,00:25:10.200,What an accurate saying.
00:25:10.130,00:25:11.920,你倚仗家里的功劳进宫,00:25:11.000,00:25:13.140,You entered the harem on your family's contributions.
00:25:12.420,00:25:14.250,和我当初有什么两样,00:25:13.420,00:25:15.660,Do you think you are any different from me?
00:25:15.630,00:25:17.120,你以为做了美梦,00:25:16.760,00:25:18.900,You may have high hopes for yourself.
00:25:18.350,00:25:20.510,只怕会落得跟我一样的下场,00:25:19.360,00:25:21.820,But I am afraid you will end up just like me.
00:25:21.350,00:25:22.590,你不过是个小小的答应,,,
00:25:23.020,00:25:23.970,竟敢冒犯于我,00:25:22.180,00:25:25.120,How dare a lowly Companion offend me?
00:25:25.270,00:25:27.480,等我告诉皇后和莞嫔你就知道了,00:25:25.940,00:25:28.760,"You will know the consequences once I
tell Her Majesty and Concubine Sourire."
00:25:29.060,00:25:32.270,皇后如何莞嫔又如何,00:25:30.200,00:25:33.180,So what if you tell the Empress and Concubine Sourire?
00:25:33.280,00:25:35.310,不都是我当初的手下败将吗,00:25:34.320,00:25:37.000,They were both defeated at my hands.
00:25:36.610,00:25:38.980,更何况你只是依附在,00:25:37.540,00:25:38.780,"Besides,"
00:25:39.410,00:25:41.070,她们身边的一个小贱婢,00:25:39.240,00:25:42.420,you are just a worthless bitch to them.
00:25:42.080,00:25:44.160,即便如今她们一时得意,00:25:43.000,00:25:45.280,"They may be enjoying a moment of satisfaction,"
00:25:44.790,00:25:46.870,难道就没有登高跌重的时候吗,00:25:45.680,00:25:48.620,but there will also be a time when they fall from grace.
00:25:50.750,00:25:51.740,走着瞧吧,00:25:51.440,00:25:53.180,Let's wait and see.
00:26:02.310,00:26:04.510,小主咱们还是快点烧吧,00:26:03.020,00:26:05.180,"My Lady, let's hurry."
00:26:04.930,00:26:06.640,在宫里烧纸钱不合规矩,00:26:05.600,00:26:07.700,The palace forbids burning joss paper.
00:26:06.940,00:26:09.140,这要是被发现了可是重罪啊,00:26:07.840,00:26:10.280,It's a serious offense if we are discovered.
00:26:11.730,00:26:13.770,这翊坤宫现在就你和我,00:26:12.580,00:26:14.920,You and I are the only ones here.
00:26:15.190,00:26:16.730,我又出不了这紫禁城,00:26:15.960,00:26:17.820,I cannot get out of the palace.
00:26:17.820,00:26:19.610,不在这儿给哥哥烧点纸钱,,,
00:26:20.780,00:26:21.570,要去哪儿,00:26:18.700,00:26:22.800,Where else can I go to burn paper for my brother?
00:26:30.670,00:26:31.620,也只有你,00:26:31.620,00:26:33.200,There is only you
00:26:33.300,00:26:36.130,被我连累了还肯跟着我,00:26:34.280,00:26:37.780,"who stayed with me even after
my fall from favor brought you down."
00:26:40.640,00:26:42.470,奴婢从小就侍奉小主,00:26:41.520,00:26:44.020,"I have served you since I was very young, My Lady."
00:26:43.180,00:26:45.140,为小主做什么都是应该的,00:26:44.280,00:26:46.660,I would do anything for you.
00:26:49.600,00:26:51.090,奴婢还是出去看着吧,,,
00:26:51.520,00:26:53.310,今天小主得罪了祺贵人,00:26:50.480,00:26:52.500,"I'd better go outside and watch, My Lady."
00:26:53.820,00:26:54.900,只怕有的闹呢,00:26:52.560,00:26:56.200,"You offended Lady Délice today
and there might be trouble."
00:26:57.190,00:26:58.430,我怕她做什么,00:26:58.100,00:26:59.980,Why would I be afraid of her?
00:26:59.240,00:27:02.610,她要来就来 皇上要杀就杀,00:27:00.200,00:27:01.960,"I'm fine if she wants to come,"
,,,00:27:02.120,00:27:04.400,or if His Majesty wants to kill me.
00:27:04.410,00:27:08.400,我现在活着跟死有什么两样,00:27:05.420,00:27:06.700,"Right now,"
,,,00:27:07.340,00:27:09.560,living is no different from dying to me.
00:27:10.620,00:27:13.710,小主别太伤心了 来日方长啊,00:27:11.660,00:27:13.360,"Don't be so sad, My Lady."
,,,00:27:13.540,00:27:15.440,We still have many days ahead of us.
00:27:16.710,00:27:17.950,可是皇上,00:27:17.880,00:27:19.680,But His Majesty ...
00:27:20.720,00:27:23.500,皇上杀了哥哥 年富 还有年兴,00:27:21.740,00:27:25.100,"He killed my brother, Nian Fu, and Nian Xing."
00:27:24.760,00:27:26.340,与我恩断义绝,00:27:25.740,00:27:27.800,He no longer favors me.
00:27:27.640,00:27:29.260,我还有什么可指望,00:27:28.600,00:27:30.860,What else do I have to live for?
00:27:32.190,00:27:36.350,这辈子就等着老死宫中吧,00:27:33.280,00:27:34.640,This life ...
,,,00:27:35.760,00:27:38.080,will be spent waiting to die here.
00:27:39.820,00:27:41.650,皇上如此绝情,00:27:40.840,00:27:43.240,His Majesty was so merciless ...
00:27:44.370,00:27:46.650,都是因为甄嬛那个贱人,00:27:45.360,00:27:47.920,All because of that bitch Zhen Huan.
00:27:48.950,00:27:53.450,即使我死了 也一定不会放过她,00:27:49.960,00:27:51.880,"Even if I die,"
,,,00:27:52.700,00:27:54.920,I still won't let her go.
00:27:58.460,00:27:59.250,肃喜呢,,,
00:28:00.420,00:28:01.540,按小主的盼咐,00:27:58.980,00:28:00.680,Where is Su Xi?
00:28:01.930,00:28:03.130,肃喜已经去当差了,00:28:01.420,00:28:04.380,"Following your orders, Su Xi went on an errand."
00:28:11.100,00:28:13.010,皇上驾到,00:28:11.820,00:28:14.240,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:28:20.150,00:28:21.020,皇上金安,00:28:21.100,00:28:22.640,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:28:23.240,00:28:25.150,怎么了不高兴,00:28:23.960,00:28:25.180,What's wrong?
00:28:25.780,00:28:27.320,臣妾自打娘胎里出来,00:28:25.360,00:28:26.560,You aren't happy?
00:28:27.620,00:28:30.910,就没受过这种委屈 臣妾失仪了,00:28:26.740,00:28:30.040,"I've never been so insulted since
I came out of my mother's womb."
00:28:31.370,00:28:32.330,到底怎么回事,00:28:30.680,00:28:32.280,Please forgive me for my discourtesy.
00:28:33.210,00:28:34.570,你若是不告诉朕,00:28:32.340,00:28:33.820,What happened exactly?
00:28:34.880,00:28:36.370,朕怎么会知道你的委屈,00:28:34.220,00:28:37.440,"If you don't tell me, how am I supposed to
know your grievances?"
00:28:37.000,00:28:39.410,皇上臣妾初来宫中,00:28:37.880,00:28:40.400,"Your Majesty, I am new in the palace,"
00:28:39.880,00:28:40.410,不知道宫里,,,
00:28:40.670,00:28:42.660,是不是尊卑分明 上下有序,00:28:40.800,00:28:43.680,I don't know if order in the palace is determined by rank?
00:28:43.220,00:28:44.000,那是自然,00:28:44.040,00:28:45.340,Of course.
00:28:45.140,00:28:47.420,若是以下犯上 以卑犯尊,00:28:45.980,00:28:48.280,"If someone of lower rank offends their superiors,"
00:28:47.850,00:28:49.050,是否要按规矩罚处,00:28:48.760,00:28:50.740,shouldn't they be punished according to the rules?
00:28:50.180,00:28:50.890,不错,00:28:51.220,00:28:52.340,They should.
00:28:55.440,00:28:57.100,你看你说了半天,00:28:56.040,00:28:57.400,Look at you.
00:28:57.400,00:28:59.100,还是没有说清楚是怎么回事,00:28:57.520,00:29:00.320,You've said so much yet still haven't gotten to the point.
00:28:59.730,00:29:01.310,朕如何替你做主啊,00:29:00.660,00:29:02.840,How am I supposed to bring you justice?
00:29:04.070,00:29:06.110,臣妾在宫中遇见了年答应,00:29:05.120,00:29:07.500,I encountered Companion Nian in the palace.
00:29:07.530,00:29:10.650,谁知她不仅对臣妾视若无睹,00:29:08.460,00:29:11.520,But she regarded me as nothing
00:29:11.290,00:29:14.150,还讥讽臣妾是倚仗家里功劳进宫,00:29:12.140,00:29:15.500,"and scoffed that I entered the palace
by courtesy of my family's merits."
00:29:15.080,00:29:16.450,自以为是做了美梦,00:29:16.080,00:29:18.160,"She said that regardless of my high hopes,"
00:29:17.630,00:29:19.830,以后却要落得和她一样下场,00:29:18.700,00:29:20.980,I will end up like her.
00:29:27.140,00:29:29.750,年答应脾气不好 你别理她,00:29:28.120,00:29:29.800,Companion Nian has a poor temper.
,,,00:29:29.920,00:29:31.160,Just ignore her.
00:29:32.220,00:29:33.010,你瞧你,00:29:33.120,00:29:34.400,Look at you.
00:29:33.980,00:29:37.390,一生气妆也花了 脸也歪了,00:29:34.940,00:29:38.220,"Your makeup has run and your hair is crooked
due to your crying."
00:29:38.230,00:29:39.390,可不好看了,00:29:39.400,00:29:40.940,It doesn't look pretty anymore.
00:29:40.190,00:29:42.730,皇上偏心 明明说尊卑分明,00:29:41.160,00:29:42.440,Your Majesty is being biased.
00:29:43.110,00:29:44.650,可一听年答应就不管了,00:29:42.500,00:29:46.020,"You just said that concubines must respect their superiors, yet you make an exception for Companion Nian."
00:29:45.320,00:29:46.900,她如今敢这样对臣妾,00:29:46.300,00:29:48.140,She has the nerve to treat me like this now.
00:29:47.320,00:29:49.560,要是 要是哪天杀了臣妾,00:29:48.140,00:29:49.220,What if ...
00:29:49.910,00:29:50.770,也未可知,00:29:49.220,00:29:51.920,Who knows if she will try to end my life one day?
00:29:53.450,00:29:57.040,好了 杀了你朕也心疼,00:29:54.220,00:29:55.340,Fine.
,,,00:29:56.020,00:29:58.520,I would be very sad if you were to get killed.
00:29:58.290,00:30:01.960,去擦把脸这件事朕会处置,00:29:59.200,00:30:00.660,"Go wash your face,"
,,,00:30:00.980,00:30:02.920,and I will handle this matter.
,,,00:30:03.320,00:30:04.400,Really?
,,,00:30:10.500,00:30:12.560,Then I can put my mind at ease.
00:30:02.380,00:30:11.050,真的那臣妾就放心了,,,
00:30:21.360,00:30:22.100,苏培盛,,,
00:30:22.480,00:30:23.140,奴才在,00:30:22.200,00:30:23.240,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:30:23.380,00:30:24.600,Your Majesty.
00:30:24.360,00:30:26.600,祺贵人说的可真有其事吗,00:30:25.260,00:30:27.500,Did what Lady Délice say really happen?
00:30:27.070,00:30:29.610,皇上祺贵人说的也是实情,00:30:27.820,00:30:28.940,"Your Majesty,"
,,,00:30:28.940,00:30:30.920,Lady Délice's words are truthful.
00:30:30.450,00:30:32.780,不过年答应也算事出有因,00:30:31.440,00:30:33.780,But Companion Nian might have had her reasons.
00:30:33.330,00:30:34.990,今日是年羹尧三七,00:30:34.260,00:30:36.200,"Today marks three weeks
since Nian Gengyao's death."
00:30:35.330,00:30:37.320,难怪年答应脾气不好了,00:30:36.300,00:30:38.560,It's no wonder that she was in a bad mood.
00:30:47.420,00:30:50.040,听说昨夜祺贵人伤心了,00:30:48.460,00:30:50.960,I heard that Lady Délice was sad last night.
00:30:50.300,00:30:52.840,女儿家闹脾气也是有的,00:30:51.280,00:30:53.720,Ladies get moody sometimes.
00:30:53.810,00:30:56.050,祺贵人也不是无理取闹的人,00:30:54.820,00:30:57.160,Lady Délice is not an unreasonable person.
00:30:56.520,00:30:59.260,想来这样枢气也是事出有因吧,00:30:57.380,00:31:00.220,There must be a reason she was upset.
00:31:00.520,00:31:02.680,不过就是和年答应枢气罢了,00:31:01.480,00:31:04.080,She was just annoyed by Companion Nian.
00:31:03.480,00:31:04.890,这个年答应也是,00:31:04.440,00:31:06.120,And Companion Nian is really something.
00:31:05.230,00:31:07.980,都到这个地步还这么不安分,00:31:06.180,00:31:08.940,"She's fallen to her current status,
but she still oversteps the bounds."
00:31:08.450,00:31:11.610,年答应屡屡犯上皇上一再宽让,00:31:09.200,00:31:13.000,"Companion Nian has offended her superiors repeatedly,
and Your Majesty has always been tolerant."
00:31:11.990,00:31:13.900,她却变本加厉不知悔改,00:31:13.060,00:31:15.360,But her impertinence has only gotten worse.
00:31:14.490,00:31:16.030,实在有负皇恩哪,00:31:15.500,00:31:17.340,She has squandered Your Majesty’s grace.
00:31:16.500,00:31:17.860,那你说应该怎么办,00:31:17.380,00:31:19.220,So what do you suggest?
00:31:18.790,00:31:19.900,年羹尧已死,00:31:19.740,00:31:21.220,Nian Gengyao is dead.
00:31:20.460,00:31:23.200,皇上留年答应一命已属法外开恩,00:31:21.480,00:31:24.420,"Your Majesty has set aside the
law to spare Companion Nian's life."
00:31:23.920,00:31:25.780,既然年答应不知悔改,00:31:24.780,00:31:26.960,"However, since Companion Nian does not repent,"
00:31:26.250,00:31:27.920,皇上不如严惩年答应,00:31:27.080,00:31:29.300,Your Majesty should punish Companion Nian severely.
00:31:28.510,00:31:31.120,杀之以平后宫之愤,00:31:29.580,00:31:30.700,Execute her
,,,00:31:30.900,00:31:32.500,to calm the anger of the harem.
00:31:34.510,00:31:35.250,来,00:31:35.400,00:31:36.500,Here!
00:31:40.390,00:31:41.510,你倒很聪明,00:31:41.460,00:31:42.920,You're very smart.
00:31:51.360,00:31:52.320,也够狠心,00:31:52.220,00:31:53.720,And also cruel.
00:31:56.370,00:31:58.830,皇帝既然觉得襄嫔忘恩负义,00:31:57.300,00:32:00.180,"Since you think Concubine Aide is ungrateful,"
00:31:59.700,00:32:02.040,再三进言要害死旧主,00:32:00.720,00:32:03.560,"repeatedly suggesting to kill her old master,"
00:32:03.210,00:32:06.290,那么哀家也觉得像这样的人,00:32:04.200,00:32:05.760,then I think
00:32:06.840,00:32:08.670,还是不必留在身边的好,00:32:06.060,00:32:10.000,it is unwise to keep this kind of person around.
00:32:10.590,00:32:12.080,其实儿子也知道,00:32:11.240,00:32:13.140,"In fact, I also know"
00:32:13.430,00:32:15.420,世兰的本性不算太坏,00:32:14.480,00:32:16.560,Shilan is not bad by nature.
00:32:16.510,00:32:17.380,许多事,00:32:17.340,00:32:18.800,Many things
00:32:18.350,00:32:21.390,还是襄嫔在背后出谋划策的缘故,00:32:19.240,00:32:22.540,"happened because Concubine Aide
secretly gave her counsel."
00:32:22.640,00:32:24.730,幸好襄嫔没什么家世,00:32:23.600,00:32:25.860,"Fortunately, Concubine Aide doesn’t have a prominent family."
00:32:25.150,00:32:27.180,皇帝也不是那么宠爱她,00:32:26.020,00:32:28.000,Nor is she in high favor.
00:32:27.520,00:32:29.640,要不然这样狡猾阴毒的女人,00:32:28.260,00:32:30.920,"Otherwise, such a cunning and poisonous woman"
00:32:30.360,00:32:31.690,早就不能留了,00:32:31.380,00:32:33.200,would have been removed long ago.
00:32:33.570,00:32:36.660,可是温宜年幼不能没有生母,00:32:34.300,00:32:37.760,But Wenyi is young and can't be without her birth mother.
00:32:37.870,00:32:40.360,宫里头没有孩子的女人多了,00:32:38.940,00:32:41.740,There are many women in the palace without children.
00:32:41.250,00:32:44.330,哀家瞧敬妃端妃就很好,00:32:42.200,00:32:45.240,I think Consort Estime and Consort Honnête would do well.
00:32:44.880,00:32:46.160,都很喜欢孩子,00:32:45.820,00:32:47.360,They both love children.
00:32:46.590,00:32:48.670,未必就不如她这个生母,00:32:47.580,00:32:49.860,They might even do better than her birth mother.
00:33:02.100,00:33:02.930,小主醒醒,,,
00:33:04.440,00:33:05.890,奴婢将太医开的安神药,00:33:03.120,00:33:04.520,"My Lady, wake up."
00:33:06.150,00:33:06.980,又热了一遍,00:33:05.240,00:33:08.140,"I have reheated the herbal sleep aids
prescribed by the imperial doctors."
00:33:07.560,00:33:09.980,小主喝了再睡吧 能舒服些,00:33:08.480,00:33:11.180,Drink some so you will feel better when you sleep.
00:33:47.650,00:33:48.350,启禀娘娘,,,
00:33:48.940,00:33:49.600,怎么了,00:33:48.580,00:33:49.740,Your Highness.
00:33:50.360,00:33:51.690,奴才这几日留心着,00:33:49.900,00:33:51.120,What’s wrong?
00:33:52.320,00:33:54.100,似乎总有人在外头窥视我们,00:33:51.400,00:33:53.300,I have been watching for the past few days
,,,00:33:53.300,00:33:55.460,and it seems like someone is spying on us outside.
00:33:56.240,00:33:56.980,你看仔细了,00:33:57.040,00:33:58.300,Did you see them clearly?
00:33:57.320,00:33:59.730,是 奴才有两回瞧得不太真切,00:33:58.360,00:34:00.760,"Yes. Twice, I couldn't get a good look."
00:34:00.080,00:34:00.990,有两回看清了,,,
00:34:01.580,00:34:03.030,他装着是在长街打扫,00:34:01.020,00:34:02.520,But another two times I saw him clearly.
00:34:03.660,00:34:05.370,扎扎实实是窝在墙根底下,00:34:02.600,00:34:04.360,He pretends to be cleaning in Long Street.
00:34:05.540,00:34:06.370,听墙角的,00:34:04.700,00:34:07.420,"But actually, he hides under the wall
and eavesdrops in the corner."
00:34:08.080,00:34:10.040,你看清是谁了吗 哪个宫里的,00:34:08.780,00:34:10.960,"Did you see who it was, or which palace he's from?"
00:34:10.500,00:34:11.990,是年答应处的近身太监,,,
00:34:12.340,00:34:13.620,叫肃喜的,00:34:11.260,00:34:13.180,"It's one of Companion Nian's eunuchs,"
00:34:14.210,00:34:15.700,皇上发落了周宁海之后,00:34:13.280,00:34:14.720,named Su Xi.
00:34:16.010,00:34:17.620,就是这个肃喜在伺候年答应,00:34:15.160,00:34:16.800,"After His Majesty punished Zhou Ninghai,"
00:34:18.220,00:34:20.080,奴才还见他随身带有火石一类,00:34:16.900,00:34:18.780,Su Xi replaced him.
00:34:20.350,00:34:21.080,意图不轨,00:34:19.200,00:34:22.100,"Once I even saw him carrying some kind of flint,
seemingly harboring malicious intentions."
00:34:21.510,00:34:22.970,只不过是宫中守卫森严,,,
00:34:23.220,00:34:24.010,他还未曾得手,00:34:22.380,00:34:25.520,"But because the palace is tightly guarded,
he hasn’t been able to do anything yet."
00:34:30.770,00:34:32.230,娘娘是否要让奴才擒了他,,,
00:34:32.440,00:34:33.180,去见皇上,00:34:31.760,00:34:34.140,"Does Your Highness want me to seize him,
and bring him to His Majesty?"
00:34:34.530,00:34:35.230,别理他,,,
00:34:36.190,00:34:37.780,暗地里小心他的举动即可,00:34:35.240,00:34:36.660,Ignore him.
00:34:38.280,00:34:39.190,不许打草惊蛇,00:34:37.020,00:34:38.940,Be careful of what he does secretly.
00:34:39.530,00:34:41.240,嗻 奴才先告退,00:34:39.000,00:34:40.600,Don’t “beat the grass and frighten away the snake”.
,,,00:34:40.600,00:34:42.540,"Yes, Your Highness. I will take my leave."
00:34:53.130,00:34:54.410,今日太阳特别好,00:34:53.980,00:34:55.760,The sun is so nice today.
00:34:55.090,00:34:57.330,去请了眉姐姐来宫里下棋吧,00:34:55.920,00:34:58.440,Go invite Meizhuang to play Go with me.
00:34:58.050,00:34:58.710,是,,,
00:35:00.050,00:35:01.460,只是皇后娘娘今日,00:34:58.980,00:35:00.060,Yes.
00:35:01.760,00:35:03.130,请了祺贵人她们去听戏,00:35:00.960,00:35:04.260,"But Her Majesty the Empress
invited Lady Délice to the opera house."
00:35:03.760,00:35:05.090,小主要不要也去作陪,00:35:04.700,00:35:06.480,"Do you wish to join them, My Lady?"
00:35:05.640,00:35:07.680,听说安贵人也会去的,00:35:06.660,00:35:08.680,I heard that Lady An is going too.
00:35:08.020,00:35:10.510,今日是她们做主角的日子,00:35:08.880,00:35:11.480,"Right now, they're playing the lead role."
00:35:11.150,00:35:12.390,我就不去凑热闹了,00:35:12.000,00:35:13.720,I'm not going to take part in it.
00:35:13.570,00:35:14.600,去请眉姐姐来吧,00:35:13.960,00:35:15.420,Go invite Meizhuang.
00:35:14.770,00:35:15.510,好,00:35:15.820,00:35:17.200,Certainly.
00:35:27.660,00:35:29.870,今天叫姐妹们一起看戏,,,
00:35:30.120,00:35:32.080,是因为很快就到年下了,00:35:28.600,00:35:32.860,"I brought you all here today
because it's almost the [lunar] New Year."
00:35:32.630,00:35:34.330,相信大家都会想家,00:35:33.600,00:35:35.720,I believe that everyone misses home.
00:35:34.750,00:35:37.920,二则是因为不像在景仁宫里面,00:35:35.840,00:35:38.540,"Also, I wanted to take this chance
to speak with everyone freely,"
00:35:38.210,00:35:39.420,说话这么约束,00:35:38.540,00:35:40.740,unlike in the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:35:39.840,00:35:43.430,娘娘慈心臣妾等铭记在心,00:35:40.820,00:35:43.760,We are grateful for Your Majesty's benevolence.
00:35:43.600,00:35:45.180,好了都起来看戏吧,00:35:44.080,00:35:46.120,All right. Let's be seated to enjoy the show.
00:35:45.510,00:35:46.720,谢皇后娘娘,00:35:46.420,00:35:47.860,I thank Your Majesty.
00:35:55.190,00:35:56.560,还好有皇后娘娘在宫里,,,
00:35:57.400,00:35:58.860,否则这一到年下,00:35:56.520,00:35:58.300,We're so fortunate to have Your Majesty.
00:35:59.400,00:36:01.360,臣妾心里总是空落落的,00:35:58.300,00:36:00.300,"Otherwise, as it comes to the New Year,"
,,,00:36:00.300,00:36:02.540,I would feel empty somehow.
00:36:02.280,00:36:05.740,何况呢还要受人委屈看人白眼,00:36:03.320,00:36:06.900,Not to mention the disrespectful behavior I suffered.
00:36:06.410,00:36:07.440,臣妾这心里,00:36:07.240,00:36:08.680,In my heart ...
00:36:07.870,00:36:09.910,进了宫就不像在家里了,00:36:08.840,00:36:11.060,It's no longer like at home in the palace.
00:36:10.410,00:36:12.240,怎么样都会有点委屈,00:36:11.260,00:36:13.700,It's only natural that you would feel somewhat aggrieved.
00:36:14.000,00:36:15.540,不过大家都是姐妹,00:36:14.900,00:36:16.720,But we are all sisters.
00:36:16.290,00:36:17.780,更要互相让着些,,,
00:36:18.380,00:36:19.670,有娘娘宽慰指点,00:36:17.140,00:36:19.100,So we make allowances for each other.
00:36:20.050,00:36:21.410,臣妾心里暖和多了,00:36:19.300,00:36:22.400,"Your Majesty’s comfort and guidance
makes my heart much warmer."
00:36:21.970,00:36:23.550,祺贵人真是会说话,00:36:22.700,00:36:24.840,"Now, isn't Lady Délice a smooth talker?"
00:36:24.300,00:36:26.260,把我们的心里话都给说出来了,00:36:25.160,00:36:27.640,You've spoken the contents of our very hearts.
00:36:28.180,00:36:30.050,倒显得我们笨嘴拙舌的,00:36:28.860,00:36:31.540,"In comparison, the rest of us sound"
00:36:30.730,00:36:32.140,什么话都不会说了,00:36:31.540,00:36:33.460,clumsy and ineloquent.
00:36:34.690,00:36:35.850,听你们这么说话,,,
00:36:36.190,00:36:38.150,就像跟自己家人说话似的,00:36:35.560,00:36:39.020,"Listening to you now, it sounds just like
a conversation with my own family."
00:36:38.530,00:36:39.730,本宫听着舒坦,00:36:39.200,00:36:40.780,It puts me at ease.
00:36:41.150,00:36:43.360,皇后娘娘不嫌弃臣妾罗嗦就好,00:36:42.040,00:36:44.660,As long as Your Majesty doesn't mind my verbosity.
00:36:43.860,00:36:45.600,臣妾家里有两个庶出的妹妹,00:36:44.740,00:36:46.640,I have two sisters born of a secondary wife.
00:36:45.950,00:36:47.190,臣妾和她们说不上话,,,
00:36:47.580,00:36:48.410,可是见了娘娘,00:36:46.760,00:36:48.560,I don't have anything to talk to them about.
00:36:48.620,00:36:50.700,臣妾心里却有好多心里话要说,00:36:48.580,00:36:52.120,"But when I'm around Your Majesty,
my heart is filled with things to say."
00:36:57.460,00:36:59.500,臣妾失言娘娘恕罪,00:36:58.280,00:36:59.500,I misspoke.
,,,00:36:59.720,00:37:01.600,I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:37:03.760,00:37:06.470,皇后娘娘祺贵人她不是有心的,00:37:04.660,00:37:07.460,"Your Majesty, Lady Délice did not mean to."
00:37:06.850,00:37:08.510,无妨都看戏吧,00:37:07.720,00:37:09.940,It’s fine. Let’s watch the show.
00:37:09.140,00:37:10.000,谢皇后娘娘,,,
00:37:10.310,00:37:11.300,请皇后娘娘恕罪,00:37:10.200,00:37:11.260,I thank Your Majesty.
,,,00:37:11.340,00:37:12.900,"Please forgive me, Your Majesty."
00:37:12.640,00:37:13.880,本宫都说过了,00:37:13.580,00:37:15.120,I have already said
00:37:14.270,00:37:17.350,后宫同为姐妹自然不会计较的,00:37:15.220,00:37:18.360,"concubines in the harem are all sisters.
There's no need to be small-minded."
00:37:17.900,00:37:18.560,起来吧,00:37:18.720,00:37:19.780,Rise.
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.730,多谢娘娘宽宏大量,00:37:20.200,00:37:22.040,I thank Your Majesty for your generosity.
00:37:38.170,00:37:39.160,你们都出去吧,00:37:38.920,00:37:40.640,All of you may leave.
00:37:40.130,00:37:41.160,是,00:37:41.120,00:37:42.580,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:37:44.760,00:37:46.920,娘娘也累了不如早些休息,00:37:45.280,00:37:48.080,"Your Majesty must be tired.
You should get some rest."
00:37:47.640,00:37:49.630,和祺贵人说话确实累,00:37:48.360,00:37:50.800,Talking with Lady Délice is tiring indeed.
00:37:50.220,00:37:52.300,可你不同你聪明,00:37:51.300,00:37:53.700,But you are different. You are smart.
00:37:54.480,00:37:55.970,臣妾多谢娘娘抬举,00:37:55.460,00:37:57.340,"I'm flattered, Your Majesty."
00:37:56.770,00:37:57.850,只是臣妾希望,00:37:57.740,00:37:58.980,I just hope
00:37:58.150,00:37:59.810,娘娘不要生祺贵人的气,00:37:59.080,00:38:00.940,Your Majesty isn’t angry at Lady Délice.
00:38:00.440,00:38:02.770,祺贵人愚蠢却实在美丽,00:38:01.360,00:38:03.800,Lady Délice is foolish but beautiful indeed.
00:38:03.280,00:38:05.020,宫中很需要这种女人,00:38:04.040,00:38:06.300,We need this kind of woman in the harem.
00:38:05.700,00:38:07.730,服侍皇上不需要聪明,00:38:06.560,00:38:08.760,Serving His Majesty doesn’t require intelligence.
00:38:08.070,00:38:09.030,只要长得漂亮,00:38:08.800,00:38:10.080,Only a pretty face.
00:38:09.570,00:38:12.490,这样的人却只会分宠而不会专宠,00:38:10.400,00:38:14.020,"This kind of woman will take a portion of
His Majesty's favor, but never exclusively."
00:38:13.660,00:38:16.780,所以本宫喜欢你不是最美,00:38:14.680,00:38:16.160,That's why I like you.
,,,00:38:16.620,00:38:18.260,"You are not the most beautiful,"
00:38:17.330,00:38:19.950,可你聪明乖巧忠于本宫,00:38:18.260,00:38:21.460,"but you are smart, well-behaved, and loyal to me."
00:38:21.630,00:38:24.240,臣妾愚钝能得娘娘垂怜,00:38:22.560,00:38:25.400,I received Your Majesty's grace despite my slow-wits.
00:38:24.760,00:38:25.960,一定忠心耿耿,00:38:25.660,00:38:27.380,I must be loyal and devoted.
00:38:27.130,00:38:30.050,忠心耿耿不是光在嘴里面说,00:38:28.020,00:38:31.020,Loyalty is not proven with words.
00:38:31.180,00:38:34.260,日久见人心 本宫有数,00:38:32.080,00:38:36.400,"""Only the passage of days reveals a person's heart"".
I won't forget what you've done for me."
00:38:35.520,00:38:37.760,臣妾卑微只不过是,,,
00:38:38.060,00:38:39.800,连封号都没有的贵人而已,00:38:36.600,00:38:40.720,I am just a humble Noble Lady without an honorary title.
00:38:40.190,00:38:43.310,比不得祺贵人入宫便如此显赫,00:38:41.100,00:38:44.040,"Unlike Lady Délice, who gained such an
exalted position upon entering the palace."
00:38:43.570,00:38:46.600,出身卑微又如何本宫就是庶出,00:38:44.360,00:38:47.880,"So what of a humble origin?
I was born of a secondary wife."
00:38:47.740,00:38:51.400,所以平生最恨旁人说庶出二字,00:38:48.660,00:38:52.440,"So I resent it the most when people say
""born of a secondary wife""."
00:38:52.240,00:38:54.650,可真想明白了庶出又如何,00:38:53.160,00:38:55.940,"But I've realized that being born
of a secondary wife doesn't matter."
00:38:55.200,00:38:57.360,本宫依旧是母仪天下的皇后,00:38:56.180,00:38:58.680,"I am still the Empress, the Mother of All Under Heaven."
00:38:58.210,00:39:00.570,你的父亲好歹是松阳县丞,00:38:59.260,00:39:02.180,"At least your father is the
Assistant Magistrate of Songyang Village."
00:39:01.380,00:39:03.160,你若真觉得家世寒微,00:39:02.300,00:39:04.420,"If you really think your family is humble,"
00:39:03.460,00:39:06.250,何不凭你的恩宠去扭转干坤,00:39:04.480,00:39:07.280,why don’t you use your favor to turn things around
00:39:06.590,00:39:07.800,平步青云呢,00:39:07.480,00:39:09.000,and rise above the others?
00:39:12.140,00:39:14.000,臣妾多谢皇后娘娘教诲,00:39:13.080,00:39:15.260,I thank Your Majesty for your advice.
00:39:14.760,00:39:16.000,一定谨记在心,00:39:15.600,00:39:17.240,I will always remember it.
00:39:26.570,00:39:28.680,错了错了 我再重下一个子,00:39:27.580,00:39:29.840,No no! Let me take that back.
00:39:29.240,00:39:30.230,不许这样耍赖的,00:39:30.160,00:39:31.740,You can't play like that!
00:39:33.320,00:39:35.490,罢了罢了 眼见是输了,00:39:34.320,00:39:36.520,All right. It's obvious I'm going to lose.
00:39:36.120,00:39:36.950,我不玩了,00:39:36.960,00:39:38.280,I give up.
00:39:38.540,00:39:41.250,这算什么 悔棋不成便耍赖,00:39:39.340,00:39:42.560,"Come on, you can't take back a move when you regret it."
00:39:41.750,00:39:43.240,尽学足了小家子气,00:39:42.800,00:39:44.400,Don't be so petty.
00:39:44.090,00:39:45.450,来我们再来一盘,00:39:44.980,00:39:46.800,Let’s play one more round.
00:39:46.300,00:39:47.630,我心里烦得很,00:39:47.240,00:39:48.760,I feel so annoyed.
00:39:48.210,00:39:51.710,就是再下十局也是个输啊,00:39:49.020,00:39:52.940,"Even if we play ten more games, I'll still lose them all."
00:39:53.890,00:39:55.050,我知道你烦什么,00:39:54.760,00:39:56.340,I know what you're annoyed about.
00:39:56.180,00:39:57.340,可惜时机未到,00:39:57.060,00:39:59.080,"Unfortunately, the time has not yet come."
00:39:58.470,00:40:00.260,人家毕竟受宠了这么多年,00:39:59.480,00:40:01.520,"After all, she was in favor for so many years."
00:40:00.980,00:40:03.890,要结果也不是轻而易举的事,00:40:01.920,00:40:05.080,Ending her once and for all won't be easy.
00:40:04.650,00:40:07.260,你哪里知道我心里的恨,00:40:05.400,00:40:08.380,How would you know the hatred in my heart?
00:40:08.150,00:40:09.520,我只会比你更恨,00:40:08.960,00:40:11.080,I hate her even more than you do.
00:40:10.990,00:40:13.400,我腹中掉下的是我的亲骨肉,00:40:11.840,00:40:14.760,"What I lost from my belly
was my own flesh and blood."
00:40:17.830,00:40:19.280,祺贵人呢回来了吗,00:40:18.740,00:40:20.400,Is Lady Délice back?
00:40:19.620,00:40:21.990,娘娘忘了祺贵人听完了戏,00:40:20.440,00:40:23.080,"Your Highness has forgotten, after watching the show,"
00:40:22.460,00:40:24.540,去敬妃娘娘宫里用晚膳去了,00:40:23.340,00:40:26.020,Lady Délice went to have dinner in Consort Estime's palace.
00:40:26.960,00:40:28.000,外头雪刚化,00:40:27.900,00:40:29.840,The snow outside has just melted.
00:40:29.260,00:40:30.840,她晚上回来怕瞧不见路,00:40:30.140,00:40:32.420,She might have trouble finding her way back.
00:40:31.720,00:40:34.000,你在她殿门口多点上几盏灯吧,00:40:32.680,00:40:35.300,Light a few more lanterns by the entrance to her chamber.
00:40:43.480,00:40:44.220,肃喜来了,,,
00:40:44.600,00:40:45.970,溜进了祺贵人住的偏殿,00:40:44.320,00:40:45.380,Su Xi is here.
00:40:47.980,00:40:48.890,这么多天,00:40:45.400,00:40:47.160,He slipped into Lady Délice's chamber.
00:40:49.650,00:40:51.440,他总算找着下手的机会了,00:40:48.980,00:40:50.460,"After all this time,"
00:40:51.740,00:40:53.480,让不让他下手全看娘娘的,00:40:50.540,00:40:52.460,he finally got an opportunity to make this move.
00:40:54.280,00:40:55.320,我若不成全他,00:40:52.600,00:40:54.980,Whether he is able to or not depends on Your Highness.
00:40:55.870,00:40:57.110,他如何跟他主子交代,00:40:55.140,00:40:56.700,"If I don’t let him,"
00:40:57.740,00:40:59.820,你们主仆两个在打什么哑谜,00:40:56.840,00:40:58.640,how will he reassure his master that he finished the job?
00:41:00.500,00:41:01.330,你先出去等着,00:40:58.720,00:41:00.760,What riddle are you playing at?
00:41:01.960,00:41:03.620,见着火势大了再把他逮住,00:41:01.320,00:41:02.700,Go out and wait for him.
00:41:03.870,00:41:04.410,嗻,00:41:02.860,00:41:04.640,"Once the fire has started, seize him."
,,,00:41:04.800,00:41:05.920,Yes.
00:41:10.960,00:41:11.750,姐姐,00:41:11.760,00:41:12.860,"Meizhuang,"
00:41:12.340,00:41:15.050,想看年世兰如何自掘坟墓吗,00:41:13.020,00:41:16.180,do you want to see how Nian Shilan digs her own grave?
00:41:16.640,00:41:17.340,跟我来,00:41:17.600,00:41:18.900,Follow me.
00:41:25.690,00:41:27.720,祺贵人偏殿暖阁与我这里相连,00:41:26.400,00:41:28.900,Lady Délice's chamber is connected to mine.
00:41:28.440,00:41:29.600,她那儿火势若大起来,,,
00:41:29.940,00:41:30.900,我自然难逃性命,00:41:29.320,00:41:30.700,"If a fire spreads from there,"
00:41:36.660,00:41:37.820,这是梳头的桂花油,00:41:30.700,00:41:32.620,there's no way I would be able to escape.
00:41:38.160,00:41:39.020,你倒它做什么,00:41:37.560,00:41:40.360,"This is the osmanthus oil for combing your hair.
Why are you pouring it out?"
00:41:42.200,00:41:42.910,别出声,00:41:43.160,00:41:44.640,Don't make a sound.
00:41:46.370,00:41:48.330,你要做什么可不许瞒我,00:41:47.460,00:41:49.800,Don't keep me in the dark about your plan!
00:41:50.290,00:41:51.830,年世兰派手下来烧死我,00:41:51.120,00:41:53.200,Nian Shilan sent her servant to burn me to death.
00:41:52.550,00:41:53.290,我不害人,,,
00:41:53.670,00:41:55.000,却也不能让人白白害了我,00:41:53.260,00:41:55.980,"I don’t want to hurt anyone,
but I won't let anyone hurt me either."
00:41:55.760,00:41:58.040,所以你就要帮她一把,00:41:57.196,00:41:59.676,So you are going to give her a hand.
00:41:59.180,00:42:00.630,算是借花献佛吧,00:41:59.840,00:42:02.540,"It's ""presenting Buddha with borrowed flowers""."
00:42:01.640,00:42:04.850,好 既然要做戏就要做足全套,00:42:02.740,00:42:05.640,"Well, if we are going to act out a play,
we'll need a full scene."
00:42:05.440,00:42:07.020,我可不想她再有生路可逃,00:42:05.840,00:42:08.440,I don't want her to have any chance of surviving this.
