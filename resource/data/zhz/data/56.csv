00:02:21.220,00:02:23.210,熹妃回宫,00:02:22.401,00:02:24.395,Consort Lumière returns to the palace!
00:04:15.500,00:04:16.460,臣妾归来,,,
00:04:17.290,00:04:19.710,恭祝皇上 皇后圣体康健,00:04:16.478,00:04:18.059,"Your Majesties, I have returned."
00:04:20.090,00:04:20.920,福泽万年,00:04:18.268,00:04:21.886,I wish Your Majesties good health and eternal blessings.
00:04:28.970,00:04:29.930,一路可好吗,00:04:30.000,00:04:31.448,Was everything good on the trip back?
00:04:30.850,00:04:31.460,都好,00:04:31.828,00:04:32.876,It was.
00:04:33.980,00:04:36.090,皇上一告诉本宫你要回来,00:04:34.958,00:04:37.246,"When His Majesty informed me of your return,"
00:04:36.560,00:04:38.140,本宫开心得不得了啊,00:04:37.494,00:04:39.074,I was overjoyed.
00:04:39.110,00:04:41.600,多谢皇后娘娘关怀备至,00:04:40.248,00:04:42.738,I'm grateful for Your Majesty's care and thoughtfulness.
00:04:44.150,00:04:45.770,果郡王既为册封使,00:04:45.246,00:04:47.511,"Since Noble Prince Guo is the ceremonial envoy,"
00:04:47.320,00:04:51.070,便代朕将册封熹妃之旨晓谕六宫,00:04:48.298,00:04:52.048,"he will announce my conferral on Consort Lumière
to the harem on my behalf."
00:04:51.500,00:04:52.700,此刻诸妃皆在,00:04:52.434,00:04:54.024,"Now that all the concubines are here,"
00:04:53.290,00:04:54.740,劳十七弟宣读吧,00:04:54.224,00:04:55.674,"Yunli, please go ahead."
00:04:55.120,00:04:55.740,是,00:04:56.000,00:04:56.620,Yes.
00:05:05.880,00:05:08.470,奉天承运 皇帝诏曰,00:05:06.858,00:05:09.448,"By the grace of Heaven, His Majesty decrees:"
00:05:09.640,00:05:11.300,惟赞宫廷而衍庆,,,
00:05:11.720,00:05:12.760,端赖柔嘉,00:05:10.574,00:05:13.849,"""I praise the expanding prosperity of the palace
arising from the gentleness and kindness of the harem."""
00:05:13.350,00:05:14.640,钮钴禄甄嬛,,,
00:05:15.480,00:05:17.930,毓质名门 温恭懋着,00:05:14.080,00:05:18.880,"""Niohuru Zhen Huan, from the prestigious family Niohuru,
is distinguished by her dutifulness and decorum."""
00:05:18.690,00:05:20.390,仰承皇太后慈谕,,,
00:05:21.020,00:05:22.180,册为熹妃,00:05:19.624,00:05:23.311,"""At the Empress Dowager's benevolent behest,
I hereby grant her the title of Consort Lumière."""
00:05:23.190,00:05:24.100,钦此,00:05:24.168,00:05:25.326,This is His Majesty’s edict.
00:05:27.860,00:05:28.650,熹妃至此,,,
00:05:29.830,00:05:31.110,臣弟也算功德圆满,00:05:28.838,00:05:30.331,"Now that Consort Lumière has returned,"
00:05:32.290,00:05:33.870,这一路奔波劳苦,00:05:30.764,00:05:32.257,I have accomplished my mission.
00:05:34.370,00:05:35.990,朕该好好谢谢你才是,00:05:33.224,00:05:35.106,It must've been an exhausting journey.
00:05:36.920,00:05:37.950,皇上若高兴的话,00:05:35.348,00:05:37.134,I must reward you generously.
00:05:38.710,00:05:39.820,将珍藏的几幅古画,00:05:37.854,00:05:39.091,"If it pleases Your Majesty,"
00:05:40.250,00:05:41.080,赏给臣弟就是了,00:05:39.644,00:05:42.560,"perhaps you could bestow on me some
of the ancient paintings from your collection"
00:05:41.630,00:05:44.040,免得臣弟日思夜想,00:05:42.830,00:05:45.240,so that I can stop longing for them day and night.
00:05:44.670,00:05:46.630,好随你挑就是,00:05:45.870,00:05:47.830,All right. Take whichever ones you like.
00:05:56.770,00:05:59.050,当年为祈国运昌隆,00:05:57.748,00:06:00.028,"After Consort Lumière gave birth to
the Fourth Prince years ago,"
00:05:59.860,00:06:01.890,熹妃诞下四阿哥后,00:06:00.838,00:06:02.868,she put her own well-being behind
00:06:02.270,00:06:03.230,不顾一己之身,,,
00:06:04.230,00:06:05.720,自请出宫祈福,00:06:03.248,00:06:07.080,"and requested to leave the palace to
pray for blessings for our great nation."
00:06:07.320,00:06:08.730,朕感其心意,00:06:08.520,00:06:10.178,"I am deeply moved by her sacrifice,"
00:06:09.410,00:06:12.240,特册为熹妃迎回宫中,00:06:10.400,00:06:13.727,"so I promoted her to Consort Lumière
and requested the pleasure of her return."
00:06:13.540,00:06:15.490,听说熹妃就是以前的莞嫔,00:06:14.474,00:06:16.800,"Rumor has it Consort Lumière
is the previous Concubine Sourire."
00:06:17.370,00:06:18.490,是不是又怎样,00:06:18.259,00:06:19.545,Does that matter?
00:06:19.210,00:06:21.700,皇上说她是谁 她就是谁,00:06:20.188,00:06:21.543,She is ...
,,,00:06:21.709,00:06:23.340,whoever His Majesty says she is.
00:06:23.630,00:06:25.840,妹妹只当此生再不能见姐姐了,00:06:24.564,00:06:26.940,"Lumière, I thought I would never be able to see you again."
00:06:26.510,00:06:27.540,不想还有今日,00:06:27.444,00:06:28.735,I'd never imagined this very day.
00:06:29.470,00:06:32.080,多年不见妹妹 妹妹一切如旧,00:06:30.359,00:06:33.259,"Years have passed since we last saw each other, Lingrong.
You haven't changed."
00:06:34.970,00:06:37.180,熹妃今日气色不是上佳,00:06:35.904,00:06:38.321,Consort Lumière doesn't look wholly well today.
00:06:37.560,00:06:38.840,兴许是舟车劳顿,00:06:38.538,00:06:40.000,Perhaps because of the exhausting ride.
00:06:39.310,00:06:41.800,有孕在身的人不宜在风口中久站,00:06:40.244,00:06:42.734,A pregnant woman shouldn't keep standing here in the wind.
00:06:42.230,00:06:43.810,还是早点回去休息吧,00:06:43.164,00:06:45.090,You should return to your palace and rest.
00:06:45.650,00:06:47.860,惠嫔欢喜得很呢,00:06:46.584,00:06:49.042,Concubine Vertu has been elated over your return.
00:06:48.700,00:06:50.190,皇上为了迎接妹妹,00:06:49.767,00:06:51.468,"To prepare for your return,"
00:06:50.490,00:06:52.520,特地找人重修了永寿宫呢,00:06:51.468,00:06:53.788,His Majesty had the Palace of Eternal Longevity specially restored.
00:06:54.410,00:06:56.990,皇上为了姐姐的永寿宫费尽心思,00:06:55.388,00:06:58.134,"His Majesty thought of everything for your palace, Lumière."
00:06:57.700,00:06:58.320,又在库里,,,
00:06:58.540,00:07:00.700,寻了多少积年的珍宝出来,00:06:58.678,00:07:01.518,Many antique treasures were retrieved from storage
00:07:01.040,00:07:02.250,也不让咱们看新鲜,,,
00:07:02.710,00:07:04.250,只等姐姐回来开宫呢,00:07:02.018,00:07:05.218,"but we weren't permitted to admire them
until you opened the gates upon your arrival."
00:07:05.090,00:07:07.500,不如姐姐带我们开开眼吧,00:07:06.068,00:07:08.809,"Lumière, seeing such magnificence
would truly open our eyes."
00:07:08.920,00:07:10.330,日后总有去的时候,,,
00:07:10.720,00:07:11.550,何必急于一时呢,00:07:10.000,00:07:12.739,"You will have plenty of time to visit another day.
It's not necessary to do it now."
00:07:12.390,00:07:14.800,先让熹妃安顿下来再说不迟,00:07:13.490,00:07:15.900,Let Consort Lumière settle in first.
00:07:16.510,00:07:18.430,朕陪你回永寿宫,00:07:17.488,00:07:20.000,I will accompany you to the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:07:29.610,00:07:31.150,朕知道你喜欢赏莲,00:07:30.588,00:07:32.439,"I remember you love to see blooming lotus,"
00:07:31.910,00:07:34.190,便叫人挪了这几十缸莲花,,,
00:07:34.570,00:07:35.560,摆在永寿宫前,00:07:32.888,00:07:36.741,"so I had several dozen urns of lotus flowers
moved here to your palace"
00:07:36.530,00:07:37.650,方便你赏玩,00:07:37.279,00:07:38.928,for you to enjoy at your leisure.
00:07:38.910,00:07:39.740,皇上有心,00:07:39.778,00:07:41.040,I thank Your Majesty.
00:07:42.830,00:07:46.250,朕叫他们重修永寿宫的时候,00:07:43.808,00:07:47.518,"When I asked them to refurbish the
Palace of Eternal Longevity,"
00:07:47.500,00:07:49.710,嘱咐他们涂制椒墙,00:07:48.434,00:07:51.017,"I ordered them to replicate the ""pepper-painted walls."""
00:07:50.630,00:07:54.220,昔日椒房贵宠今又在矣,00:07:51.519,00:07:55.109,"Just as before, now you still have your pepper-painted room."
00:07:55.260,00:07:57.590,这些年论谁再得宠,00:07:56.320,00:07:58.720,No one else who gained favor over these years
00:07:57.930,00:08:00.390,皇上也没再赐过椒房恩典哪,00:07:58.942,00:08:01.609,has been granted the honor of a pepper-painted room.
00:08:01.230,00:08:03.810,皇上厚爱臣妾不敢承受,00:08:02.164,00:08:05.120,I am undeserving of such high favor from Your Majesty.
00:08:05.150,00:08:07.100,去看看你的寝殿如何,00:08:06.128,00:08:08.533,"Come, let us go see your sleeping chamber."
,,,00:08:16.000,00:08:17.920,[Virtue renewed daily]
00:08:25.380,00:08:26.080,苏培盛,,,
00:08:26.710,00:08:27.370,奴才在,00:08:26.358,00:08:27.513,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:08:27.688,00:08:28.638,Your Majesty.
00:08:27.920,00:08:30.210,整修永寿宫这事办得不错,00:08:28.854,00:08:31.144,"The refurbishment of the
Palace of Eternal Longevity was done well."
00:08:31.130,00:08:33.870,回头朕要褒奖内务府的督办官员,00:08:32.160,00:08:34.900,"I'll reward the responsible officers
of the Household Department."
00:08:34.590,00:08:35.420,是皇上,00:08:35.568,00:08:36.646,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:08:36.550,00:08:39.090,皇上永寿宫如此奢华,00:08:37.528,00:08:40.234,"Your Majesty, the Palace of Eternal
Longevity exudes such opulence."
00:08:39.470,00:08:40.550,臣妾不敢擅居,00:08:40.480,00:08:41.726,I dare not live here.
00:08:41.220,00:08:43.840,还请皇上让臣妾别殿而居吧,00:08:42.154,00:08:44.774,Please allow me to live in a different residence.
00:08:44.440,00:08:47.770,嬛嬛你在外头受了许多苦,00:08:45.374,00:08:48.704,"Huan Huan, you endured so much hardship outside the palace."
00:08:48.440,00:08:49.930,朕今日所做的,,,
00:08:50.400,00:08:52.520,不过只能补偿万一罢了,00:08:49.374,00:08:53.261,"What I have done could never
be adequate compensation for your suffering."
00:08:52.740,00:08:53.520,皇上言重了,,,
00:08:54.780,00:08:56.060,皇上与臣妾之间,00:08:53.496,00:08:54.918,Your Majesty must not say that.
00:08:56.570,00:08:57.690,没有这样生分的话,00:08:55.758,00:08:59.000,Such words sound as if there is distance between us.
00:08:58.240,00:08:59.360,你不必心有不安,00:08:59.218,00:09:00.726,You don't need to feel uneasy.
00:09:00.450,00:09:03.410,永寿宫的种种布置皆是朕的意思,00:09:01.428,00:09:04.388,"The arrangment was done under my order,"
00:09:03.960,00:09:05.910,皇后更着意添了许多,00:09:04.938,00:09:07.054,and the Empress thoughtfully made many additional contributions.
00:09:06.330,00:09:07.160,无人敢妄论,00:09:07.308,00:09:08.728,Nobody dares to gossip about it.
00:09:11.500,00:09:14.620,此香的香气竟这般香甜,00:09:12.478,00:09:15.598,This incense smells so pleasantly sweet.
00:09:15.630,00:09:19.670,不错这就是鹅梨帐中香的味道,00:09:16.608,00:09:20.648,"Yes, this is the Goose Pear Bedside Incense."
00:09:20.600,00:09:23.340,此香原是南唐国国后周娥皇所制,00:09:21.578,00:09:24.318,"This incense was created by Empress Zhou Ehuang
of the Southern Tang State."
00:09:24.520,00:09:25.720,南唐国破后,00:09:25.498,00:09:27.247,"After the demise of the Southern Tang State,"
00:09:26.560,00:09:28.100,此香已失传已久,00:09:27.538,00:09:29.492,the method of making this incense was long lost.
00:09:28.940,00:09:32.270,不知皇上从何寻得这样的好香,00:09:30.000,00:09:33.330,I wonder how Your Majesty acquired it?
00:09:33.110,00:09:34.720,容儿素擅制香,,,
00:09:35.200,00:09:36.280,这便是她的手艺,00:09:34.088,00:09:37.240,"Lingrong is good at crafting incense;
this incense is her handiwork."
00:09:37.160,00:09:38.190,也难为她了,00:09:38.138,00:09:39.346,"She worked hard on this,"
00:09:38.740,00:09:41.700,配了数百种香料才配得此古方,00:09:39.940,00:09:42.900,mixing hundreds of spices to replicate this ancient incense.
00:09:42.450,00:09:45.290,若换了旁人必没有她这份细心,00:09:43.650,00:09:46.490,No one else has her attentiveness.
00:09:46.790,00:09:48.620,朕有时不得安眠,00:09:47.768,00:09:49.598,"Sometimes my sleep is restless, and"
00:09:49.210,00:09:51.920,闻得此香便能好受许多,00:09:50.222,00:09:52.932,I feel more relaxed when smelling this fragrance.
00:09:52.250,00:09:53.040,果真奇香,,,
00:09:53.760,00:09:55.000,叫臣妾想起了,00:09:53.228,00:09:54.503,What a marvelous incense!
00:09:55.340,00:09:56.830,碎玉轩的梨香满园了,00:09:54.694,00:09:57.827,"It reminds me of the fragrant pear flowers
at the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:09:57.340,00:09:59.920,正是因为碎玉轩的梨树奇佳,00:09:58.274,00:10:01.919,"Those pear trees are excellent,
but they could not be transplanted."
00:10:00.220,00:10:01.050,却不能移植,,,
00:10:01.430,00:10:03.010,才只好以此物代替,00:10:02.408,00:10:04.195,So we use this incense instead.
00:10:06.940,00:10:07.590,苏培盛,,,
00:10:07.850,00:10:08.430,奴才在,00:10:07.918,00:10:08.828,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:10:08.828,00:10:09.739,Yes.
00:10:09.060,00:10:12.300,安排得力的宫人在永寿宫伺候,00:10:10.000,00:10:13.240,"Station capable servants in the
Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:10:12.650,00:10:13.310,皇上放心,00:10:13.628,00:10:14.834,"Your Majesty, rest assured."
00:10:13.900,00:10:16.230,一干人等均已安排妥当,00:10:14.834,00:10:17.164,I've made proper arrangements.
00:10:23.450,00:10:25.360,皇上万安熹妃娘娘吉祥,00:10:24.428,00:10:26.670,"Peace to Your Majesty.
Grace to Your Highness Consort Lumière."
00:10:27.120,00:10:27.830,都起来吧,,,
00:10:28.290,00:10:28.820,嘛,00:10:28.098,00:10:29.098,All rise.
,,,00:10:29.280,00:10:30.000,Yes.
00:10:32.090,00:10:35.120,皇上惠嫔听闻娘娘回宫,00:10:33.024,00:10:36.432,"Your Majesty, Concubine Vertu was afraid
that other servants could not"
00:10:35.670,00:10:37.380,怕旁人伺候娘娘不惯,00:10:36.654,00:10:38.880,properly serve Consort Lumière upon her return.
00:10:37.840,00:10:40.330,所以特让小允子回来侍奉着,00:10:39.102,00:10:42.173,"Therefore, she sent Xiao-Yunzi back
 to serve Consort Lumière."
00:10:46.020,00:10:49.720,论起对熹妃的贴心,00:10:46.998,00:10:50.698,"When it comes to caring for Consort Lumière,"
00:10:50.520,00:10:51.600,莫若惠嫔,00:10:51.498,00:10:53.176,no one comes close to Concubine Vertu.
00:10:53.360,00:10:55.810,朕先去皇额娘那儿请安,00:10:54.294,00:10:56.744,"Now, I'm going to pay my respects to Imperial Mother."
00:10:57.150,00:10:58.360,晚上再来看你,00:10:58.128,00:10:59.504,I will come see you tonight.
00:11:05.160,00:11:06.490,臣妾恭送皇上,00:11:06.138,00:11:07.902,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:11:09.620,00:11:10.660,起驾,00:11:10.598,00:11:11.762,His Majesty departs.
00:11:11.620,00:11:12.910,奴才给熹妃娘娘请安,00:11:12.640,00:11:14.427,Peace to Your Highness Consort Lumière!
00:11:15.500,00:11:16.160,起来吧,00:11:16.434,00:11:17.301,Rise.
00:11:17.090,00:11:17.670,嘛,00:11:18.068,00:11:18.896,Yes.
00:11:20.590,00:11:22.300,惠嫔一向可好,00:11:21.568,00:11:23.402,How is everything with Concubine Vertu?
00:11:22.680,00:11:23.630,都挺好都挺好,,,
00:11:24.180,00:11:25.970,只是皇上已许久不去碎玉轩了,00:11:23.880,00:11:25.203,"Good, everything is good."
00:11:26.810,00:11:27.670,惠嫔和奴才们,00:11:25.380,00:11:27.803,"It's just that it has been a while since
His Majesty visited the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:11:27.970,00:11:29.210,都天天盼着娘娘您回宫呢,00:11:28.010,00:11:30.584,"Concubine Vertu and we servants have been
 looking forward to Your Highness's return."
00:11:29.810,00:11:31.090,过去剩下的老人不多了,,,
00:11:31.520,00:11:32.680,这回内务府又指派了,00:11:31.010,00:11:32.364,There aren't many familiar faces in the palace anymore.
00:11:32.940,00:11:34.470,斐雯 小翠等一干新人,00:11:32.720,00:11:34.495,The Household Department assigned a few new maids
00:11:34.770,00:11:35.430,来伺候娘娘,00:11:34.720,00:11:36.804,including Petunia and Clover to serve Your Highness.
00:11:36.110,00:11:38.890,本宫回宫宫 中可有异动,00:11:37.088,00:11:39.868,"Has there been any unrest
regarding my return to the palace?"
00:11:39.860,00:11:40.850,那些人说些个什么,,,
00:11:41.240,00:11:42.230,娘娘大可不必往心里去,00:11:40.794,00:11:43.328,"Your Highness needn't pay any heed to
what those people are saying."
00:11:42.740,00:11:43.400,倒是,,,
00:11:44.120,00:11:45.780,听说为了大修永寿宫,00:11:43.881,00:11:44.914,"Although,"
00:11:46.280,00:11:47.400,外头大臣们吵个没完,00:11:45.181,00:11:48.858,"I heard the officials argued endlessly over the grand
 refurbishment of the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:11:47.910,00:11:49.280,连恒亲王也极力反对,,,
00:11:49.580,00:11:51.070,一个个上书皇上说,00:11:49.125,00:11:50.589,Even State Prince Heng strongly opposed it.
00:11:51.410,00:11:52.750,说本宫是废妃之身回宫,00:11:50.589,00:11:52.120,They all wrote to His Majesty to say...
00:11:53.170,00:11:53.950,已是闻所未闻,00:11:52.387,00:11:55.239,"They say:  it's already unheard of that a banished
concubine could return to the palace,"
00:11:54.670,00:11:56.030,又如此张扬奢靡,00:11:55.648,00:11:57.440,let alone being so lavished upon;
00:11:56.880,00:11:59.590,是祸乱后宫的妖孽祸水 是不是,00:11:57.858,00:12:00.734,"and that I am an ""ominous flood"" that will
bring misfortune to the harem, don't they?"
00:12:00.090,00:12:01.170,却也没有这般难听,00:12:01.024,00:12:02.560,It's not as unpleasant as that.
00:12:01.760,00:12:04.000,娘娘是四阿哥生母为国祈福,00:12:02.560,00:12:05.408,"Your Highness is the mother of the Fourth Prince,
who prayed for blessings upon our nation."
00:12:04.430,00:12:05.670,谁敢乱提废妃的事,00:12:05.408,00:12:07.245,Who would dare spread rumors of banishment?
00:12:06.970,00:12:09.050,朝臣们哪总是满口酸话,00:12:07.904,00:12:09.984,The court officials are sour about things.
00:12:09.520,00:12:10.220,不要紧的,,,
00:12:10.560,00:12:11.550,娘娘不必听这些,00:12:10.498,00:12:11.480,It doesn't matter.
00:12:11.940,00:12:13.890,要紧的是景仁宫,00:12:11.538,00:12:12.874,Your Highness doesn't need to pay attention.
00:12:15.440,00:12:16.770,永寿宫即便大修,00:12:12.874,00:12:15.218,What matters is the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:12:17.730,00:12:19.060,也不至于奢靡至此,00:12:16.374,00:12:18.533,"Even if the Palace of Eternal Longevity needed extensive repairs,"
00:12:20.240,00:12:21.320,你没听方才说,00:12:18.708,00:12:20.423,it didn't need to be this lavish.
00:12:21.900,00:12:23.360,皇后着意添了许多吗,00:12:21.218,00:12:25.495,"Didn't you hear that ""the Empress
made thoughtful contributions""?"
00:12:25.280,00:12:27.150,我正想着她如何这般好心,00:12:26.456,00:12:28.740,I was wondering why she would be so kind-hearted.
00:12:28.160,00:12:29.870,原来是一边哄着皇上高兴,,,
00:12:30.250,00:12:31.330,博了贤良的名儿,00:12:29.094,00:12:32.834,"It seems that with one hand she was
pleasing His Majesty to earn herself a good name;"
00:12:32.290,00:12:33.820,一边只叫外头的人以为,00:12:33.268,00:12:35.005,"But with the other hand,"
00:12:34.420,00:12:36.830,我狐媚惑主 才引得皇上这般,00:12:35.464,00:12:38.196,"it makes outsiders think that I am a
""minx bewitching her master,"""
00:12:37.590,00:12:39.120,更落实了我祸水之名,00:12:38.196,00:12:40.775,"confirming their belief that I am ""an ominous flood""."
00:12:39.590,00:12:42.370,事已至此 还是思量以后要紧,00:12:40.775,00:12:43.644,"Leave the past in the past.
It's more important to think forward."
00:12:45.090,00:12:45.880,槿汐,00:12:46.024,00:12:47.021,Jinxi.
00:12:46.840,00:12:48.000,你去请温实初来,00:12:47.818,00:12:49.156,Bring Wen Shichu here.
00:13:00.650,00:13:01.770,娘娘请放心,,,
00:13:02.360,00:13:04.070,此物里并没有麝香一类的,00:13:01.628,00:13:03.009,"Your Highness, please rest assured."
00:13:04.400,00:13:05.110,伤胎之药,00:13:03.516,00:13:06.384,"The incense does not contain ingredients
like musk that would harm the baby."
00:13:05.450,00:13:06.440,倒是梨香清甜,,,
00:13:06.950,00:13:08.400,是上好的安神之物,00:13:06.384,00:13:07.928,The pear scent is light and sweet.
00:13:09.830,00:13:11.240,本宫也是小心为上,00:13:07.928,00:13:09.688,It is ideal for calming the nerves.
00:13:11.700,00:13:12.860,娘娘小心是应当的,00:13:10.808,00:13:12.466,I can never be too careful.
00:13:13.450,00:13:15.040,只是微臣多嘴一句,00:13:12.678,00:13:14.339,Your Highness is right to be careful.
00:13:15.750,00:13:16.830,在用此香的时候,00:13:14.339,00:13:16.302,But I need to mention one more thing:
00:13:17.290,00:13:19.330,房中断断不可放有依兰花,00:13:16.728,00:13:20.383,"Ylang-ylang flowers should never be
in the same room with this scent."
00:13:21.380,00:13:22.710,依兰本是无毒之物,,,
00:13:23.090,00:13:24.120,更有安神之效,00:13:22.358,00:13:24.068,Ylang-ylang is a non-toxic herb
,,,00:13:24.068,00:13:25.694,and it can calm the mind.
00:13:24.760,00:13:27.170,莫不成两者相克吗,00:13:25.694,00:13:28.352,Is it because the two have antagonistic properties?
00:13:27.720,00:13:28.500,倒不是相克,00:13:28.654,00:13:30.000,"No, they do not."
00:13:29.050,00:13:32.920,只是两物相遇会使身热情动,00:13:30.000,00:13:31.907,"It's just that, when they combine,"
,,,00:13:32.400,00:13:34.315,they can stimulate sensual desires.
00:13:35.100,00:13:37.760,宫中不许妃嫔擅用媚药迷惑皇上,00:13:36.034,00:13:38.694,"The palace forbids concubines to
seduce His Majesty with stimulating herbs."
00:13:38.190,00:13:39.220,何人敢用此物,00:13:39.168,00:13:40.653,Who would dare use this?
00:13:40.270,00:13:42.560,何况依兰花更是少见了,00:13:41.280,00:13:43.694,"What's more, ylang-ylang is rare."
00:13:45.700,00:13:47.230,娘娘四阿哥求见,00:13:46.634,00:13:48.578,"Your Highness, the Fourth Prince
requests an audience."
00:13:48.490,00:13:49.230,你先回去吧,,,
00:13:50.240,00:13:50.900,微臣告退,00:13:49.468,00:13:50.723,You may leave now.
00:13:52.240,00:13:53.200,请四阿哥进来,00:13:51.169,00:13:52.533,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:13:53.370,00:13:53.950,嘛,00:13:53.056,00:13:54.348,Show the Fourth Prince in.
,,,00:13:54.348,00:13:55.183,Yes.
00:13:59.630,00:14:00.740,儿子给额娘请安,00:14:00.564,00:14:02.188,Peace to Mother.
00:14:04.260,00:14:05.040,快起来,00:14:05.238,00:14:06.184,"Rise, quickly."
00:14:07.470,00:14:08.580,给额娘瞧瞧,00:14:08.404,00:14:10.000,Let me have a look at you.
00:14:10.180,00:14:12.540,长这么大了也长高了,00:14:11.114,00:14:13.474,You've grown up. How tall you are now!
00:14:13.260,00:14:15.130,儿子也有好些时间没见额娘了,00:14:14.194,00:14:16.064,"It's been a long time, Mother."
00:14:15.680,00:14:16.840,心里很想念额娘,,,
00:14:17.600,00:14:18.720,惠嫔娘娘告诉我,00:14:16.658,00:14:17.859,I missed you a lot.
00:14:19.100,00:14:19.930,只要有额娘在,00:14:18.578,00:14:20.078,Her Highness Concubine Vertu told me
,,,00:14:20.078,00:14:21.322,"as long as Mother is here,"
00:14:20.560,00:14:22.800,我就不再是没有额娘的野孩子,00:14:21.538,00:14:23.778,I am no longer an unwanted child.
00:14:23.980,00:14:27.320,有弘历 额娘也不是孤身一人了,00:14:24.958,00:14:26.527,"With you, Hongli,"
00:14:28.700,00:14:29.400,儿子知道,00:14:26.883,00:14:28.654,I'm also not alone anymore.
00:14:30.240,00:14:31.820,宫里面只有额娘最疼我,00:14:30.000,00:14:33.520,"I know that Mother cares about me
more than anyone in the palace."
00:14:33.530,00:14:36.650,弘历你虽然知道额娘疼你,00:14:34.419,00:14:37.663,"Hongli, you know that I care about you."
00:14:37.500,00:14:39.950,但有几句话额娘还是要告诉你,00:14:38.434,00:14:40.925,Let me tell you a few things.
00:14:41.210,00:14:42.490,宫里有你许多额娘,00:14:42.351,00:14:43.838,You have many mothers in the palace.
00:14:43.460,00:14:45.450,有皇额娘还有皇阿玛,00:14:44.349,00:14:46.560,And you have Imperial Mother and Imperial Father.
00:14:46.920,00:14:47.960,可是你要记住,,,
00:14:48.720,00:14:50.130,无论你的生母是谁,00:14:47.765,00:14:49.107,"But you have to remember,"
00:14:50.590,00:14:51.420,你有多想她,00:14:49.654,00:14:52.809,"No matter who your mother was at birth
and no matter how much you miss her,"
00:14:52.180,00:14:55.260,人前人后我都是你的生母,00:14:53.158,00:14:56.238,"in the open and behind closed doors,
I am now your birth mother."
00:14:56.430,00:14:57.720,你不能自怨自艾,,,
00:14:58.600,00:15:00.090,因为你是爱新觉罗氏,00:14:57.408,00:14:59.200,You can't think less of yourself.
00:15:00.520,00:15:01.850,和钮钴禄氏的儿子,00:14:59.534,00:15:02.784,Because you are a son of the Aisin Gioro and Niohuru families.
00:15:03.480,00:15:06.940,额娘的荣辱和你的荣辱是一体的,00:15:04.458,00:15:07.918,My dignity and disgrace are entwined with yours.
00:15:08.150,00:15:09.890,是儿子明白,00:15:09.128,00:15:11.075,"Yes, Mother, I understand."
00:15:12.570,00:15:15.280,额娘回宫宫里的流言不少,00:15:13.504,00:15:16.214,"There is no lack of hearsay
about my return to the palace."
00:15:16.540,00:15:17.990,你听到了就当没听到,00:15:17.518,00:15:19.299,Simply turn a deaf ear to it.
00:15:19.040,00:15:19.820,你只要记住,,,
00:15:20.540,00:15:21.700,你是皇上的儿子,00:15:20.000,00:15:21.474,You only need to remember that
00:15:22.420,00:15:23.660,尊贵的皇子,00:15:21.474,00:15:22.900,you are His Majesty's son -
,,,00:15:23.398,00:15:24.887,"an honorable prince,"
00:15:24.420,00:15:26.000,和其他阿哥都是一样的,00:15:25.354,00:15:27.017,just the same as other princes.
00:15:27.090,00:15:27.670,是,00:15:28.032,00:15:28.695,Yes.
00:15:28.630,00:15:29.500,儿子都记住了,00:15:29.608,00:15:31.128,I will remember all you've said.
00:15:30.930,00:15:31.580,好,00:15:32.130,00:15:32.904,Good.
00:15:39.270,00:15:40.510,给皇后娘娘请安,00:15:40.160,00:15:41.524,I bow before Your Majesty.
00:15:41.060,00:15:44.050,恭祝娘娘凤体康健千岁金安,00:15:42.038,00:15:45.028,"Grandest wishes to Your Majesty
for good health and a millennium of peace."
00:15:44.860,00:15:45.850,起来坐吧,,,
00:15:46.320,00:15:47.020,谢娘娘,00:15:45.838,00:15:46.994,Rise and have a seat.
00:15:47.980,00:15:48.890,剪秋看茶,00:15:47.298,00:15:48.246,I thank Your Majesty.
00:15:49.190,00:15:49.810,是,00:15:48.800,00:15:50.000,"Autumn, serve the tea."
,,,00:15:50.000,00:15:50.910,Yes.
00:15:55.320,00:15:57.690,今儿个也不是初一十五的大日子,00:15:56.298,00:15:58.973,"Today is not special, neither the full nor new moon,"
00:15:57.950,00:15:59.190,熹妃这样早就来了,00:15:59.196,00:16:00.786,yet Consort Lumière arrived before anyone else.
00:16:01.370,00:16:02.990,本该昨日一回宫就来的,00:16:02.304,00:16:04.172,"I should have paid my respects
immediately after my return yesterday."
00:16:03.420,00:16:05.580,因而今日特来向娘娘请罪,00:16:04.354,00:16:06.763,"Therefore, I am here to beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness."
00:16:06.040,00:16:06.950,你有孕在身,,,
00:16:07.590,00:16:09.080,又刚从甘露寺回来,00:16:07.018,00:16:10.240,"You are with child and have just returned
from the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:16:09.760,00:16:11.750,是应该好好地歇息一下,00:16:10.694,00:16:12.932,You should take your time and rest.
00:16:12.260,00:16:14.090,反正日后都要见的,00:16:12.932,00:16:15.000,We will see each other from day to day.
00:16:14.470,00:16:16.080,请安也不急在一时,00:16:15.538,00:16:17.482,No need to rush to pay your respects.
00:16:16.430,00:16:19.050,皇后关怀 臣妾也不敢太放肆,00:16:17.482,00:16:19.895,"Your Majesty is generous and caring.
But I dare not be impertinent."
00:16:20.520,00:16:22.970,臣妾在外 不敢忘了皇后恩德,00:16:21.454,00:16:24.607,"While I was away, I dared not forget
Your Majesty's benevolent graces,"
00:16:23.900,00:16:24.980,因此日日祝祷,,,
00:16:25.520,00:16:27.260,奉了佛珠在佛前开光,00:16:24.834,00:16:26.506,for which I prayed every day.
,,,00:16:26.506,00:16:28.577,"I had these prayer beads consecrated,"
00:16:28.020,00:16:30.520,希望有朝一日可以奉送给娘娘,00:16:28.998,00:16:31.912,"hoping to be able to present them
to Your Majesty one day."
00:16:31.320,00:16:33.650,保佑娘娘岁岁安康,00:16:32.254,00:16:34.874,I wish Your Majesty peace and good health year over year.
00:16:34.990,00:16:36.070,熹妃有心,00:16:35.968,00:16:37.379,Consort Lumière is very thoughtful.
00:16:36.620,00:16:38.530,其实东西还是其次,00:16:37.554,00:16:39.464,This gift is secondary
00:16:38.830,00:16:41.110,最要紧的是妹妹一番聪慧,00:16:39.680,00:16:41.960,"to the fact that you have a wise mind,"
00:16:41.620,00:16:44.410,知道终有一日还能与本宫相见,00:16:42.554,00:16:45.440,and knew you would eventually meet me again one day.
00:16:49.670,00:16:51.000,请皇后娘娘簪花,00:16:50.560,00:16:52.352,"Your Majesty, please put on a blossom."
00:17:03.430,00:17:06.390,熹妃从前服侍本宫簪花的规矩,00:17:04.408,00:17:07.424,"Just as before, Consort Lumière follows this etiquette"
00:17:06.770,00:17:08.010,倒一点都没错,00:17:07.602,00:17:09.078,without the slightest mistake.
00:17:09.480,00:17:10.940,服侍娘娘是应当的,,,
00:17:11.480,00:17:12.720,臣妾不敢忘了规矩,00:17:10.458,00:17:12.255,It's my duty to serve Your Majesty.
00:17:13.190,00:17:14.150,一晃数年,00:17:12.458,00:17:14.168,I dare not forget the proper protocols.
00:17:14.450,00:17:16.400,瞧着熹妃的样子不改分毫,00:17:14.168,00:17:17.928,"Several years have passed in a blink
but time has left not a trace on your countenance."
00:17:16.950,00:17:18.560,倒似更见风韵了,00:17:17.928,00:17:20.000,"In fact, your charm has only grown."
00:17:18.990,00:17:22.200,当真连岁月匆匆都格外疼惜熹妃,00:17:20.207,00:17:23.417,"It's true that the fleeting seasons
tenderly favor Consort Lumière."
00:17:22.580,00:17:25.620,全不似本宫人老珠黄了,00:17:23.514,00:17:26.554,"Unlike me, growing old, like pearls turning yellow."
00:17:26.250,00:17:27.610,皇后娘娘母仪天下,00:17:27.228,00:17:29.043,"Your Majesty is the ""mother of the nation,"""
00:17:28.380,00:17:29.990,如这牡丹雍容华贵,00:17:29.314,00:17:31.728,"like the mudan peony, poised
and magnificently beautiful."
00:17:30.380,00:17:33.040,不知娘娘为何出此伤感之语,00:17:31.728,00:17:34.388,Why does Your Majesty speak such sad words?
00:17:34.420,00:17:35.790,牡丹又如何,,,
00:17:36.090,00:17:38.750,凭它什么花都会有开有谢,00:17:35.398,00:17:39.720,"All flowers blossom and fade.
A peony is no different."
00:17:39.600,00:17:41.050,只是早晚而已,00:17:40.578,00:17:42.400,It is only a matter of time.
00:17:44.060,00:17:46.420,娘娘 各宫嫔妃来请安,00:17:44.994,00:17:47.520,"Your Majesty, the concubines are here
to pay their respects."
00:17:46.770,00:17:47.720,已在外头等候了,00:17:47.748,00:17:48.988,They are waiting outside.
00:17:48.350,00:17:50.640,熹妃一同去吧,00:17:49.239,00:17:51.840,"Consort Lumière, let's go together."
00:17:55.700,00:17:57.310,如今熹妃回来了,00:17:56.678,00:17:58.454,"Now that Consort Lumière is back,"
00:17:57.660,00:18:00.110,敬妃你也要多带着胧月公主,,,
00:18:00.450,00:18:01.910,去熹妃宫里走走,00:17:58.638,00:18:02.888,"Consort Estime, you should take
Princess Longyue to visit Consort Lumière often."
00:18:02.290,00:18:04.400,到底熹妃是胧月的生母,00:18:03.224,00:18:05.440,"After all, Consort Lumière is Longyue's birth mother."
00:18:05.290,00:18:06.780,等熹妃生产之后,00:18:06.224,00:18:07.921,"After Consort Lumière gives birth,"
00:18:07.160,00:18:09.750,胧月公主也该送回永寿宫去,00:18:08.094,00:18:10.850,"Princess Longyue should be sent back to
the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:18:10.330,00:18:11.790,你这个养娘再亲,,,
00:18:12.170,00:18:14.030,到底也比不上人家亲娘,00:18:11.308,00:18:13.436,"A foster mother, no matter how close to her,"
00:18:15.420,00:18:16.460,臣妾遵旨,00:18:13.436,00:18:15.319,cannot compare to her birth mother.
00:18:17.130,00:18:18.000,先坐下吧,00:18:16.398,00:18:17.769,"Yes, Your Majesty."
,,,00:18:18.108,00:18:19.366,"Sit, please."
00:18:19.260,00:18:21.090,对了富贵人呢,00:18:20.194,00:18:22.024,Where is Noble Lady Paix?
00:18:21.470,00:18:22.800,为什么今日没来呢,00:18:22.448,00:18:24.026,Why did not she come today?
00:18:23.310,00:18:26.510,回娘娘富贵人一早起说不舒服,00:18:24.244,00:18:27.444,"Your Majesty, Lady Paix
said she was not feeling well this morning."
00:18:26.930,00:18:28.670,是而不能向皇后请安了,00:18:27.908,00:18:30.000,"Therefore, she is unable to
pay her respects to Your Majesty."
00:18:29.770,00:18:31.010,既然她不舒服,00:18:30.748,00:18:32.198,"Since she’s unwell,"
00:18:31.360,00:18:32.970,就叫太医好好照看着吧,00:18:32.198,00:18:34.193,her doctors will continue her care.
00:18:33.900,00:18:35.980,熹妃啊你有孕,00:18:34.834,00:18:36.914,"Consort Lumière, since you’re pregnant,"
00:18:36.320,00:18:37.980,身子要好好养着才是,00:18:37.178,00:18:38.922,you must carefully nourish yourself.
00:18:38.280,00:18:40.070,要多歇息少走动,00:18:39.200,00:18:41.566,Get more rest and avoid moving around excessively.
00:18:40.870,00:18:43.200,能免的礼数就免了吧,00:18:41.848,00:18:44.018,You are excused from unnecessary courtesies.
00:18:44.290,00:18:45.070,谢娘娘,,,
00:18:45.910,00:18:47.780,熹妃有了四阿哥和公主,00:18:45.268,00:18:46.669,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:48.160,00:18:48.870,这样的福气,00:18:47.095,00:18:49.280,"Having both the Fourth Prince and the Princess,"
00:18:49.420,00:18:51.030,哪里是人人都能学来的,00:18:49.280,00:18:52.091,"Consort Lumière is blessed by Heaven
in a way not everyone could be."
00:18:52.170,00:18:54.580,好了今天就这样吧,00:18:53.104,00:18:55.520,All right. Let's call it a day.
00:18:54.880,00:18:55.790,你们都散了吧,00:18:55.520,00:18:56.891,You all may leave now.
00:18:57.340,00:18:58.920,臣妾告退,00:18:58.274,00:18:59.854,We bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:19:15.520,00:19:17.190,娘娘若是喜欢这合欢花,00:19:16.409,00:19:19.155,"If Your Highness likes the flowers of the ""coupling joy"" tree,"
00:19:17.860,00:19:20.350,不妨多摘一些回去纳入香囊里,00:19:19.155,00:19:21.615,we can pick some and put them into sachets.
00:19:26.200,00:19:28.030,留得住一时也留不住一世,00:19:27.178,00:19:29.656,"They can be kept for a while, but not eternally."
00:19:29.750,00:19:30.910,即便做成香囊,00:19:30.738,00:19:32.385,"Even if we make them into sachets,"
00:19:32.080,00:19:33.290,到底还是要枯萎的,00:19:32.978,00:19:34.723,they will wither away eventually.
00:19:35.290,00:19:36.250,不如随它去吧,00:19:36.490,00:19:37.752,Leave them be.
00:19:38.800,00:19:39.710,熹妃金安,00:19:39.778,00:19:41.060,Peace to Consort Lumière.
00:19:43.890,00:19:45.590,这位妹妹本宫从未见过,00:19:44.868,00:19:46.734,I’ve never seen you before.
00:19:46.310,00:19:47.510,嫔妾是贵人叶氏,,,
00:19:48.180,00:19:49.140,因这两日抱病,00:19:47.288,00:19:49.158,"Your Highness, I am the Noble Lady surnamed Ye."
00:19:49.770,00:19:50.850,未曾与娘娘相见,00:19:49.158,00:19:50.532,"I've been sick recently,"
,,,00:19:50.739,00:19:52.441,so I was unable to meet Your Highness.
00:19:51.480,00:19:53.590,那你如何知晓本宫是熹妃,00:19:52.441,00:19:54.731,Then how do you know that I am Consort Lumière?
00:19:54.190,00:19:55.800,娘娘这样大的阵仗进宫,00:19:55.168,00:19:57.151,"Your Highness returned to the palace
with a grand procession."
00:19:56.440,00:19:57.270,有谁不知道,00:19:57.374,00:19:58.784,Who wouldn’t know Your Highness?
00:20:00.360,00:20:02.190,听闻妹妹今日身子不适,00:20:01.338,00:20:03.416,"Since you are not feeling well,"
00:20:03.610,00:20:05.150,怎么不在宫里好好歇息,00:20:04.544,00:20:06.637,why haven’t you stayed in your palace to rest?
00:20:06.120,00:20:08.150,等下日头毒了越发要难受了,00:20:07.009,00:20:09.120,You will feel worse once the sun gets hotter.
00:20:09.040,00:20:10.070,谢娘娘关怀,00:20:10.000,00:20:11.708,I thank Your Highness for your caring words.
00:20:13.370,00:20:15.370,贵人为何摘了那么多花瓣呢,00:20:14.320,00:20:16.470,Why did you collect so many petals?
00:20:16.880,00:20:18.830,太医说嫔妾病着,00:20:17.858,00:20:20.000,"The imperial doctors said, to treat my illness,"
00:20:19.260,00:20:20.370,需拿合欢花入药,,,
00:20:21.510,00:20:23.120,所以就来收了些,00:20:20.000,00:20:22.039,silk tree flowers should be added to my medicine.
00:20:23.760,00:20:25.550,左不过这落花白白入泥,00:20:22.488,00:20:24.320,That’s why I’m collecting them.
00:20:26.100,00:20:26.750,也是可惜了,00:20:24.594,00:20:27.187,"Otherwise, the fallen petals would only
be left to decay into the soil."
00:20:27.890,00:20:29.220,妹妹怜香惜玉之情,00:20:27.187,00:20:28.360,That would be a pity.
00:20:29.810,00:20:30.800,本宫自愧不如,00:20:28.986,00:20:32.160,"I feel humbled by your tender feeling for
""the fragrant and fair."""
00:20:32.140,00:20:33.180,嫔妾身子不爽,,,
00:20:33.690,00:20:34.800,不能陪娘娘说话了,00:20:33.118,00:20:34.282,"Your Highness,"
00:20:35.560,00:20:36.180,先告辞,00:20:34.538,00:20:36.538,my illness restrains me from conversing with Your Highness.
00:20:40.360,00:20:41.310,她怎么这样无礼,00:20:36.538,00:20:37.950,I take my leave.
00:20:41.940,00:20:43.560,不过是仗着皇上喜欢她罢了,00:20:41.134,00:20:42.626,How can she be so impertinent!
00:20:44.200,00:20:45.860,怪不得别人都说她孤僻桀惊,00:20:42.918,00:20:45.014,She’s just abusing His Majesty's favor of her.
,,,00:20:45.014,00:20:47.194,It’s no wonder they say she’s solitary and unruly.
00:20:58.670,00:20:59.410,娘娘,,,
00:20:59.880,00:21:01.210,奴婢让小厨房进了一碗,00:20:59.604,00:21:00.738,Your Highness.
00:21:01.550,00:21:03.580,安胎定神的桑寄生杜仲贝母汤,00:21:00.738,00:21:04.848,"To soothe prenatal qi, I asked our kitchen to prepare
this sangjisheng soup, stewed with duzhong and beimu."
00:21:03.840,00:21:04.550,您尝尝,00:21:05.026,00:21:06.016,Please have a taste.
00:21:12.270,00:21:13.100,这汤不错,,,
00:21:14.020,00:21:15.300,同样是安胎定神,00:21:13.204,00:21:14.365,It tastes good.
00:21:15.850,00:21:16.510,可比那些,00:21:14.954,00:21:16.994,"To calm the prenatal body and mind,"
00:21:16.900,00:21:18.560,苦得倒胄的安胎药强多了,00:21:16.994,00:21:19.806,this is much better than those bitter and nauseating tonics.
00:21:22.740,00:21:24.520,小主惠嫔娘娘来了,00:21:23.718,00:21:25.964,"My Lady, Her Highness Concubine Vertu is here."
00:21:25.030,00:21:25.770,快请她进来,00:21:25.964,00:21:27.201,"Show her in, quickly!"
00:21:27.620,00:21:29.150,我在门口可都听见了,00:21:28.378,00:21:30.294,I heard all that at the door.
00:21:29.490,00:21:32.070,如今有了身孕 口味愈发刁钻了,00:21:30.468,00:21:33.214,"Now that you're pregnant,
you’re getting more difficult to please."
00:21:33.040,00:21:34.780,我正想着你你就来了,00:21:33.774,00:21:36.058,"I was just thinking about you,
 and here you are!"
00:21:36.040,00:21:37.160,快去拿眉姐姐爱吃的,,,
00:21:37.460,00:21:38.160,枣泥山药糕来,00:21:37.018,00:21:39.200,Go bring Meizhuang’s favorite red date hawthorn cakes.
00:21:38.500,00:21:39.740,茶要碧螺春 快去,00:21:39.422,00:21:41.142,And serve Biluochun for tea. Hurry!
00:21:40.590,00:21:42.830,你惦记着我爱吃枣泥山药糕,00:21:41.524,00:21:43.764,You remember I like red date hawthorn cake.
00:21:43.260,00:21:43.960,我可是记着,,,
00:21:44.300,00:21:46.290,你有了身孕不爱吃太腻的,00:21:44.078,00:21:47.221,"And I was mindful that you dislike
greasy foods when you're pregnant."
00:21:46.630,00:21:47.790,特地做了口味清甜的,,,
00:21:48.180,00:21:49.340,藕粉桂花糖糕来,00:21:47.434,00:21:50.322,"So I made this refreshing
osmanthus lotus root cake for you."
00:21:49.850,00:21:50.500,快尝尝,,,
00:21:51.890,00:21:52.750,这么多年了,00:21:51.050,00:21:52.073,Have some.
00:21:53.770,00:21:54.510,还是姐姐做的,00:21:52.868,00:21:54.482,"No matter how many years have passed,"
00:21:54.890,00:21:56.130,藕粉桂花糖糕最好吃,00:21:54.482,00:21:57.154,your lotus root cake is still the tastiest.
00:21:56.480,00:21:57.810,我在外面也时常想着,,,
00:21:58.350,00:21:59.260,你若是喜欢,00:21:57.154,00:21:59.125,I often thought of it while I was away.
00:21:59.690,00:22:01.100,我便天天做了给你送来,00:21:59.328,00:22:02.101,I'll make it for you every day if you like.
00:22:03.780,00:22:06.060,嬛儿真是想不到,00:22:04.758,00:22:07.334,"Huan’er, I could not have imagined that"
00:22:06.400,00:22:07.640,咱们还能有再见面,,,
00:22:07.990,00:22:09.150,一起说话的日子,00:22:07.334,00:22:09.994,we would again have days when we could sit and talk.
00:22:11.240,00:22:13.900,我既然回来了 你该高兴才是,00:22:12.218,00:22:14.878,"Now that I have returned, you should be happy."
00:22:14.290,00:22:16.120,你回来我当然是高兴的,00:22:15.098,00:22:16.858,Of course I’m happy about this.
00:22:16.830,00:22:17.700,只是少不得,00:22:17.808,00:22:18.858,"However,"
00:22:18.000,00:22:20.360,又要过从前一样不安生的日子,00:22:18.858,00:22:21.504,once again your days will be as restless as before.
00:22:21.420,00:22:23.120,我不知道这样的日子,00:22:22.354,00:22:24.302,I’m not sure whether such a life
00:22:23.420,00:22:25.380,对你是好 还是不好,00:22:24.302,00:22:26.384,"is good for you, or bad."
00:22:26.380,00:22:30.090,或许我不该告诉你伯父的事,00:22:27.514,00:22:28.642,Perhaps ...
00:22:31.850,00:22:32.880,你若不告诉我,00:22:29.098,00:22:31.728,I shouldn’t have told you the news about your father.
00:22:33.760,00:22:34.920,难道我要眼睁睁地看着,00:22:32.739,00:22:34.379,"If you hadn't informed me,"
00:22:35.220,00:22:37.220,自己的父亲病死在甯古塔吗,00:22:34.738,00:22:38.592,"I would be sitting around idly while my father
was dying from his sickness in Ningguta."
00:22:38.890,00:22:39.630,我明白,00:22:40.000,00:22:40.947,I understand.
00:22:40.480,00:22:43.350,咱们这些人哪有为自己活着的,00:22:41.414,00:22:44.534,"You and I and many others ...
we live not for ourselves."
00:22:44.070,00:22:46.430,父母兄弟 亲族门楣,00:22:45.004,00:22:47.764,"Our parents and siblings, and the good names of our clans -"
00:22:46.780,00:22:48.640,无一不是牵挂拖累,00:22:47.880,00:22:49.684,they all burden our hearts.
00:22:50.870,00:22:51.850,不管为了什么,,,
00:22:52.320,00:22:54.410,咱们姐妹能在一起就好了,00:22:51.848,00:22:55.578,"Whatever the reasons, I'm happy that we're back together."
00:22:56.160,00:22:59.400,幸好父亲已经被接回京城医治,00:22:57.094,00:23:00.334,"Fortunately, my father has returned to
the capital to receive treatment."
00:23:00.170,00:23:01.580,我也可以稍稍安心一点,,,
00:23:02.420,00:23:03.500,皇后的头风,00:23:01.148,00:23:02.999,I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.
00:23:03.840,00:23:05.500,只怕要发作得更厉害了,00:23:03.398,00:23:06.458,The Empress will have worse migraine attacks now.
00:23:06.130,00:23:08.870,不过她也不是傻子,00:23:07.108,00:23:10.000,But she was no fool.
00:23:09.470,00:23:12.080,一句危月燕冲月就困住了你,00:23:10.448,00:23:13.560,"She easily delayed your return with the
""Roof mansion impinging on the Moon"" ploy."
00:23:12.470,00:23:13.960,你自己可要当心哪,,,
00:23:14.180,00:23:14.880,我知道,00:23:13.715,00:23:14.938,You must be careful.
,,,00:23:14.938,00:23:15.845,I know.
00:23:16.770,00:23:17.850,不过话说回来,00:23:17.970,00:23:19.444,"With that being said,"
00:23:18.430,00:23:21.100,钦天监里总得要有自己人才好,00:23:19.444,00:23:22.153,"we'd better have our own people
in the Astrological Office."
00:23:21.810,00:23:23.640,钦天监的副使季惟生,,,
00:23:24.060,00:23:25.770,办事倒勤勤勉勉,00:23:22.788,00:23:26.738,"The Deputy Astrological Official Ji Weisheng
is very dedicated to his duties."
00:23:26.190,00:23:28.270,我看是个可用的人才,00:23:27.168,00:23:29.248,He would be a competent candidate.
00:23:29.360,00:23:31.600,那个正使居其位无其言,00:23:30.267,00:23:33.391,"The Head Official speaks but his
""words come from another mouth."""
00:23:32.110,00:23:33.070,也早该歇歇了,,,
00:23:34.070,00:23:35.030,那倒也不难,00:23:33.391,00:23:34.749,Perhaps he needs a break.
,,,00:23:35.004,00:23:36.230,That shouldn't be difficult.
00:23:35.580,00:23:38.530,人吃五谷杂粮 哪有不生病的呢,00:23:36.469,00:23:39.520,"“People eat the five grains and sickness can follow."""
00:23:44.170,00:23:46.160,小主 内务府总管梁多瑞,,,
00:23:46.550,00:23:47.330,送了时新料子来,00:23:45.074,00:23:48.964,"My Lady, the head of Household Department,
Liang Duorui has brought some newly made fabrics."
00:23:48.260,00:23:48.990,叫他进来吧,,,
00:23:49.420,00:23:50.040,好,00:23:49.238,00:23:50.240,Show him in.
,,,00:23:50.620,00:23:51.447,Yes.
00:23:53.640,00:23:54.500,公公请,00:23:54.560,00:23:55.586,"Sir, please come in."
00:24:02.600,00:24:04.690,给熹妃娘娘 惠嫔娘娘请安,00:24:03.555,00:24:06.160,"Peace to Your Highnesses
Consort Lumière and Concubine Vertu."
00:24:05.560,00:24:06.180,起来吧,00:24:06.760,00:24:07.587,Rise.
00:24:09.740,00:24:12.650,皇上说新贡来的蜀锦和苏缎,,,
00:24:13.160,00:24:14.990,请熹妃娘娘您先挑,00:24:10.718,00:24:16.228,"His Majesty said Your Highness will have the first pick
of the new offerings of Sichuan and Suzhou brocade."
00:24:19.080,00:24:19.860,小允子过来,00:24:20.000,00:24:21.563,"Xiao-Yunzi, come here."
00:24:22.460,00:24:24.990,那匹浅碧色的锦缎给富贵人送去,00:24:23.438,00:24:25.968,Send the pale green brocade to Lady Paix.
00:24:25.830,00:24:27.290,本宫看她大约喜欢绿色,,,
00:24:27.710,00:24:29.170,那颜色也衬得起她,00:24:27.030,00:24:30.600,She seems to like green and the color suits her.
00:24:30.380,00:24:31.210,奴才告退,00:24:31.360,00:24:32.940,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:24:33.510,00:24:34.720,你见过甯贵人了,00:24:34.710,00:24:35.920,You've met Lady Paix?
00:24:35.550,00:24:37.760,见过了当真是与众不同,00:24:36.750,00:24:38.960,"Yes, I have. She's truly different."
00:24:39.060,00:24:40.670,小主忘了她先前的样子了吗,00:24:40.260,00:24:42.040,"My Lady, did you forget how she was?"
00:24:41.310,00:24:42.720,送给她这么好的料子做什么,00:24:42.040,00:24:43.920,Why give her such fine brocade?
00:24:43.520,00:24:44.010,我只是想着,,,
00:24:44.400,00:24:46.140,什么人穿什么样的衣服合适,00:24:44.498,00:24:47.276,"I was just thinking about
who the color would look good on."
00:24:46.810,00:24:47.850,这颜色适合她,,,
00:24:48.270,00:24:49.560,我才让小允子给送过去,00:24:47.744,00:24:50.494,"I asked Xiao-Yunzi to take it to her
because this color suits her."
00:24:50.610,00:24:52.350,你和她刚见过一面,,,
00:24:53.070,00:24:54.730,怎么就弄得跟冤家似的呢,00:24:51.588,00:24:55.704,"Why do you treat her like a foe
when you've only met her once?"
00:24:55.110,00:24:55.650,奴婢就是看不惯,,,
00:24:56.070,00:24:56.940,她桀惊不驯的样子,00:24:56.044,00:24:58.102,I just can't tolerate her crass attitude.
00:24:57.370,00:24:58.320,把自己当什么人哪,,,
00:24:58.780,00:24:59.690,怎么那么多话,00:24:58.348,00:24:59.680,Who does she think she is?
00:25:00.540,00:25:01.650,不过一匹料子而已,00:24:59.758,00:25:01.082,That's enough talking.
00:25:03.120,00:25:04.530,小允子 你去告诉甯贵人,00:25:01.440,00:25:02.757,It's just a piece of brocade.
00:25:05.040,00:25:06.160,大热天的不必来谢恩了,00:25:04.098,00:25:07.398,"Xiao-Yunzi, tell Lady Paix that it's hot today
so she need not thank me in person."
00:25:06.420,00:25:07.080,嘛,00:25:07.398,00:25:08.058,Yes.
00:25:08.000,00:25:09.120,我可告诉你一句,,,
00:25:09.460,00:25:10.450,不必对她太好,00:25:08.934,00:25:10.166,But I have to tell you
00:25:10.920,00:25:12.660,太后就头一个不待见她了,00:25:10.166,00:25:11.680,there's no need to be too nice to her.
00:25:13.170,00:25:14.380,她的性子又孤傲,00:25:11.680,00:25:13.846,The Empress Dowager disliked her from the start.
00:25:14.680,00:25:16.760,合宫里没有和她处得来的,00:25:14.327,00:25:15.785,She's arrogant and aloof.
,,,00:25:15.918,00:25:18.250,No one in the harem gets along with her.
00:25:17.590,00:25:20.050,论起来总是皇上喜欢的人,00:25:18.479,00:25:21.146,"However, His Majesty is fond of her,"
00:25:20.720,00:25:22.680,有些场面不得不过,00:25:21.609,00:25:23.915,so some courtesies must be extended.
00:25:28.440,00:25:31.060,额娘我们这是要去哪儿啊,00:25:29.640,00:25:32.082,"Mother, where are we going?"
00:25:31.360,00:25:34.070,胧月额娘带你去给熹娘娘请安,00:25:32.338,00:25:35.270,"Longyue, I'm taking you to pay respects to Consort Lumière."
00:25:34.780,00:25:37.770,就是那天穿得特漂亮的那个吗,00:25:35.714,00:25:38.911,Was she the one wearing the pretty dress that day?
00:25:38.780,00:25:40.520,胧月真聪明就是她,00:25:39.758,00:25:41.581,"You're very smart. Yes, that's her."
00:25:41.740,00:25:43.700,她也是胧月的额娘吗,00:25:42.674,00:25:44.758,Is she also my mother?
00:25:44.080,00:25:46.910,为什么胧月以前都没有见过她,00:25:45.014,00:25:47.844,Why haven‘t I seen her before?
00:25:48.290,00:25:51.380,胧月以前熹娘娘不在宫里啊,00:25:49.345,00:25:52.435,"Longyue, because Consort Lumière
was not living in the palace."
00:25:52.090,00:25:52.750,胧月,,,
00:25:53.380,00:25:55.790,以后你要多去熹娘娘那里玩,00:25:53.024,00:25:56.894,"Longyue, you will visit
Consort Lumière more often from now."
00:25:56.430,00:25:58.290,熹娘娘可喜欢胧月了,00:25:57.408,00:25:59.386,Consort Lumière adores you.
00:25:58.640,00:26:01.720,熹娘娘生得漂亮胧月也喜欢,00:25:59.574,00:26:03.000,"Consort Lumière is pretty. I like her, too."
00:26:02.100,00:26:05.810,可可是我还是最喜欢额娘,00:26:03.377,00:26:07.409,"But - But I like you the most, Mother."
00:26:11.570,00:26:13.270,姐姐的绣功是越发好了,00:26:12.770,00:26:14.883,You're even better at embroidery now.
00:26:15.440,00:26:17.650,我的孩子要赖着姐姐做姨娘,00:26:16.374,00:26:18.708,My child can certainly rely on this aunt.
00:26:18.410,00:26:19.690,你还不多做几件肚兜,00:26:19.388,00:26:20.834,You'd better make some more bibs!
00:26:20.070,00:26:22.030,这些年给胧月做得还少吗,00:26:21.048,00:26:23.200,Haven't I made enough for Longyue?
00:26:22.660,00:26:25.150,差不多都是我和敬妃亲自动手,00:26:23.594,00:26:26.167,Consort Estime and I made nearly all her clothes ourselves.
00:26:26.290,00:26:28.750,你说你要是生上一辈子的孩子,00:26:27.224,00:26:30.000,"If you keep having children the rest of your life,"
00:26:29.080,00:26:29.870,那我岂不是要给你,,,
00:26:30.290,00:26:31.410,做一辈子的衣裳了,00:26:30.000,00:26:32.444,will I be making clothes for you the rest of my days?
00:26:32.000,00:26:33.910,你这算盘也打得真好,00:26:32.934,00:26:35.134,"What a smart way to ""add beads to your abacus!"""
00:26:37.130,00:26:40.620,娘娘敬妃带着胧月公主来了,00:26:38.108,00:26:41.764,"Your Highness, Consort Estime is here
with Princess Longyue."
00:26:41.050,00:26:41.760,快请进来,00:26:41.984,00:26:43.289,Show them in now!
00:26:45.140,00:26:47.050,这里真是凉爽啊,00:26:46.074,00:26:48.160,"Aiya, it's so nice and cool here."
00:26:47.480,00:26:49.560,皇上让人用三个月修的永寿宫,00:26:48.369,00:26:50.710,"After three months of refurbishment
at His Majesty's behest,"
00:26:49.900,00:26:50.680,果然甚好,00:26:50.710,00:26:52.326, this palace is as marvelous as expected.
00:26:53.730,00:26:55.940,胧月快点叫,00:26:54.664,00:26:56.338,"Longyue, greet Her Highness."
00:26:56.240,00:26:57.350,给熹娘娘请安,00:26:56.338,00:26:57.381,What do you say?
00:27:03.450,00:27:04.780,昨日人多不好言谢,00:26:57.381,00:26:58.781,Peace to Consort Lumière.
00:27:05.540,00:27:06.570,今日见到姐姐,00:27:04.408,00:27:07.057,"It wouldn't have been proper to thank you
in front of the crowd yesterday."
00:27:08.910,00:27:10.320,很感谢姐姐多年来,00:27:07.057,00:27:08.293,"Seeing you today, Estime,"
00:27:10.670,00:27:12.700,对胧月的悉心照顾视如己出,00:27:09.920,00:27:13.938,"I extend my gratitude for your taking attentive care
of Longyue and treating her as your own daughter."
00:27:12.960,00:27:14.620,妹妹你我同在妃位,00:27:13.938,00:27:15.945,"Lumière, we are at the same rank."
00:27:15.000,00:27:16.830,岂能行如此大礼快快起来,00:27:15.945,00:27:18.026,You must not bow like this. Please rise.
00:27:19.930,00:27:22.590,这些年要没胧月在我身边,,,
00:27:23.100,00:27:24.130,欢欢笑笑的,00:27:20.864,00:27:25.054,"If I hadn't had Longyue by my side,
bringing me laughter and joy,"
00:27:24.640,00:27:27.000,我这日子还不知道怎么过呢,00:27:25.529,00:27:28.137,I don't know how I would've gotten through these years.
00:27:27.600,00:27:31.430,以前看见曹贵人和齐妃都有孩子,00:27:28.578,00:27:32.408,"In the past, Lady Cao and
Consort Astuce both had children,"
00:27:31.900,00:27:32.980,后来连端妃,,,
00:27:33.360,00:27:34.850,都有温宜公主在月奈前了,00:27:32.834,00:27:36.207,"and later Consort Honnête had
Princess Wenyi ""running around her knees."""
00:27:35.820,00:27:37.150,我真是羡慕得很呢,00:27:36.754,00:27:38.332,How I envied them.
00:27:42.410,00:27:45.270,额娘擦擦 胧月乖乖听话,00:27:43.388,00:27:46.248,"Mother, wipe wipe. Longyue will be good."
00:27:45.990,00:27:48.360,傻孩子什么额不额娘的,00:27:46.968,00:27:49.338,"Silly girl, what ""Mother""?"
00:27:48.830,00:27:51.450,这个熹妃娘娘才是你的亲额娘呢,00:27:49.719,00:27:52.505,Consort Lumière is your real mother.
00:27:51.960,00:27:53.410,快点让额娘抱抱,00:27:52.960,00:27:54.700,"Go, let her hold you."
00:27:54.170,00:27:57.290,好孩子 快点叫你额娘亲一亲哪,00:27:55.104,00:27:58.224,"Good girl, let Mother kiss you."
00:27:57.920,00:27:59.000,额娘抱抱好不好,00:27:58.898,00:28:00.185,Can I give you a hug?
00:28:00.420,00:28:01.210,额娘抱抱,00:28:01.398,00:28:02.668,Let mother hold you.
00:28:03.430,00:28:05.130,额娘不要我了,00:28:04.364,00:28:06.313,"Mother, you don't want me anymore!"
00:28:08.430,00:28:09.170,胧月乖,00:28:09.364,00:28:10.394,"Longyue, be good."
00:28:09.980,00:28:11.760,额娘怎么会不要胧月呢,00:28:10.958,00:28:12.821,How could Mother not want you?
00:28:12.190,00:28:13.890,好了 好了好了啊,00:28:13.168,00:28:14.868,All right. It's all right.
00:28:14.520,00:28:15.760,月儿乖来,,,
00:28:16.110,00:28:17.640,到惠娘娘这儿来好不好,00:28:15.498,00:28:17.088,"Yue'er, good girl, come here."
,,,00:28:17.088,00:28:19.040,Will you come to me?
00:28:18.610,00:28:19.310,来,00:28:19.588,00:28:20.454,Come.
00:28:20.690,00:28:23.030,月儿乖惠娘娘跟你说,00:28:21.624,00:28:24.047,"Yue'er, my dear, let me explain."
00:28:23.660,00:28:25.520,敬妃不是不要你了,00:28:24.638,00:28:26.871,"It's not that Consort Estime doesn't want you,"
00:28:26.240,00:28:28.230,而是多一个人来疼胧月呢,00:28:27.218,00:28:29.663,but now one more person will also love you.
00:28:29.160,00:28:30.120,你说好不好,00:28:30.000,00:28:31.520,Isn't that good?
00:28:31.120,00:28:34.860,你瞧 熹娘娘她多疼爱你 是不是,00:28:32.009,00:28:35.749,"See? Consort Lumière adores you so much, doesn't she?"
00:28:38.170,00:28:39.330,额娘也疼胧月,00:28:39.148,00:28:40.308,I adore Longyue too.
00:28:41.170,00:28:44.130,胧月 来亲一亲额娘好不好,00:28:42.104,00:28:45.064,"Longyue, would you give Mother a kiss?"
00:28:44.510,00:28:45.840,你不是我额娘,00:28:45.064,00:28:46.776,You're not my mother.
00:28:47.430,00:28:49.550,妹妹月儿还小,00:28:48.364,00:28:50.650,"Lumière, Yue'er is still very young."
00:28:50.470,00:28:51.380,你刚刚回宫,,,
00:28:51.890,00:28:53.380,她可能还不认识你呢,00:28:51.404,00:28:55.374,"You just came back to the palace,
and she's not familiar with you."
00:29:03.110,00:29:05.320,娘娘太后午睡快醒了呢,00:29:04.310,00:29:06.634,"Your Highness, Her Majesty the Empress
will soon get up from her nap."
00:29:05.700,00:29:07.860,知道了轿辇备下了吗,00:29:06.634,00:29:08.794,Understood. Is the sedan chair ready?
00:29:08.330,00:29:09.570,奴婢已经领着轿辇,,,
00:29:09.950,00:29:11.030,在永寿宫外候着呢,00:29:09.280,00:29:12.157,"Yes, I've asked the sedan to wait outside
the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:29:15.290,00:29:16.410,你昨儿才回宫,,,
00:29:16.790,00:29:19.030,不如同我一起去向太后请安吧,00:29:16.046,00:29:18.312,"Why not pay respects to the Empress Dowager with me,"
00:29:20.170,00:29:20.830,好,00:29:18.312,00:29:20.000,since you just returned yesterday?
00:29:21.710,00:29:23.920,是啊你们姐妹俩一起去,00:29:21.148,00:29:22.080,Yes.
00:29:24.630,00:29:26.290,互相也有个照应,00:29:22.765,00:29:27.169,Yes. It's good that you can accompany each other.
00:29:27.260,00:29:29.630,那本宫就先回去了,00:29:28.238,00:29:30.608,Then... I'll head back now.
00:29:30.310,00:29:32.340,额娘你别走,00:29:31.492,00:29:33.522,"Mother, don't go!"
00:29:35.440,00:29:36.170,月儿乖,,,
00:29:37.520,00:29:38.760,月儿从今以后,00:29:36.374,00:29:37.477,"Yue'er, be good."
00:29:39.150,00:29:40.230,就要住在永寿宫了,00:29:38.720,00:29:41.483,"You're going to live in the
Palace of Eternal Longevity from now on."
00:29:41.610,00:29:44.440,你要好好地陪陪你亲额娘可好,00:29:42.588,00:29:45.501,"You'll spend time with your birth mother now, won't you?"
00:29:45.110,00:29:46.820,我不我不,00:29:46.044,00:29:47.200,No! No!
00:29:47.280,00:29:48.360,熹娘娘一回来,,,
00:29:48.990,00:29:50.730,额娘就不要我了,00:29:47.200,00:29:51.466,"Consort Lumière came back and now
Mother doesn't want me anymore."
00:29:51.160,00:29:53.820,为什么要叫熹娘娘回来,00:29:52.094,00:29:54.754,Why did Consort Lumière come back?
00:29:54.120,00:29:55.780,胧月你怎么能说这种话呢,00:29:55.098,00:29:57.006,"Longyue, how can you say that?"
00:29:57.750,00:29:58.490,妹妹,00:29:58.684,00:29:59.778,"Lumière,"
00:29:58.920,00:30:00.910,我从来没有教过胧月这么讲话,00:29:59.778,00:30:02.080,I've never taught her to say such things.
00:30:01.590,00:30:03.580,都是以前皇上从来不让我,,,
00:30:04.050,00:30:05.630,在她面前提起你所以,00:30:02.568,00:30:06.578,"It's because His Majesty never allowed me
to speak of you in front of Longyue..."
00:30:05.970,00:30:06.960,我本是废妃之身,00:30:06.904,00:30:08.564,I was banished.
00:30:09.140,00:30:12.090,皇上不告诉公主也是应该的,00:30:10.200,00:30:13.902,"It's reasonable that His Majesty didn't
 tell the princess about me."
00:30:14.140,00:30:15.220,是胧月不懂事,00:30:15.118,00:30:16.405,Longyue is just a child.
00:30:16.230,00:30:17.680,妹妹也不要太伤心了,00:30:17.164,00:30:18.614,Please don't be upset.
00:30:18.560,00:30:20.020,皇上虽然有意隐瞒,,,
00:30:20.900,00:30:22.810,但皇上心里还是疼妹妹的,00:30:19.538,00:30:23.778,"Although His Majesty concealed it,
his heart always held a place for you."
00:30:23.780,00:30:26.270,胧月你看看你,00:30:24.714,00:30:27.204,"Longyue, look at you."
00:30:26.650,00:30:27.980,你把你亲额娘都惹生气了,00:30:27.204,00:30:28.878,You've upset your birth mother.
00:30:28.450,00:30:30.860,快点向你亲额娘认错,00:30:29.250,00:30:31.660,"Now, apologize to your birth mother."
00:30:31.070,00:30:31.780,快,00:30:32.004,00:30:32.921,Go.
00:30:34.870,00:30:36.410,熹娘娘不要生气了,00:30:35.848,00:30:37.595,"Consort Lumière, please don't be mad."
00:30:37.120,00:30:40.210,月儿已经向熹娘娘认错了,00:30:38.054,00:30:41.144,"I am ... apologizing to you, Consort Lumière."
00:30:41.000,00:30:43.870,熹娘娘可不要生气了吧,00:30:41.889,00:30:44.759,Would you please not be mad?
00:30:47.800,00:30:49.760,不哭了 不哭了,00:30:48.778,00:30:50.738,Don't cry. Don't cry.
00:30:51.430,00:30:52.670,原是我不好,00:30:52.364,00:30:53.852,I caused this
00:30:53.510,00:30:55.500,这样突然就让她叫我额娘,00:30:54.444,00:30:56.778,by asking her to call me Mother so abruptly.
00:30:56.930,00:31:00.100,殊不知自她出生三日后,00:30:57.908,00:31:01.078,Who would have expected that we'd never meet again
00:31:01.190,00:31:02.800,我们便再没有见过面了,00:31:02.168,00:31:04.068,only three days after she was born?
00:31:04.860,00:31:05.940,在孩子心里,00:31:05.749,00:31:07.664,"In her heart, Estime,"
00:31:07.190,00:31:09.230,已经把姐姐当作她亲额娘了,00:31:07.664,00:31:10.400,she regards you as her Mother.
00:31:11.570,00:31:12.940,为了胧月这句额娘,00:31:12.593,00:31:15.695,"Seeing how she calls you Mother,"
00:31:14.370,00:31:16.700,我不知道要如何感激姐姐才好,00:31:15.695,00:31:18.358,I cannot adequately express my gratitude.
00:31:18.210,00:31:20.290,妹妹这么说太见外了,00:31:19.269,00:31:21.926,"Lumière, please don't talk as if we were strangers."
00:31:23.290,00:31:23.950,不哭,00:31:24.490,00:31:25.398,Don’t cry.
00:31:27.710,00:31:28.950,我现下怀有身孕,00:31:28.910,00:31:30.316,"Now that I'm pregnant,"
00:31:30.840,00:31:32.380,实在没工夫照顾胧月,00:31:31.774,00:31:33.791,I won't be able to look after Longyue.
00:31:33.720,00:31:35.300,所以在我生产之前,00:31:34.609,00:31:37.023,I hope you can take care of Longyue
00:31:36.180,00:31:38.970,还得把胧月托付给姐姐照料,00:31:37.023,00:31:40.169,before I give birth.
00:31:40.390,00:31:42.930,不知姐姐肯不肯费这个心,00:31:41.440,00:31:44.300,"Would you, Estime, make the effort for me?"
00:31:43.860,00:31:45.220,妹妹既然这么信任我,,,
00:31:45.650,00:31:46.810,我岂有不肯的道理,00:31:44.812,00:31:48.000,"Since you have so much trust in me, I surely will."
00:31:47.650,00:31:49.390,别说照顾胧月几个月,00:31:48.850,00:31:50.756,"Not just several months,"
00:31:50.280,00:31:52.740,就是一辈子我也愿意啊,00:31:51.258,00:31:53.760,I would happily look after her my whole life.
00:31:53.780,00:31:55.610,妹妹还是安心养胎吧,00:31:54.980,00:31:56.934,"Lumière, don't worry, and nourish yourself well."
00:31:57.540,00:31:58.700,嬛儿说的是呢,00:31:58.518,00:31:59.678,"Huan'er is right,"
00:31:59.290,00:32:00.820,现下正怀着身孕,00:32:00.268,00:32:01.922,she is pregnant
00:32:01.210,00:32:02.790,太医又说胎像不稳,00:32:01.922,00:32:03.840,and the doctors said her condition is unstable.
00:32:03.130,00:32:04.990,不能碰着也不能磕着,00:32:04.064,00:32:06.172,She should be careful not to fall or be bumped into.
00:32:05.500,00:32:06.740,胧月还这么小,00:32:06.400,00:32:07.764,Longyue is still very young.
00:32:07.090,00:32:09.420,万一磕着碰着了可怎么好呢,00:32:08.024,00:32:10.437,We wouldn't want any accident to happen.
00:32:10.380,00:32:11.090,是啊,,,
00:32:11.470,00:32:12.420,既然如此,00:32:11.580,00:32:13.350,"That's right. In that case,"
00:32:12.840,00:32:15.130,那我还是先带胧月回咸福宫了,00:32:13.729,00:32:16.433,"I will take Longyue back to
the  Palace of Universal Happiness for now."
00:32:16.430,00:32:17.510,时辰也不早了,,,
00:32:18.180,00:32:18.920,你们两个人,00:32:17.364,00:32:18.834,It’s getting late.
00:32:19.310,00:32:21.760,还是赶快给皇太后去请安吧,00:32:19.114,00:32:22.609,You’d better go pay respects to Her Majesty.
00:32:23.150,00:32:25.930,我们先走了,00:32:24.039,00:32:25.413,We shall ...
,,,00:32:25.948,00:32:27.665,take our leave.
00:32:28.230,00:32:28.970,走,00:32:29.430,00:32:30.336,Let’s go.
00:32:43.580,00:32:45.160,太后怎么先喝上药了,00:32:44.558,00:32:46.518,Your Majesty has already started taking your medicine?
00:32:45.540,00:32:47.410,应该臣妾来喂您才是啊,00:32:46.518,00:32:48.388,I should serve Your Majesty the medicine.
00:32:48.210,00:32:49.250,你来得正好,00:32:49.144,00:32:50.557,You came just in time.
00:32:49.880,00:32:51.040,除了你孙姑姑,00:32:50.858,00:32:52.274,"Apart from Bamboo,"
00:32:51.340,00:32:53.670,也就你伺候得最叫哀家舒坦,00:32:52.274,00:32:54.604,I feel the most comfortable with your attendance.
00:32:58.260,00:32:59.550,臣妾拜见太后,00:32:59.238,00:33:01.038,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:33:00.060,00:33:02.550,愿太后凤体康健福泽万年,00:33:01.038,00:33:03.528,May eternal grace and good health be with Your Majesty.
00:33:02.980,00:33:03.760,回来了,00:33:03.958,00:33:05.111,You have returned.
00:33:05.230,00:33:07.010,永寿宫住得还习惯,00:33:06.164,00:33:08.317,How do you like living in the Palace of Eternal Longevity?
00:33:08.360,00:33:09.770,永寿宫太过奢华,,,
00:33:10.230,00:33:11.220,臣妾很是不安,00:33:09.294,00:33:13.108,"Your Majesty, the luxuriousness of the Palace
of Eternal Longevity unsettles me greatly."
00:33:12.740,00:33:15.570,虽然奢华皇帝要宠着你,,,
00:33:15.950,00:33:16.690,也不算什么,00:33:13.922,00:33:17.844,"It is luxurious indeed, but appropriate
 since the emperor dotes on you."
00:33:21.580,00:33:23.660,这药喝得哀家舌头发苦,00:33:22.558,00:33:24.762,This medicine leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
00:33:24.210,00:33:25.290,去倒掉也罢,00:33:25.022,00:33:26.435,Might as well pour it out.
00:33:25.750,00:33:27.960,臣妾就说太后越活越年轻,00:33:26.684,00:33:29.143,"I've been saying Your Majesty
is getting younger by the day!"
00:33:28.340,00:33:29.290,太后还不信,,,
00:33:29.460,00:33:30.870,非说臣妾哄您,00:33:29.318,00:33:32.000,And Your Majesty doesn't believe me.
00:33:31.510,00:33:33.710,如今这怕苦不肯吃药,00:33:32.000,00:33:34.984,"Now Your Majesty refuses to take
medicine because it's bitter"
00:33:34.050,00:33:35.260,又闹小孩子的脾气,,,
00:33:35.590,00:33:37.050,可不是越活越年轻了,00:33:34.984,00:33:36.568,just like a child!
00:33:39.010,00:33:40.590,一向哀家瞧着你,00:33:36.568,00:33:38.549,Truly Your Majesty is growing younger.
00:33:40.930,00:33:42.050,是多稳重的一个人,00:33:40.000,00:33:42.984,I've always seen you as stable and prudent.
00:33:42.470,00:33:45.560,如今也学会油嘴滑舌了,00:33:43.448,00:33:46.538,"Now you've learned to ""talk with an oiled tongue."""
00:33:45.890,00:33:46.760,药喝得太苦,,,
00:33:47.100,00:33:48.640,怄太后笑一笑罢了,00:33:46.824,00:33:49.600,"Since the medicine is bitter, I just hope
to coax a smile from Your Majesty."
00:33:49.230,00:33:49.890,来,00:33:50.208,00:33:51.158,Here.
00:33:55.320,00:33:57.030,有身子的人还叫跪着,00:33:56.209,00:33:58.240,A pregnant woman shouldn't be kneeling for so long.
00:33:57.990,00:33:59.570,你来服侍哀家漱口,00:33:58.968,00:34:00.672,You'll help me rinse my mouth.
00:34:00.120,00:34:00.650,是,00:34:01.098,00:34:02.042,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:34:29.850,00:34:31.720,服侍人的功夫见长,00:34:30.828,00:34:33.195,You are more skillful in your service now.
00:34:32.650,00:34:34.690,难怪去了甘露寺那么久,,,
00:34:35.030,00:34:36.860,还叫皇帝念念不忘,00:34:33.628,00:34:38.326,"No wonder the emperor still clung to thoughts of you
even long after you left for the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:34:37.990,00:34:40.600,倒真学会了狐媚惑主那一套,00:34:39.013,00:34:41.706,"You really have become
""a bewitching minx to her master."""
00:34:42.580,00:34:45.320,太后言重了臣妾实在惶恐,00:34:43.292,00:34:46.032,Your Majesty's words inspire terror in me.
00:34:45.580,00:34:46.360,惶恐,00:34:46.506,00:34:47.493,Terror?
00:34:47.660,00:34:51.450,怎么熹妃怀有龙胎 君恩厚重,00:34:48.816,00:34:52.640,"Consort Lumière, you are the bearer of
an imperial heir and the emperor's deep favor."
00:34:52.040,00:34:53.330,也会觉得惶恐,00:34:53.018,00:34:54.722,Why would you feel terrified?
00:34:53.920,00:34:55.160,臣妾乃戴罪之身,00:34:54.898,00:34:56.687,Because I am the bearer of an offense.
00:34:56.300,00:34:58.840,皇上顾念旧情来甘露寺探望,00:34:57.189,00:35:00.423,"When His Majesty cherished his
past affections and visited me at the temple,"
00:34:59.470,00:35:00.670,臣妾感激涕零,00:35:00.423,00:35:01.760,I felt eternally grateful.
00:35:02.100,00:35:03.340,不想一朝有孕,,,
00:35:04.470,00:35:06.460,皇上思虑皇儿是皇室血脉,00:35:03.300,00:35:05.208,I didn't expect to become pregnant from the visit.
00:35:06.980,00:35:08.180,不忍其流落在外,00:35:05.670,00:35:08.080,His Majesty has shown exceptional pity for me
00:35:08.940,00:35:11.300,所以格外怜悯臣妾,00:35:08.080,00:35:12.604,"only because of his care for the heir
 and the imperial bloodline."
00:35:13.110,00:35:14.220,如此说来,00:35:14.088,00:35:15.542,Are you saying
00:35:14.860,00:35:17.940,甘露寺一事只是你与皇上偶遇,00:35:15.838,00:35:18.918,"your reunion with the emperor
was merely a chance encounter"
00:35:18.320,00:35:20.810,并非故意设计又重博圣宠吗,00:35:19.254,00:35:21.951,rather than a plotted effort to regain his favor?
00:35:24.580,00:35:26.110,臣妾不敢欺瞒太后,00:35:25.612,00:35:27.349,I dare not deceive Your Majesty.
00:35:27.410,00:35:29.400,皇上与臣妾并非偶遇,00:35:28.610,00:35:30.766,It was not a chance encounter.
00:35:31.040,00:35:34.030,因为当时臣妾未出月而离宫,00:35:32.018,00:35:36.618,"I had been unwell because I left the
palace during the first postnatal month."
00:35:34.500,00:35:35.660,身子一直不好,,,
00:35:36.590,00:35:39.130,所以迁居凌云峰长住,00:35:37.568,00:35:40.626,"So, I moved to the living quarters at Peak Lingyun."
00:35:40.970,00:35:42.920,皇上来甘露寺时不见臣妾,00:35:41.948,00:35:44.280,"When His Majesty visited and
didn't see me at the temple,"
00:35:43.260,00:35:44.380,以为臣妾还病着,00:35:44.280,00:35:45.853,he thought I was still ill.
00:35:45.100,00:35:46.680,故而到了凌云峰探望,00:35:46.078,00:35:48.047,So His Majesty went to Peak Lingyun to see me.
00:35:48.430,00:35:52.140,果真如此倒是哀家错怪你了,00:35:49.275,00:35:50.880,Is that so?
,,,00:35:50.983,00:35:53.358,"I've blamed you wrongly, it seems."
00:35:53.360,00:35:56.270,是臣妾未及时向太后禀明情由,00:35:54.294,00:35:57.834,"It is my fault that I did not make a
timely report of the matter to Your Majesty."
00:35:56.650,00:35:57.510,臣妾有罪,00:35:57.834,00:35:59.200,I admit my offense.
00:35:58.360,00:36:00.320,当日你执意离宫修行,00:35:59.294,00:36:01.461,"When you insisted on leaving the palace,"
00:36:01.200,00:36:03.610,连刚生的女儿都可以撇下,00:36:02.134,00:36:04.751,"you were even able to leave behind
your newborn daughter."
00:36:04.240,00:36:07.530,如今怎么又肯跟皇帝重修旧好,00:36:05.174,00:36:08.464,"Why, now, are you are willing to
reconcile with the emperor"
00:36:07.950,00:36:09.070,还有了孩子,00:36:08.928,00:36:10.488,and have a child with him?
00:36:13.500,00:36:14.160,太后,00:36:14.493,00:36:15.360,Your Majesty ...
00:36:14.380,00:36:17.210,哀家跟她说话你插什么嘴,00:36:15.360,00:36:17.983,"I am talking to her, not you."
00:36:21.090,00:36:22.380,皇上是一国之君,00:36:22.290,00:36:24.077,"His Majesty is the sovereign of the nation,"
00:36:23.430,00:36:24.840,不是臣妾一人之君,00:36:24.630,00:36:26.080,and not just my husband.
00:36:25.890,00:36:28.880,朝堂之事臣妾虽为父亲伤心,00:36:27.090,00:36:30.411,"Even though I was saddened by
what happened in court to my father,"
00:36:29.770,00:36:31.220,却也只会恨诬陷之人,,,
00:36:31.730,00:36:32.720,不敢怨恨皇上,00:36:30.970,00:36:34.577,"I despised those who defamed him, but I never dared to hold a grudge against His Majesty."
00:36:34.980,00:36:36.560,臣妾当日执意离宫,00:36:36.180,00:36:38.080,I insisted on leaving the palace
00:36:37.690,00:36:39.850,是以为皇上对臣妾毫无情分,,,
00:36:40.240,00:36:41.400,因而万念俱灰,00:36:38.890,00:36:42.720,"because I thought His Majesty had lost all
affection for me, turning my hopes to ashes."
00:36:42.900,00:36:44.270,可皇上来看臣妾,,,
00:36:45.280,00:36:47.150,臣妾就知道皇上并非无情,00:36:44.100,00:36:48.320,"But when His Majesty came to visit me,
I knew he was not without affection."
00:36:48.450,00:36:49.740,今日侥幸回宫,,,
00:36:50.700,00:36:52.620,臣妾只想安心侍奉皇上,00:36:49.650,00:36:51.865,It's an unimagined fortune that I could return to the palace.
00:36:53.080,00:36:53.870,弥补过错,00:36:51.865,00:36:55.194,"Now I only want to devote myself to
serving His Majesty to mend my mistakes."
00:36:59.090,00:36:59.830,你起来吧,00:37:00.000,00:37:01.208,You may rise.
00:37:01.210,00:37:02.000,谢太后,00:37:02.188,00:37:03.451,I thank Your Majesty.
00:37:07.010,00:37:08.630,一向总说你体贴,,,
00:37:08.970,00:37:10.430,你怎么看着熹妃这样跪着,00:37:07.988,00:37:09.774,You're usually the considerate one.
00:37:10.850,00:37:12.390,也不提醒哀家叫她起来,00:37:10.000,00:37:13.430,"Why didn't you remind me to ask
Consort Lumière to rise?"
00:37:13.140,00:37:14.470,哀家是病糊涂了,,,
00:37:14.810,00:37:15.770,你也病糊涂了吗,00:37:14.118,00:37:16.738,"I may be sick and confused, but are you too?"
00:37:16.400,00:37:18.140,太后熹妃跪着,00:37:17.334,00:37:19.287,"Your Majesty, Consort Lumière was kneeling"
00:37:18.360,00:37:20.560,就是她肚子里太后的孙儿跪着,00:37:19.287,00:37:21.781,so your grandchild could kneel and bow to you.
00:37:21.030,00:37:23.020,一家子都向太后请安行礼,,,
00:37:23.450,00:37:25.280,难道臣妾还要去才阑吗,00:37:22.212,00:37:26.462,"How could I stop them from
greeting Your Majesty as a family?"
00:37:26.740,00:37:27.780,数你嘴甜,00:37:27.674,00:37:28.962,That is very sweet of you.
00:37:33.620,00:37:34.410,赐座吧,00:37:34.598,00:37:35.994,Grant Consort Lumière a seat.
00:37:43.670,00:37:45.160,不要怪哀家苛责,00:37:44.604,00:37:46.660,Don't blame me for being tough on you.
00:37:46.630,00:37:48.550,皇帝是哀家亲生的,00:37:47.608,00:37:49.652,The emperor is my son
00:37:49.140,00:37:51.500,哀家也怕再招进一个狐媚的,00:37:50.000,00:37:52.750,so I was afraid he would have another minx by his side.
00:37:52.930,00:37:54.760,如今你已在妃位,00:37:53.908,00:37:55.862,"Now that you are ranked at Consort,"
00:37:55.770,00:37:58.260,这样穿着太简朴了些,00:37:56.748,00:37:59.362,your ensemble is too simple for your title.
00:38:00.480,00:38:03.600,臣妾修行已久不喜太过奢华,00:38:01.680,00:38:05.080,"I have been practicing Buddhism,
so I don't prefer extravagance."
00:38:05.530,00:38:06.730,你能这样懂事,00:38:06.508,00:38:08.096,You are very sensible.
00:38:07.660,00:38:09.770,也不枉哀家这些年疼你,00:38:08.505,00:38:11.029,And worthy of the care I've provided these past years.
00:38:10.580,00:38:11.780,臣妾在甘露寺时,,,
00:38:12.540,00:38:14.280,幸亏有太后百般照拂,00:38:11.514,00:38:16.022,"I was blessed to have Your Majesty's care
bestowed upon me at the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:38:14.830,00:38:16.070,臣妾没齿难忘,,,
00:38:16.620,00:38:17.530,既已回宫,00:38:16.022,00:38:17.554,I am eternally grateful.
00:38:17.960,00:38:20.240,以后就当没有甘露寺这回事,00:38:17.554,00:38:21.174,"Henceforth, consider the Temple of Pure Dew
as if it never happened."
00:38:21.340,00:38:23.290,这话哀家会盼咐旁人,00:38:22.274,00:38:24.472,I will order others to think the same.
00:38:23.800,00:38:25.160,你自己也要记得,00:38:24.778,00:38:26.138,You must remember that
00:38:26.470,00:38:28.250,有甘露寺这三个字在,,,
00:38:29.220,00:38:31.800,你以后的日子也不会好过,00:38:27.404,00:38:32.734,your life won't be easy if associated with the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:38:36.230,00:38:37.340,有四个月了吧,00:38:37.208,00:38:38.982,"You are four months pregnant, correct?"
00:38:38.690,00:38:39.300,是,00:38:39.668,00:38:40.526,Yes.
00:38:41.940,00:38:43.520,皇帝年纪渐长,00:38:43.000,00:38:44.802,"The Emperor is getting on in years,"
00:38:44.280,00:38:47.610,但是身边的人却不如以往清净,00:38:45.480,00:38:48.810,"and his favored concubines
do not bring peace to the harem."
00:38:48.820,00:38:50.610,现在你既然回来了,00:38:50.020,00:38:52.185,"Now that you are back,"
00:38:51.490,00:38:54.110,凡事都要规劝着皇上,00:38:52.765,00:38:55.200,you should always advise restraint to him.
00:38:54.700,00:38:57.070,想必他也能听进去几句,00:38:55.767,00:38:58.268,"He will listen to you, more or less."
00:38:57.660,00:38:59.120,臣妾谨遵太后教诲,00:38:58.638,00:39:00.556,I will obey Your Majesty's guidance.
00:39:00.330,00:39:02.070,必不忘妾妃之德,00:39:01.178,00:39:03.533,I will fulfill the duties and virtues of a Consort.
00:39:03.840,00:39:04.950,你聪明机慧,,,
00:39:05.590,00:39:08.000,哀家的话自然一点就透,00:39:04.729,00:39:08.889,You are astute. I need not belabor my point.
00:39:08.930,00:39:11.130,既然说到妾妃之德,00:39:09.819,00:39:12.801,Since you spoke of the duties of a Consort，
00:39:13.100,00:39:15.840,你一定要尊重皇后,00:39:13.919,00:39:17.120,you must respect the Empress.
00:39:17.850,00:39:19.180,皇后待臣妾很好,,,
00:39:19.690,00:39:20.720,臣妾感激不已,00:39:18.999,00:39:20.640,The Empress treats me very kindly.
,,,00:39:20.640,00:39:22.246,I am very grateful towards Her Majesty.
00:39:21.980,00:39:22.890,那就好,00:39:23.180,00:39:24.214,Good.
00:39:25.650,00:39:27.390,你与熹妃情同姐妹,00:39:26.584,00:39:28.718,You and Consort Lumière are like sisters.
00:39:27.740,00:39:29.940,如今熹妃已经有了第二个孩子,00:39:28.718,00:39:31.084,She already bears a second child.
00:39:30.530,00:39:31.740,你还不加紧些吗,00:39:31.464,00:39:33.212,Won't you put in more effort?
00:39:34.330,00:39:35.780,哀家一向看重你,00:39:35.308,00:39:36.680,I've always thought highly of you.
00:39:36.540,00:39:39.070,可你却不肯把心思放在皇帝身上,00:39:37.539,00:39:40.569,But you do not expend enough effort on the Emperor.
00:39:40.500,00:39:43.410,皇帝身边连个规劝的人都没有,00:39:41.400,00:39:44.505,Currently there is no one to properly advise His Majesty ....
00:39:43.880,00:39:45.460,哀家怎么能放心呢,00:39:44.858,00:39:46.438,I constantly worry about this.
00:39:46.460,00:39:48.200,是臣妾知道了,00:39:47.394,00:39:49.134,"I understand, Your Majesty."
00:39:48.760,00:39:51.670,光知道没用要做到才行,00:39:49.427,00:39:52.559,"Understanding is not enough.
You must take action."
00:39:53.180,00:39:54.010,你们两个,,,
00:39:55.010,00:39:58.600,如果能在皇帝身边好好辅佐,00:39:54.069,00:39:59.489,"If you two can serve and assist the Emperor,"
00:39:59.390,00:40:00.930,哀家也就安心了,00:40:00.368,00:40:02.240,then I can put my mind at ease.
00:40:03.730,00:40:05.520,胧月这孩子竟这样疏远我,,,
00:40:06.020,00:40:06.850,真是伤心,00:40:04.930,00:40:07.800,"Longyue is so estranged from me.
It breaks my heart."
00:40:07.150,00:40:09.440,你不必怪敬妃也不用怪胧月,00:40:08.041,00:40:11.041,Don't blame either Consort Estime or Longyue.
00:40:10.400,00:40:12.940,怪只怪皇上不让胧月知道,,,
00:40:13.240,00:40:14.150,有你这个生母,00:40:11.320,00:40:15.320,It was His Majesty who didn't allow Longyue to know.
00:40:15.070,00:40:17.530,两年前有个宫女说漏了嘴,00:40:16.080,00:40:18.730,"Two years ago, a maid accidentally let slip"
00:40:18.290,00:40:20.620,说胧月的生母在甘露寺,00:40:18.760,00:40:22.184,"that Longyue's birth mother was at the
Temple of Pure Dew."
00:40:21.250,00:40:23.360,皇上一怒竟叫打死了,00:40:22.184,00:40:25.134,His Majesty was infuriated and had her flogged to death.
00:40:24.670,00:40:26.280,胧月竟这样舍不得敬妃,00:40:25.648,00:40:27.548,Longyue is very attached to Consort Estime.
00:40:27.000,00:40:27.830,可见这些年,,,
00:40:28.590,00:40:30.200,敬妃真真是待胧月好,00:40:27.934,00:40:31.134,It's clear that Consort Estime has treated her very well.
00:40:31.220,00:40:33.170,方才见她们母女情分这样深,00:40:32.000,00:40:34.370,"When I saw how close they are,"
00:40:34.090,00:40:35.670,即便我强要了胧月回来,,,
00:40:36.260,00:40:37.840,胧月与我也只会更生分,00:40:34.690,00:40:39.040,"I knew that even if I took Longyue back,
it would only drive her further away from me."
00:40:38.680,00:40:40.800,怕也伤了我与敬妃多年的情分,00:40:39.555,00:40:42.040,And would also hurt my relations with Consort Estime.
00:40:41.430,00:40:42.640,你明白就好,,,
00:40:43.020,00:40:43.970,孩子还小嘛,00:40:42.408,00:40:43.998,I'm glad you can see that.
,,,00:40:43.998,00:40:44.978,Longyue is still young.
00:40:44.310,00:40:46.720,你对她好她自然也会对你好,00:40:45.240,00:40:48.600,"If you are good to her, she will warm up to you naturally."
00:40:47.610,00:40:50.140,更何况她总是你亲生的,00:40:48.810,00:40:51.340,"After all, she is your child."
00:40:51.690,00:40:52.230,落轿,,,
00:40:52.700,00:40:53.730,快快快 落轿,00:40:52.668,00:40:53.730,Lower the sedan!
00:40:54.240,00:40:55.150,奴才有罪,00:40:53.900,00:40:55.218,Quick! Lower the sedan!
00:40:56.160,00:40:57.020,奴才有罪,00:40:55.218,00:40:58.098,"We are at fault, Your Highness."
00:40:57.620,00:40:58.980,嬛儿还好吧,,,
00:40:59.620,00:41:00.530,一群糊涂的东西,00:40:58.680,00:41:00.180,"Huan'er, are you all right?"
00:41:00.830,00:41:01.780,娘娘坐在轿子上面,00:41:00.600,00:41:01.730,You idiots!
00:41:02.160,00:41:03.030,做事也这么不当心吗,00:41:01.800,00:41:04.568,"How could you be so careless when
Her Highness is sitting on the sedan!"
00:41:03.410,00:41:04.120,当心我告诉内务府,,,
00:41:04.420,00:41:05.280,砍了你们的狗头,,,
00:41:05.670,00:41:07.450,娘娘恕罪 娘娘恕罪呀,00:41:04.568,00:41:06.870,"You'll have your heads off
if I report this to the Household Department!"
00:41:08.420,00:41:10.250,好好的怎么会摔了一跤,00:41:06.870,00:41:08.883,"Your Highness, please forgive us!"
00:41:10.550,00:41:11.330,都不会走路吗,00:41:09.620,00:41:12.342,"Don't you know how to walk properly?
How could you slip on this road?"
00:41:11.630,00:41:13.710,这这石子路本来是很好的,00:41:12.342,00:41:14.422,This - This stone pavement is usually easy to walk on.
00:41:14.220,00:41:15.800,今天今天不知道怎么,,,
00:41:16.140,00:41:17.090,冒出几块鹅卵石,00:41:15.000,00:41:18.280,"But today there are some pebbles
strewn on the ground,"
00:41:17.930,00:41:19.340,这这奴才才滑了脚啊,00:41:18.520,00:41:20.540,which ... caused us to slip.
00:41:27.480,00:41:28.090,娘娘,00:41:28.600,00:41:29.600,Your Highness.
00:41:32.530,00:41:33.690,你打量着蒙我是吗,,,
00:41:34.400,00:41:35.770,这是回永寿宫最近的路吗,00:41:33.586,00:41:35.056,You think I'm a fool?
00:41:36.320,00:41:37.230,为什么偏走这条路,00:41:35.311,00:41:37.222,"Is this the shortest path back
to Her Highness's palace?"
00:41:37.780,00:41:39.320,奴才们怎么敢蒙姑娘啊,00:41:37.222,00:41:38.652,Why did you take this road?
00:41:39.950,00:41:41.530,这这虽然不是最近的路,00:41:38.720,00:41:40.520,"We dare not fool you, miss."
00:41:41.870,00:41:43.780,这可是夏天最凉爽的路啊,00:41:40.640,00:41:42.800,"Although this is not the shortest path,"
00:41:44.370,00:41:45.360,幸好娘娘没事,00:41:43.000,00:41:45.021,it is the coolest path in summer.
00:41:45.750,00:41:46.950,要是有点什么闪失,00:41:45.200,00:41:46.600,"Thankfully, Her Highness is not hurt."
00:41:47.330,00:41:48.410,那奴才们就算有一百个头,00:41:46.600,00:41:48.150,"If anything happened to Her Highness,"
00:41:48.750,00:41:49.710,也不够砍哪,00:41:48.200,00:41:51.069,"our heads would not be enough to
compensate for our offense."
00:41:50.800,00:41:51.660,这是什么地方,00:41:51.778,00:41:52.984,Where are we right now?
00:41:52.710,00:41:55.500,再往前走就是祺嫔的储秀宫了,00:41:53.480,00:41:56.700,"Concubine Délice's Palace of Gathering Excellence
is just steps ahead."
00:41:56.050,00:41:58.380,一般来说若无特别的盼咐,00:41:57.028,00:41:59.644,"Usually, if there are no special orders,"
00:41:58.720,00:42:01.010,都是怎么来的就按原路回去,00:41:59.644,00:42:02.134,the porters would go back on the same route.
00:42:01.510,00:42:02.300,今儿天热,,,
00:42:02.720,00:42:05.310,他们走了这条路也是必然之理,00:42:02.488,00:42:06.258,"Since it is quite hot today, of course they chose this path."
00:42:06.230,00:42:09.440,看来是有人存心了,00:42:07.164,00:42:10.374,It seems that someone had their heart set on them stumbling.
00:42:12.230,00:42:13.640,我才回宫第二天,00:42:13.208,00:42:15.026,This is only the second day since my return
00:42:15.240,00:42:16.980,便已经有人等不及了,00:42:16.129,00:42:18.609,and somebody is already feeling impatient.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.200,00:43:00.200,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.200,00:43:20.200,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.200,00:43:37.200,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.200,00:43:55.200,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.200,00:44:03.200,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.200,00:44:15.200,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.200,00:44:34.200,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
