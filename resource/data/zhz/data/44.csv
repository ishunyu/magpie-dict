00:08:37.970,00:08:39.340,皇上臣有急事禀报,00:08:38.592,00:08:40.440,"Your Majesty, I must report this emergency."
00:08:40.180,00:08:40.840,说吧,,,
00:08:41.060,00:08:41.640,皇上,00:08:41.139,00:08:41.840,Go on.
00:08:41.850,00:08:43.180,方才碎玉轩里的人要闯出宫门,00:08:41.840,00:08:44.541,"Your Majesty, servants in the Palace of
Pearl Jade attempted to pass the guards."
00:08:43.520,00:08:44.350,侍卫们忠于职守,,,
00:08:44.600,00:08:46.090,纠缠中一位宫女被碰伤,00:08:44.811,00:08:47.444,"The guards held their positions.
But one maid was injured in the conflict."
00:08:46.600,00:08:50.100,他们竟然如此大胆敢强闯宫门,00:08:47.844,00:08:51.440,"They are very bold even to have dared
to challenge the guards."
00:08:51.030,00:08:51.890,知道为什么吗,,,
00:08:52.610,00:08:53.270,回皇上,00:08:51.890,00:08:53.760,Do you know why they did so?
00:08:53.490,00:08:55.650,听侍卫们说是莞嫔娘娘昏倒了,00:08:54.010,00:08:57.026,"Your Majesty, the guards reported that
it was because Her Highness fainted,"
00:08:55.990,00:08:57.570,他们的人要出门请太医,,,
00:08:57.990,00:08:59.030,侍卫们谨遵旨意,00:08:57.277,00:08:59.120,and the servants wanted to bring a doctor.
00:08:59.280,00:09:00.490,不让他们出去就,00:08:59.257,00:09:01.400,"The guards blocked their way

00:09:00.660,00:09:01.400,大胆,,,
00:09:03.960,00:09:05.570,朕只是吩咐禁足,00:09:01.400,00:09:03.065,How dare you!
00:09:06.120,00:09:07.990,你们竟然不许莞嫔就医,00:09:05.115,00:09:06.991,I have only ordered confinement.
00:09:08.330,00:09:10.070,莞嫔要是有个三长两短,00:09:07.257,00:09:09.280,"But you dared to prevent
Concubine Sourire from seeing a doctor!"
00:09:10.550,00:09:11.380,你们担待得了吗,00:09:09.510,00:09:11.324,"If anything happens to her,"
00:09:11.710,00:09:12.580,奴才罪该万死,00:09:11.590,00:09:12.767,can you bear the consequences?
00:09:12.960,00:09:15.170,让领班的侍卫到慎刑司领罚去,00:09:12.767,00:09:14.120,My guilt deserves a thousand deaths.
00:09:15.430,00:09:16.010,嗻,00:09:14.170,00:09:16.487,"The leader of the guards will seek his
punishment from the Department of Penalty."
00:09:18.680,00:09:19.260,苏培盛,00:09:16.709,00:09:17.280,Yes.

00:09:20.560,00:09:22.640,马上宣太医去给莞嫔救治,00:09:21.253,00:09:23.831,"Immediately, send doctors for Concubine Sourire."

00:09:35.700,00:09:36.480,小主醒了,00:09:36.884,00:09:38.557,My Lady is awake.
00:09:37.610,00:09:40.570,别动 这手上刚涂了治冻疮的药,00:09:38.868,00:09:41.769,Don't move. There is chilblain medicine on your hands.
00:09:41.160,00:09:42.240,要好生养着,00:09:42.240,00:09:43.808,It will take time to recover.

00:09:46.620,00:09:47.610,来 送过来,00:09:46.115,00:09:47.259,You must be hungry.
00:09:49.130,00:09:50.410,温太医特意嘱咐了,00:09:47.610,00:09:48.716,Bring it here.
00:09:50.710,00:09:52.450,让人用东阿阿胶炖的燕窝,00:09:50.000,00:09:53.351,"Dr. Wen specially ordered the bird's nest
to be made with ejiao."
00:09:53.210,00:09:54.580,小主快趁热喝了吧,00:09:54.320,00:09:56.134,"My Lady, you should have some while it's warm."
00:09:59.390,00:10:00.250,温大人,00:10:00.544,00:10:01.803,Dr. Wen.
00:10:01.260,00:10:04.350,娘娘 微臣恭喜娘娘,00:10:02.248,00:10:03.429,Your Highness.
,,,00:10:03.840,00:10:05.827,I congratulate Your Highness.
00:10:05.430,00:10:06.390,恭喜娘娘,00:10:06.626,00:10:07.920,"Congratulations, Your Highness!"
00:10:07.600,00:10:09.640,娘娘温大人说,00:10:08.799,00:10:09.711,"Your Highness,"
00:10:10.110,00:10:11.970,您已经有一个月的身孕了,00:10:09.711,00:10:13.111,Dr. Wen said that you have been pregnant for one month.
00:10:17.320,00:10:18.060,槿汐,00:10:18.519,00:10:20.000,"- Jinxi.
- Aye."
00:10:19.860,00:10:21.320,你和温太医留下,00:10:20.768,00:10:22.474,You and Dr. Wen will stay.
00:10:22.490,00:10:23.780,其他人都退下吧,00:10:23.600,00:10:25.120,Others may leave.
00:10:31.670,00:10:34.500,娘娘 微臣刚刚给您把过脉,00:10:32.780,00:10:36.160,"Your Highness, I have just taken your pulse."
00:10:35.460,00:10:38.210,您心情起伏太大 胎气有些不稳,00:10:36.498,00:10:39.320,"Your emotions have been changing
radically that your prenatal qi is unstable."
00:10:38.470,00:10:40.130,切不可以再动气伤身了,00:10:39.631,00:10:41.760,You must avoid such harm to your health.
00:10:41.090,00:10:44.550,大人以为本宫眼下如何,00:10:42.217,00:10:43.381,"Dr. Wen,"
00:10:45.010,00:10:47.850,眼下是娘娘翻身的唯一时机,00:10:44.225,00:10:45.970,what is your assessment of my situation now?
00:10:48.770,00:10:50.980,皇上已经知道了娘娘怀孕的消息,00:10:46.148,00:10:49.182,"Now is the only chance for Your Highness
to turn the situation around."
00:10:51.560,00:10:53.270,下旨由微臣来照顾娘娘,00:10:50.000,00:10:52.686,His Majesty has been informed of your pregnancy
00:10:54.230,00:10:55.190,皇后也下令,00:10:52.864,00:10:54.880,and ordered that I will take care of Your Highness.
00:10:55.440,00:10:57.730,要对娘娘的饮食起居格外地照顾,00:10:55.446,00:10:58.922,"The Empress also commands extra care
for Your Highness's food and supplies."
00:10:58.700,00:11:01.030,娘娘您尽可以安心了,00:10:59.677,00:11:02.362,Your Highness can rest assured of your situation.
00:11:02.490,00:11:03.200,是吗,00:11:03.600,00:11:04.712,Can I?
00:11:04.490,00:11:05.530,大人以为,00:11:05.530,00:11:06.792,Do you think
00:11:06.660,00:11:08.570,这是本宫翻身的机会吗,00:11:07.548,00:11:10.293,that this is my chance to turn the situation around?
00:11:10.120,00:11:10.950,若如此,00:11:11.141,00:11:12.360,"If so,"
00:11:12.500,00:11:14.870,大人方才絮絮说了这么多,00:11:13.610,00:11:16.335,"in all the orders you have mentioned,"
00:11:16.550,00:11:19.540,怎未曾听提及有解除禁足之令,00:11:17.838,00:11:20.917,why haven't I heard of the order to rescind my confinement?
00:11:21.130,00:11:23.250,皇上也没有一字的安慰之语,00:11:22.240,00:11:24.626,Nor has His Majesty sent any words of comfort.
00:11:25.560,00:11:27.420,何况这所谓的照顾,00:11:26.625,00:11:28.663,The so-called care for me—
00:11:29.020,00:11:30.880,也是为了本宫的孩子,00:11:30.178,00:11:32.393,"it's only for my child,"
00:11:32.520,00:11:33.850,并非为了本宫,00:11:33.541,00:11:35.040,not for me.
00:11:35.400,00:11:36.060,娘娘,00:11:36.377,00:11:37.570,Your Highness.
00:11:38.320,00:11:39.270,你放心,00:11:39.270,00:11:40.800,Don't worry.
00:11:40.610,00:11:45.700,本宫到任何时候都不会自轻自贱,00:11:41.688,00:11:43.422,"In any case,"
00:11:46.700,00:11:47.860,委屈了这孩子,00:11:45.065,00:11:47.366,I will not belittle my own life
00:11:49.000,00:11:49.650,那就好,00:11:47.943,00:11:49.458,or let my child suffer.
00:11:50.410,00:11:51.400,微臣和惠贵人,00:11:50.000,00:11:51.400,I am reassured.
00:11:51.620,00:11:53.330,都生怕娘娘会委屈了自己,00:11:51.400,00:11:53.440,Noble Lady Vertu and I were worried
00:11:54.290,00:11:55.250,有娘娘这句话,00:11:53.440,00:11:55.150,that Your Highness might compromise your health.
,,,00:11:55.549,00:11:57.026,"As Your Highness says so,"
00:11:55.880,00:11:58.240,微臣一定竭尽全力照顾好娘娘,00:11:57.026,00:11:59.395,I will do my best to take care of Your Highness.
00:11:58.920,00:12:00.880,大人与本宫相识多年,00:12:00.000,00:12:02.093,You have known me for a long time.
00:12:02.090,00:12:04.300,何曾见过本宫自轻自贱,00:12:03.067,00:12:05.632,Have you seen me ever depreciating myself?
00:12:06.220,00:12:09.680,本宫只知道自己和腹中胎儿,00:12:07.285,00:12:08.800,I entrust
00:12:10.680,00:12:11.970,都托付给大人了,00:12:09.206,00:12:11.445,the safety of me and the baby in my belly
00:12:13.020,00:12:13.800,放心吧,00:12:11.667,00:12:13.242,"to you, Dr. Wen."
00:12:14.730,00:12:16.440,微臣一定会尽心竭力,00:12:14.041,00:12:15.709,I assure Your Highness
00:12:16.690,00:12:18.770,照顾好娘娘和腹中的胎儿,00:12:15.709,00:12:19.810,"that I will take the best care of Your Highness
and your baby with all my abilities."
00:12:19.230,00:12:20.640,这不仅仅是为了娘娘,,,
00:12:21.240,00:12:22.350,更是为了惠贵人,00:12:20.400,00:12:22.032,"This is not for Your Highness,"
00:12:22.820,00:12:24.280,对娘娘的一番心意,00:12:22.298,00:12:25.870,but also for the care and concern that Lady Vertu has for Your Highness.
00:12:25.870,00:12:27.700,本宫禁足这些日子,00:12:26.669,00:12:28.988,Meizhuang must be very worried
00:12:29.200,00:12:30.610,姐姐担心坏了,00:12:30.364,00:12:32.553,all these days while I have been confined.
00:12:32.000,00:12:34.830,是啊 夜不安寝 食不知味,00:12:32.731,00:12:34.240,It's true.
00:12:35.880,00:12:37.990,无论是从景仁宫还是到养心殿,00:12:34.347,00:12:36.162,She could neither sleep nor eat well.
00:12:38.420,00:12:39.500,都被拒之门外,00:12:36.784,00:12:40.480,"Their Majesties both refused her
outside their palace gates."
00:12:40.260,00:12:42.460,贵人她心急如焚哪,00:12:41.370,00:12:43.925,She had her heart burning in anxiety.
00:12:43.010,00:12:46.090,叫姐姐放心本宫没事,00:12:44.147,00:12:46.134,Tell Meizhuang not to worry about me.
00:12:47.010,00:12:47.750,微臣明白,00:12:46.356,00:12:47.840,I am all right.
00:12:48.720,00:12:49.960,娘娘您安心养胎,00:12:47.972,00:12:49.156,I will.
00:12:50.430,00:12:51.390,微臣先告退了,00:12:49.600,00:12:51.760,"Your Highness should devote a
peaceful mind to the baby."
,,,00:12:51.807,00:12:53.033,I shall take my leave.
00:12:58.820,00:12:59.770,槿汐,00:13:00.000,00:13:01.083,Jinxi.
00:13:03.240,00:13:04.820,这个时候有了孩子也好,00:13:04.349,00:13:06.599,Being pregnant is good news.
00:13:05.490,00:13:08.320,想必皇上也不会那么绝情了,00:13:06.599,00:13:09.298,I believe His Majesty will stop being so hardhearted.
00:13:10.080,00:13:12.110,也幸好是温太医照应娘娘,00:13:11.019,00:13:13.490,"It's fortunate that Your Highness
will be attended by Dr. Wen."
00:13:12.620,00:13:13.990,奴婢也更放心些,00:13:13.668,00:13:15.185,I trust him.
00:13:15.000,00:13:16.910,你也觉得皇上太绝情了吗,00:13:15.807,00:13:18.551,"Do you also feel that His Majesty
is too hardhearted?"
00:13:20.380,00:13:24.170,这宫中的孩子那么多都生不下来,00:13:21.401,00:13:23.341,Many children in the palace
,,,00:13:23.741,00:13:25.680,died before they were born.
00:13:24.800,00:13:27.840,可见往后将步步都是险路,00:13:25.777,00:13:29.023,Each step ahead of us will not be easy.
00:13:28.890,00:13:31.380,娘娘今后要小心为好啊,00:13:30.000,00:13:32.623,Your Highness has to be very cautious.
00:13:32.810,00:13:36.550,槿汐 拿笔墨来,00:13:33.609,00:13:34.861,"Jinxi,"
00:13:38.100,00:13:39.470,娘娘身子虚弱,00:13:36.837,00:13:38.482,bring me the ink brush.
00:13:39.860,00:13:42.060,有什么等好些了再写吧,00:13:39.415,00:13:40.669,Your Highness is still weak.
00:13:42.480,00:13:43.270,你去拿吧,00:13:40.891,00:13:43.702,"If you need to write something,
please wait until you are better."
00:13:44.440,00:13:45.150,好,00:13:43.702,00:13:44.912,Please bring it.
,,,00:13:45.639,00:13:46.837,Yes.
00:14:09.090,00:14:10.460,如今我有了身孕,00:14:10.000,00:14:11.814,"Now that I'm pregnant,"
00:14:11.100,00:14:12.960,皇上必定肯看我的书信,00:14:12.214,00:14:14.337,His Majesty will not refuse to read my letter.
00:14:13.930,00:14:15.970,你想办法送到御前,00:14:14.951,00:14:17.213,Try to send this to His Majesty.
00:14:17.060,00:14:18.850,娘娘写了什么,00:14:18.214,00:14:20.004,What has Your Highness written?
00:14:19.230,00:14:20.590,我求皇上下旨,00:14:20.590,00:14:22.330,I plead with His Majesty
00:14:21.480,00:14:25.190,由皇后亲自照料我怀孕生产之事,00:14:22.596,00:14:26.300,to put the Empress in charge of my prenatal care.
00:14:25.650,00:14:26.360,皇后,,,
00:14:27.450,00:14:28.560,娘娘不是一直疑心,00:14:26.773,00:14:28.193,The Empress?
00:14:28.820,00:14:30.650,今番之事都是皇后指使的吗,00:14:28.593,00:14:31.820,"Doesn't Your Highness suspect that
she was behind what happened to you?"
00:14:31.030,00:14:32.770,怎么还要皇后亲自照顾呢,00:14:32.095,00:14:34.120,Why do you ask for her supervision?
00:14:33.120,00:14:35.230,正因为如今宫中皇后独大,00:14:34.190,00:14:36.765,No one in the harem now can balance with her power.
00:14:36.080,00:14:37.290,我要留心这孩子,,,
00:14:37.870,00:14:39.660,凭我一己之力必然不够,00:14:37.234,00:14:41.020,I can't solely depend on myself to protect my child.
00:14:41.330,00:14:43.170,皇后如此设计陷害我,00:14:42.218,00:14:44.434,"Since she has plotted against me,"
00:14:43.960,00:14:45.290,必定十分厌恶我,00:14:45.100,00:14:47.319,she must resent me deeply
00:14:46.260,00:14:48.290,必然也会厌恶我腹中的孩子,00:14:47.497,00:14:49.470,and will also detest my child.
00:14:49.470,00:14:51.830,我要她一应照顾我怀孕生产之事,00:14:50.402,00:14:53.028,"Now, I want her to take charge of my prenatal care."
00:14:52.550,00:14:53.710,若有任何差池,,,
00:14:54.180,00:14:56.140,她首当其冲脱不了干系,00:14:53.517,00:14:55.131,"If anything went amiss,"
00:14:57.520,00:14:58.930,她必然会竭尽全力,00:14:55.397,00:14:57.520,she would be the first one to blame.
00:14:59.520,00:15:00.880,来保住我这个孩子,00:14:58.541,00:15:00.662,"Therefore, she must exert all her means"
00:15:03.270,00:15:04.480,要想一切平安,00:15:00.880,00:15:02.519,to ensure my child is safely born.
00:15:04.820,00:15:06.430,这倒是个最好的法子了,00:15:04.380,00:15:07.776,This seems the best way to ensure safety for now.
00:15:07.740,00:15:09.820,娘娘若想将来复宠,00:15:08.672,00:15:11.063,"If Your Highness wants to regain favor,"
00:15:10.490,00:15:13.030,一切指望就在这个孩子身上了,00:15:11.507,00:15:13.918,it will all depend on this child.
00:15:14.490,00:15:18.280,我只希望这个孩子能够平安长大,00:15:15.555,00:15:19.345,I only hope my child can grow up safe and sound.
00:15:21.170,00:15:21.900,拿下去吧,00:15:22.147,00:15:23.632,Take this.
00:15:24.840,00:15:26.330,那燕窝怕是已经凉了,00:15:25.328,00:15:27.706,I'm afraid the bird's nest has already turned cold.
00:15:26.920,00:15:29.040,奴婢去兑些牛乳来吧,00:15:27.972,00:15:30.355,I will mix it with some warm milk.
00:15:29.880,00:15:31.090,你等下再去弄吧,00:15:30.888,00:15:32.930,You can do it later.
00:15:32.930,00:15:34.920,我嘴里总觉得淡淡的没味道,00:15:33.996,00:15:36.518,I've been craving something with stronger flavours.
00:15:35.850,00:15:37.550,你让流朱盼咐小厨房,,,
00:15:37.850,00:15:39.010,去做碗虾仁粥来,00:15:36.873,00:15:40.240,"Ask Vermillion to prepare some
shrimp congee in the kitchen."
00:15:52.570,00:15:55.560,隔了这些日子心静些了吗,00:15:53.329,00:15:56.670,"Have you been able to calm your mind
after these days?"
00:15:56.910,00:15:57.990,静不下来,00:15:58.001,00:16:00.000,I haven't been unable to.
00:15:58.490,00:16:01.450,碎玉轩的消息天天地听在耳边,00:16:00.000,00:16:02.959,"I keep hearing news from the Palace of Pearl Jade,"
00:16:02.120,00:16:05.330,可是想走近些去看看都不能,00:16:03.137,00:16:06.536,but I cannot even go near for a visit.
00:16:06.000,00:16:07.870,可知皇帝生了大气,00:16:07.246,00:16:09.378,You can tell the Emperor is indeed furious.
00:16:09.460,00:16:10.830,所以哀家劝你,,,
00:16:11.220,00:16:13.500,别赶在风口浪尖上去劝,00:16:10.533,00:16:12.540,So I caution you
00:16:13.720,00:16:14.800,越是风口浪尖,00:16:12.540,00:16:14.787,"not to stand up at the ""teeth of the storm""."
00:16:15.220,00:16:17.180,莞嫔的日子就越难过,00:16:14.787,00:16:18.485,"It is at the ""teeth of the storm"" that
Concubine Sourire is having her hardest time."
00:16:18.850,00:16:22.340,这个时候莞嫔的日子是该难过,00:16:20.000,00:16:23.405,"At this juncture, Concubine Sourire
should be having a hard time."
00:16:22.940,00:16:24.220,难过是应该的,,,
00:16:24.980,00:16:25.970,如果这个时候,00:16:24.027,00:16:25.591,This is only normal.
00:16:26.190,00:16:28.400,皇帝还能心平气和地待她,00:16:26.080,00:16:29.301,"If the Emperor could still treat her as usual,"
00:16:29.030,00:16:30.860,哀家才觉得担心呢,00:16:30.000,00:16:32.209,then I should be concerned.
00:16:31.280,00:16:34.240,可是莞嫔只是穿错了一件衣裳,00:16:32.387,00:16:35.217,"But Concubine Sourire was
only wearing a wrong robe."
00:16:34.530,00:16:36.440,皇上何至于要如此,00:16:35.661,00:16:37.949,Why would His Majesty be like this?
00:16:37.580,00:16:38.910,哀家虽不过问,00:16:38.571,00:16:40.360,"Although I never asked,"
00:16:39.620,00:16:41.530,但一定还有其他的原因,00:16:40.819,00:16:42.960,I believe there are other reasons.
00:16:45.250,00:16:47.790,臣妾恳请太后一定要救一救莞嫔,00:16:46.537,00:16:49.077,I implore Your Majesty to save Concubine Sourire.
00:16:48.960,00:16:50.420,现在还不是时候,00:16:50.000,00:16:51.760,Now is not the right time.
00:16:51.130,00:16:52.670,哀家不能答应你,00:16:51.883,00:16:53.360,I cannot agree to this.
00:16:53.050,00:16:53.710,太后,,,
00:16:53.970,00:16:55.000,你不明白,00:16:54.275,00:16:55.040,Your Majesty...
00:16:55.260,00:16:57.170,一定要让皇帝出了这口气,00:16:55.040,00:16:56.240,You don't understand.
00:16:57.760,00:16:58.880,怒火平息,00:16:56.643,00:16:58.160,The Emperor needs to vent out all his anger.
00:16:59.470,00:17:02.010,莞嫔才会有机会再得到宠爱,00:16:58.760,00:17:00.360,"When his anger is calmed,"
00:17:03.060,00:17:04.390,否则就算出来,00:17:00.713,00:17:03.653,"Concubine Sourire can then have
a chance to regain favor."
00:17:04.940,00:17:07.100,你以为莞嫔以后有好日子过吗,00:17:04.160,00:17:06.280,"Or else even when her confinement ends,"
,,,00:17:06.280,00:17:08.387,do you think her life will be any easier?
00:17:08.730,00:17:11.970,何况这件事牵涉到纯元皇后,00:17:09.618,00:17:12.858,This incident concerns Empress Première.
00:17:13.400,00:17:16.940,皇帝若不松口 谁也劝不了,00:17:14.190,00:17:18.545,"If the Emperor does not change
his own mind, no one else can."
00:17:28.130,00:17:28.860,小主,00:17:29.094,00:17:30.489,My Lady.
00:17:35.420,00:17:37.160,小主现在是有身子的人了,00:17:36.427,00:17:38.210,You are now pregnant.
00:17:37.550,00:17:38.710,一人吃 两人补,,,
00:17:39.140,00:17:40.300,要多喝一点才好,00:17:38.654,00:17:40.444,The food you eat will nourish for two.
00:17:42.850,00:17:43.630,流朱呢,00:17:40.444,00:17:42.061,Please try to eat more.
00:17:44.850,00:17:46.430,刚才你们进来贺喜时,00:17:43.995,00:17:45.575,Where is Vermillion?
00:17:46.730,00:17:47.680,也没有看见她,00:17:45.841,00:17:48.746,I didn't see her when you all were here.
00:17:50.360,00:17:52.850,小主是嫌奴婢伺候得不够好吗,00:17:51.381,00:17:53.960,"My Lady, are you unsatisfied with my service?"
00:17:53.570,00:17:55.400,怎么一心想着流朱啊,00:17:54.626,00:17:56.490,You keep asking about Vermillion.
00:17:56.490,00:17:57.100,流朱呢,,,
00:17:57.740,00:17:58.480,没有怎么,00:17:57.518,00:17:58.990,Where is Vermillion?
,,,00:17:58.990,00:18:00.520,Don't worry.
00:17:59.070,00:18:03.320,只是流朱她这两日没有休息好,00:18:00.565,00:18:02.065,Vermillion has not ...
00:18:04.000,00:18:05.990,闹了风寒正睡着呢,00:18:02.800,00:18:04.440,rested well these two days.
00:18:06.790,00:18:07.530,我去瞧瞧她,00:18:05.045,00:18:07.188,She caught a cold and is sleeping now.
00:18:07.830,00:18:08.490,小主,00:18:07.400,00:18:08.862,I will go check on her.
00:18:11.250,00:18:12.370,流朱她刚睡下,00:18:08.862,00:18:09.502,My Lady.
00:18:13.630,00:18:14.620,你也才刚醒,00:18:12.340,00:18:14.120,"Vermillion has just gone to sleep,"
00:18:15.510,00:18:17.120,不如晚一点再去看好吗,00:18:14.620,00:18:16.452,and you have also just woken up.
00:18:18.760,00:18:20.970,你别拦着我我去看看,00:18:16.632,00:18:18.360,Why not check on her later?
00:18:21.140,00:18:21.840,小主,00:18:20.000,00:18:22.285,Don't stop me. I will go check ...
00:18:23.310,00:18:24.390,小主不用去了,00:18:22.285,00:18:23.721,My Lady.
,,,00:18:24.298,00:18:26.129,There is no need to go.
00:18:26.350,00:18:27.180,流朱她,00:18:27.339,00:18:28.771,Vermillion ...
00:18:30.560,00:18:32.850,她 她已经不在了,00:18:32.235,00:18:34.422,She is no longer with us.
00:18:35.990,00:18:36.770,你说什么,00:18:37.214,00:18:38.360,What did you say ?
00:18:38.360,00:18:40.690,小主以为温太医是如何进来的,00:18:39.360,00:18:41.880,How do you think we managed to bring in Dr. Wen?
00:18:42.530,00:18:44.820,外头的人根本就不听我们的求告,00:18:43.373,00:18:46.640,The guards outside ignored all our pleas.
00:18:46.910,00:18:51.120,是流朱拼死撞到了刀上,00:18:47.709,00:18:49.101,Vermillion ...
00:18:52.920,00:18:54.580,外头的人怕出了性命,00:18:50.388,00:18:53.606,confronted their swords ...
00:18:54.920,00:18:55.910,才叫温太医来,00:18:54.183,00:18:58.220,"and the guards called in doctors
fearing that casualties would be involved."
00:18:57.340,00:18:59.000,幸好来的是温太医,00:18:58.406,00:19:00.200,It was fortunate that Dr. Wen was sent.
00:19:00.180,00:19:01.130,但是流朱,00:19:01.689,00:19:03.200,But Vermillion ...
00:19:03.140,00:19:05.050,她已经不在了,00:19:04.258,00:19:06.590,had lost her life.
00:19:08.930,00:19:10.300,浣碧你,00:19:10.000,00:19:11.480,Jade! You...
00:19:11.900,00:19:13.980,我早就说不让小主知道,00:19:12.955,00:19:15.131,I agreed not to tell My Lady ...
00:19:14.820,00:19:16.150,怕伤了胎气,00:19:15.930,00:19:17.793,in case this affects her pregnancy.
00:19:19.820,00:19:21.730,娘娘 奴婢知道你难过,00:19:21.000,00:19:22.258,Your Highness ...
00:19:22.910,00:19:24.900,可是娘娘再难过也要明白,00:19:22.258,00:19:23.680,"I know you feel deep grief,"
,,,00:19:24.115,00:19:26.602,"but no matter how much grief Your Highness feels,"
00:19:25.620,00:19:28.530,眼下最要紧的是要保全自己,00:19:26.780,00:19:30.415,"you have to put your own well-being
above all else in the current circumstance."
00:19:30.410,00:19:34.080,流朱姑娘是为娘娘而死,00:19:31.387,00:19:35.057,Vermillion died for Your Highness...
00:19:35.090,00:19:37.620,娘娘不能让流朱姑娘白死才是啊,00:19:36.289,00:19:39.400,Your Highness must not let her life be lost in vain!
00:19:41.470,00:19:42.710,娘娘只有自己周全了,,,
00:19:43.010,00:19:45.220,才有可能为流朱姑娘报仇啊,00:19:42.710,00:19:44.660,Only when Your Highness is well and good
,,,00:19:44.660,00:19:46.640,can you then avenge Vermillion's death.
00:19:49.600,00:19:51.720,流朱自小和我一同长大,00:19:50.843,00:19:53.040,Vermillion grew up with me ...
00:19:54.650,00:19:56.850,如同自己的亲妹妹,00:19:55.893,00:19:58.093,She is like my sister by blood.
00:19:58.650,00:19:59.730,小主娘娘,,,
00:20:00.320,00:20:01.930,不要啊 小主不要啊,00:19:59.360,00:20:01.618,"- My Lady!
- Please don't, My Lady!"
00:20:02.240,00:20:04.100,娘娘的手是刚包过的娘娘,00:20:02.720,00:20:05.246,"Your Highness, your hands were just wrapped."
00:20:05.490,00:20:06.900,这么砸 可怎么好,00:20:06.200,00:20:08.276,You would hurt yourself beating them like this!
00:20:08.870,00:20:11.030,娘娘忘了当日淳小主的死了吗,00:20:10.202,00:20:12.600,Did Your Highness forget the death of Lady Chun?
00:20:12.120,00:20:13.240,当时可以忍,,,
00:20:13.870,00:20:16.240,眼下为什么不能忍一时之痛呢,00:20:13.162,00:20:17.990,"If you could endure then, why can't we
also endure the pain just for now?"
00:20:17.960,00:20:19.250,娘娘若伤了自己,00:20:19.256,00:20:21.240,"Should Your Highness hurt yourself,"
00:20:20.460,00:20:22.750,将来若是想为流朱姑娘报仇,00:20:21.894,00:20:24.063,you would only be powerless
00:20:24.140,00:20:25.720,也是有心无力呀,00:20:25.128,00:20:27.367,to avenge Vermillion in the future.
00:20:27.220,00:20:28.300,是啊,00:20:28.590,00:20:30.000,Right.
00:20:29.890,00:20:31.550,我只有好好活着,00:20:31.120,00:20:33.318,I must live on my life
00:20:33.350,00:20:35.220,流朱才不算枉死,00:20:34.428,00:20:38.087,so her death isn't in vain.

00:20:55.620,00:20:56.960,皇额娘万福金安,00:20:56.666,00:20:58.760,Peace and grace to Imperial Mother.
00:20:58.840,00:20:59.450,起来吧,,,
00:20:59.920,00:21:00.530,是,00:20:59.720,00:21:00.720,Rise.
,,,00:21:00.942,00:21:01.960,Yes.
00:21:02.170,00:21:04.460,哀家安不安也就这样了,00:21:03.133,00:21:05.521,My peace is not of concern.
00:21:05.590,00:21:08.510,皇帝的孩子安不安才让哀家挂心,00:21:06.742,00:21:09.622,My concern is the peace of the imperial heir.
00:21:09.760,00:21:12.430,皇额娘所指的是莞嫔的胎吗,00:21:10.992,00:21:14.034,"Do you mean Concubine Sourire's
pregnancy, Imperial Mother?"
00:21:14.730,00:21:15.840,听皇帝说,00:21:15.790,00:21:17.723,The Emperor told me
00:21:16.850,00:21:19.140,莞嫔希望你来保她这一胎,00:21:18.034,00:21:20.843,"that Concubine Sourire wants you to be
in charge of her prenatal care."
00:21:20.940,00:21:22.310,臣妾何德何能,,,
00:21:22.740,00:21:24.980,连自己的大阿哥也保不住啊,00:21:22.078,00:21:24.132,I'm afraid I am incapable.
,,,00:21:24.132,00:21:26.391,I failed to save my First Prince ...
00:21:25.240,00:21:28.600,你保得住 这一点哀家信,00:21:26.391,00:21:27.819,You are capable.
,,,00:21:27.977,00:21:30.237,"That, I have faith in you."
00:21:33.500,00:21:34.950,既然皇额娘这样盼咐,00:21:34.480,00:21:36.728,"Since it's your order, Imperial Mother,"
00:21:35.540,00:21:36.900,臣妾不敢推辞,00:21:36.728,00:21:38.273,I must not decline.
00:21:37.670,00:21:40.530,照看六宫妃嫔本是皇后的职责,00:21:38.800,00:21:41.738,It is my duty to look after all the concubines.
00:21:42.800,00:21:45.080,你能知道自己的职责就好,00:21:43.758,00:21:46.200,It's good that you know your duties.
00:21:46.340,00:21:49.000,身在其位想要站得稳,00:21:47.260,00:21:50.240,"If you wish to secure your status,"
00:21:49.850,00:21:52.430,必须刚柔共济 张弛有度,00:21:50.880,00:21:53.738,you need to complement strength with gentleness.
00:21:53.770,00:21:55.510,你是大清的皇后,00:21:54.720,00:21:56.658,You are an empress of the Great Qing
00:21:55.730,00:21:57.590,也是乌拉那拉氏的皇后,00:21:56.658,00:21:58.797,and also an empress from the Ula-Nara clan.
00:21:58.310,00:22:01.650,你的一举一动除了世人瞩目,00:21:59.200,00:22:02.620,"Each act and every move of yours
not only draws attention from all"
00:22:02.020,00:22:03.760,更关系到一门荣辱,00:22:03.293,00:22:05.551,but also relates to the honor of the entire clan.
00:22:05.440,00:22:07.310,你是哀家的表侄女,00:22:06.518,00:22:08.778,You are my niece [cousin's daughter ].
00:22:07.910,00:22:10.820,哀家希望你能保住皇后的荣耀,00:22:09.060,00:22:12.160,I hope you can preserve the glory of an empress
00:22:11.410,00:22:14.120,保住乌拉那拉氏满门的荣耀,00:22:12.460,00:22:15.180,and the glory of the Ula-Naras.
00:22:16.370,00:22:17.110,是,00:22:17.593,00:22:18.833,Yes.
00:22:19.170,00:22:23.000,好好保着别人 也是保着自己呀,00:22:20.198,00:22:24.280,Peace to others also means peace to yourself.
00:22:28.010,00:22:30.220,你难得肯自己来见朕,00:22:29.292,00:22:31.840,It's rare that you would come to see me.
00:22:31.220,00:22:33.460,臣妾病愈后身子一直虚弱,00:22:32.160,00:22:34.680,"I have been feeling weak since
my recovery from the plague."
00:22:33.930,00:22:36.840,未能侍奉皇上 还请皇上见谅,00:22:34.860,00:22:37.840,"I could not serve Your Majesty and
I hope Your Majesty will pardon me."
00:22:37.940,00:22:40.680,你急着来见朕不是为了说这个吧,00:22:38.993,00:22:41.880,You didn't rush here just to say this.
00:22:43.820,00:22:46.560,莞嫔有孕 恳请皇上宽恕莞嫔,00:22:44.797,00:22:47.700,"Concubine Sourire is pregnant.
I beg Your Majesty to forgive her."
00:22:46.780,00:22:49.770,朕愿意见你不是想听你说这个,00:22:47.878,00:22:50.838,I didn't let you come in to say this to me.
00:22:50.030,00:22:51.440,皇上既愿意见臣妾,,,
00:22:51.700,00:22:53.660,就知道臣妾一定会说这个,00:22:51.198,00:22:54.600,"Your Majesty agreed to see me, so you
knew I would certainly bring this up."
00:22:53.910,00:22:56.070,你说你的 听不听由朕,00:22:54.820,00:22:57.360,"Go on and say what you want,
but it's my decision whether to listen."
00:22:56.450,00:22:58.440,臣妾乞求皇上顾念龙胎,00:22:57.656,00:23:00.316,I beg Your Majesty to pity the imperial heir.
00:22:59.330,00:23:02.370,如今莞嫔心神哀戚 衣食不保,,,
00:23:02.630,00:23:04.290,又怎能够安心养胎,00:23:00.542,00:23:05.342,"How can Concubine Sourire's baby rest
well when she's in sorrow and privation?"
00:23:05.050,00:23:07.130,朕已经处置了苟总管,00:23:06.158,00:23:08.440,I've already punished Chief Gou.
00:23:08.170,00:23:10.000,也看了莞嫔的书信,00:23:09.240,00:23:11.371,And read her letter
00:23:11.220,00:23:13.380,允准皇后照顾龙胎,00:23:12.215,00:23:14.866,"and approved that the Empress
will take care of her pregnancy."
00:23:13.930,00:23:15.010,又传令下去,,,
00:23:15.930,00:23:17.890,恢复了她嫔位的待遇,00:23:15.058,00:23:18.860,"I've also ordered her stipends
to be restored as Concubine."
00:23:18.100,00:23:19.760,可是莞嫔心郁难解,00:23:18.940,00:23:21.020,But Concubine Sourire is deeply dispirited.
00:23:20.310,00:23:21.600,没有皇上的宽恕,,,
00:23:21.900,00:23:23.100,她总是郁郁寡欢,00:23:21.198,00:23:24.600,"Without Your Majesty's forgiveness,
she won't be able to overcome her grief"
00:23:23.560,00:23:25.480,莫不如让臣妾去看顾莞嫔,,,
00:23:25.770,00:23:27.230,也好时时宽慰,00:23:24.775,00:23:28.300,"Will Your Majesty allow me to
accompany her and raise her spirits."
00:23:27.480,00:23:28.890,能给的朕都给,00:23:28.440,00:23:30.400,I will give everything I could.
00:23:29.610,00:23:31.900,只是朕宠坏了莞嫔,00:23:30.515,00:23:33.268,But I have already spoiled Concubine Sourire so much
00:23:32.160,00:23:35.360,宠得她不知天高地厚 任意妄为,00:23:33.268,00:23:36.520,"that she has forgotten
""the bounds of Heaven and Earth""."
00:23:36.120,00:23:38.110,她也该受罚好了,00:23:37.362,00:23:38.720,She deserves some punishment.
,,,00:23:38.720,00:23:39.720,Enough!
00:23:42.250,00:23:44.830,皇上 皇后娘娘求见,00:23:43.200,00:23:46.000,"Your Majesty, Her Majesty the Empress
requests an audience."
00:23:45.420,00:23:45.910,传,,,
00:23:46.250,00:23:46.870,嗻,00:23:46.486,00:23:47.600,Show her in.
,,,00:23:47.640,00:23:48.395,Yes.
00:23:49.920,00:23:51.130,你先退下吧,00:23:50.700,00:23:52.420,You should leave.
00:24:00.890,00:24:02.550,臣妾给皇后请安,00:24:01.748,00:24:04.348,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:24:07.230,00:24:08.640,皇上万福金安,,,
00:24:08.820,00:24:09.650,平身吧,00:24:08.426,00:24:10.806,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Rise"
00:24:10.190,00:24:11.810,方才见惠贵人出去,00:24:11.180,00:24:12.980,I saw Lady Vertu left.
00:24:12.280,00:24:14.610,肯定和臣妾所求是同一件事,00:24:13.220,00:24:15.760,She must have come to make the same request.
00:24:15.570,00:24:16.310,皇上,00:24:16.560,00:24:17.560,"Your Majesty,"
00:24:16.660,00:24:19.620,莞嫔有孕 还请皇上去探望一下,00:24:17.600,00:24:20.700,"Concubine Sourire is pregnant.
Your Majesty should visit her."
00:24:20.250,00:24:23.700,算了眼下不看也罢,00:24:21.320,00:24:23.045,It's all right.
00:24:24.420,00:24:26.120,待孩子出生总会见的,00:24:23.551,00:24:25.000,It's not necessary for now.
,,,00:24:25.400,00:24:27.360,"I will see her eventually
when the child is born."
00:24:27.210,00:24:30.250,莞嫔如今依然禁足于碎玉轩中,00:24:28.335,00:24:31.375,"Concubine Sourire is still confined
in the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:24:30.550,00:24:33.000,不知皇上可准其解禁,00:24:31.600,00:24:34.160,I wonder if your Majesty would lift her confinement.
00:24:33.430,00:24:34.130,不必了,00:24:34.480,00:24:35.566,No need.
00:24:35.760,00:24:38.880,就让她待在那儿安心养胎吧,00:24:36.820,00:24:40.000,Let her rest quietly there
00:24:39.180,00:24:40.220,省得冒冒失失,00:24:40.000,00:24:41.720,in case she makes other mistakes.
00:24:40.520,00:24:43.880,那臣妾就派太医定期去请脉,00:24:41.720,00:24:45.004,Then I will send doctors to check her pulse regularly
00:24:44.400,00:24:46.180,照看好她的起居便是,00:24:45.340,00:24:47.480,and attend to her diet and health.
00:24:46.560,00:24:49.050,要是她想去御花园也要派人跟着,00:24:47.620,00:24:50.560,"Make sure she is accompanied
if she wants to go to the Imperial Garden."
00:24:50.360,00:24:53.320,以后这样的琐事你自己打点便可,00:24:51.360,00:24:54.360,You take charge of these trivial matters from now.
00:24:53.650,00:24:54.640,无须再来问朕,00:24:54.500,00:24:56.071,No need to ask me.
00:24:55.740,00:24:56.850,臣妾遵旨,00:24:56.760,00:24:58.391,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:25:00.290,00:25:00.900,小主,,,
00:25:01.330,00:25:02.490,惠贵人托温大人,,,
00:25:02.870,00:25:03.830,送来的肚兜好精致啊,00:25:01.280,00:25:05.060,"My Lady, this bib from Lady Vertu is so nicely made."
00:25:04.500,00:25:06.330,小孩子穿上一定很好看,00:25:05.651,00:25:07.800,It's sure to look cute on your baby.
00:25:08.750,00:25:10.210,小主都已经五个月了,00:25:09.711,00:25:11.760,You have been pregnant for five months.
00:25:11.420,00:25:12.660,皇上也不来看看,00:25:12.440,00:25:13.960,His Majesty never visited.
00:25:13.800,00:25:15.160,皇上该厌极了我,00:25:14.946,00:25:16.680,His Majesty must be disgusted with me so utterly.
00:25:16.800,00:25:18.790,皇上不来 咱也没奈何,00:25:17.818,00:25:20.098,There's nothing we can do about His Majesty.
00:25:20.180,00:25:22.010,倒是端妃和敬妃,,,
00:25:22.350,00:25:24.640,总是托温大人送来安慰的话,00:25:21.220,00:25:25.800,"However, Consort Estime and Consort Honnête
always send comforting words through Dr. Wen."
00:25:26.480,00:25:29.090,只是那安嫔却从来毫不问津,00:25:27.340,00:25:30.240,"Conversely, Concubine An has never asked about you."
00:25:29.980,00:25:31.640,看了让人真是心寒,00:25:30.940,00:25:32.840,It sends chills to the heart.
00:25:32.940,00:25:34.060,世态炎凉,00:25:33.940,00:25:35.708, People's hearts change like temperature.
00:25:36.410,00:25:39.150,从来同富贵易 共患难难,00:25:37.120,00:25:40.280,"It’s always easy to share prosperity but
hard to bear adversity together."
00:25:40.870,00:25:44.450,人心如此我又何必心寒,00:25:42.002,00:25:44.000,People’s hearts have always been this way.
,,,00:25:44.099,00:25:46.120,Why do I feel chilled?
00:25:49.170,00:25:49.750,娘娘,,,
00:25:50.460,00:25:51.250,温大人,00:25:50.000,00:25:51.000,Your Highness.
00:25:52.550,00:25:53.960,惠贵人让微臣,00:25:51.520,00:25:52.560,Dr. Wen.
00:25:54.260,00:25:55.790,给娘娘带来一盒桃花姬,00:25:53.460,00:25:55.120,Lady Vertu bid me bring you
,,,00:25:55.140,00:25:57.040,a box of ejiao cakes.
00:26:16.400,00:26:18.820,心不禁 得自在,00:26:17.558,00:26:20.238,"""A free heart is unconfined."""
00:26:21.450,00:26:22.990,还是眉姐姐惦记着我,00:26:22.358,00:26:24.360,Meizhuang is always thinking about me.
00:26:26.290,00:26:29.080,微臣还给娘娘带来了一个好消息,00:26:27.378,00:26:30.280,"I have good news for Your Highness, too."
00:26:30.290,00:26:32.750,想必娘娘听了之后会宽心不少,00:26:31.260,00:26:33.800,"I believe Your Highness will
feel relieved after hearing it."
00:26:33.300,00:26:33.910,你说,,,
00:26:34.670,00:26:36.330,当前娘娘受困于宫中,00:26:34.360,00:26:35.520,Please say it.
00:26:36.880,00:26:38.670,一直害怕连累到宫外的家人,00:26:35.760,00:26:37.640,Your Highness is confined in the palace.
,,,00:26:37.880,00:26:40.080,"You have been afraid of implicating
your family outside."
00:26:39.550,00:26:41.340,这一点娘娘大可放心,00:26:40.720,00:26:42.720,You can rest assured about this.
00:26:42.100,00:26:42.960,据微臣所知,00:26:43.318,00:26:44.320,As far as I know
00:26:43.390,00:26:45.220,娘娘的家人并未受到牵连,00:26:44.380,00:26:46.360,your family is not implicated.
00:26:46.390,00:26:48.850,倒是他们很担心娘娘的处境,00:26:47.540,00:26:50.080,"But they are very worried about
Your Highness's situation."
00:26:49.730,00:26:50.760,温大人的消息,,,
00:26:51.270,00:26:52.850,的确令本宫宽慰不少,00:26:50.700,00:26:52.200,"This news from you, Dr. Wen,"
,,,00:26:52.340,00:26:54.000,is indeed comforting to me.
00:26:54.610,00:26:56.190,也烦请大人转告家中,00:26:55.620,00:26:57.560,Please tell my family that
00:26:57.440,00:27:00.230,本宫一切安好无须挂念,00:26:58.662,00:27:01.462,"I am all good.
There's no need to worry about me."
00:27:01.870,00:27:03.030,微臣知道分寸,00:27:02.920,00:27:04.640,I understand what is proper to say.
00:27:04.450,00:27:06.240,刚才温太医来过了,00:27:05.480,00:27:07.480,Dr. Wen came just now.
00:27:07.120,00:27:10.110,说莞嫔胎像平稳一切安好,00:27:08.060,00:27:11.817,"He said that Concubine Sourire's
pregnancy is stable and everything is fine."
00:27:12.710,00:27:14.070,胎像平稳,00:27:13.878,00:27:15.593,Her pregnancy is stable…
00:27:15.000,00:27:18.210,娘娘 看来莞嫔再过数月,00:27:16.020,00:27:19.360,"Your Majesty, it looks like Concubine Sourire"
00:27:18.630,00:27:20.090,便可瓜熟蒂落了,00:27:19.540,00:27:22.040,"will ""have her melon ripe and dropped""
in a few months."
00:27:21.640,00:27:23.220,娘娘 我们可要,,,
00:27:23.470,00:27:24.960,皇上让本宫亲自照顾,00:27:22.715,00:27:24.715,"Your Majesty, should we…"
00:27:25.260,00:27:26.630,莞嫔怀孕生产的事,00:27:24.715,00:27:27.760,"His Majesty asked me to take care of
Concubine Souire's pregnancy and childbirth."
00:27:27.720,00:27:29.890,本宫岂能有负所托,00:27:28.720,00:27:30.900,How could I betray his trust?
00:27:30.770,00:27:32.630,这当口有本宫在,00:27:31.800,00:27:33.660,"At this juncture,"
00:27:33.110,00:27:34.640,谁也不能生事,00:27:34.000,00:27:36.020,no one can make trouble in front of me.
00:27:35.150,00:27:37.980,那假若是她自己没了孩子呢,00:27:36.242,00:27:39.222,What if she loses her child herself?
00:27:38.820,00:27:41.860,臣妾最近听说莞嫔一直郁郁寡欢,00:27:39.740,00:27:43.200,"I heard that Concubine Sourire
has always been in low spirits."
00:27:42.610,00:27:45.070,可孕中不宜过分伤心,00:27:43.560,00:27:46.280,But it’s no good to be so sad during pregnancy.
00:27:45.410,00:27:48.120,否则会影响胎儿,00:27:46.498,00:27:49.158,"Otherwise, it would affect the baby."
00:27:48.370,00:27:49.160,何止啊,,,
00:27:49.580,00:27:51.200,若是到了月份大的时候,00:27:49.646,00:27:50.802,Far more than that.
00:27:51.540,00:27:53.370,不小心就会一尸两命,00:27:50.802,00:27:52.400,"In the last months of pregnancy,"
,,,00:27:52.460,00:27:54.760,"it could accidentally kill both
the mother and the child."
00:27:55.710,00:28:00.000,钱名世的古香亭诗集诗语悖逆,00:27:56.500,00:28:00.920,"Qian Mingshi's Aromatic Ancient Pavilion
is a collection of rebellious poems."
00:28:01.590,00:28:05.080,朕已经将他革职抄家逐回原籍,00:28:02.640,00:28:06.400,"I have dismissed him, seized his property, and exiled him to his hometown."
00:28:06.390,00:28:10.180,京中的官员都要写诗责骂于他,00:28:07.546,00:28:11.471,"All officials in the capital must
write poems to denounce him."
00:28:11.230,00:28:13.340,并将这些诗结合成集,,,
00:28:13.650,00:28:15.260,刊印派发全国,00:28:12.451,00:28:16.724,"These poems will be compiled and
published for nationwide distribution."
00:28:16.270,00:28:17.480,你都办好了吗,,,
00:28:18.610,00:28:19.310,回禀皇上,00:28:17.406,00:28:19.346,Have you finished doing that?
00:28:19.610,00:28:21.570,奴才已经仔细地看过这些诗,00:28:19.640,00:28:22.782,"Your Majesty, I have read the poems carefully."
00:28:22.610,00:28:25.570,尤以英武殿纂修方苞所作最佳,00:28:23.580,00:28:26.806,"The very best poem is written by Fang Bao,
the chief compiler of the Yingwu Hall."
00:28:26.120,00:28:29.450,正詹事陈万策所作也颇有新意,00:28:27.140,00:28:30.880,"Counselor of the Princes, Chen Wance's
work is also quite creative."
00:28:30.040,00:28:33.660,但是陈邦彦与吴孝登二人作诗,00:28:31.202,00:28:34.822,But Chen Bangyan and Wu Xiaodeng wrote poems
00:28:34.120,00:28:35.240,同情钱名世,00:28:35.000,00:28:37.121,that sympathize with Qian Mingshi.
00:28:37.040,00:28:38.280,越到这些事上,00:28:38.331,00:28:40.000,"When it comes to such matters,"
00:28:40.800,00:28:43.080,才知道底下的臣子是否忠心,00:28:42.111,00:28:44.891,it shows me if the officials are loyal.
00:28:44.840,00:28:46.930,朕登基以来,,,
00:28:47.350,00:28:49.630,一直担心朝中异党未除,00:28:45.898,00:28:50.873,"Since I acceded to the throne, I have been worried
that the opposing faction hasn’t been eliminated."
00:28:51.100,00:28:53.340,这就是个排查官员中,,,
00:28:53.690,00:28:55.300,是否有异心的好时候,00:28:52.180,00:28:57.084,"This is a good time to investigate whether
there is anyone disloyal among the officials."
00:28:56.860,00:29:01.570,既然陈邦彦吴孝登同情钱名世,00:28:58.131,00:29:02.851,"Since Chen Bangyan and Wu Xiaodeng
sympathize with Qian Mingshi,"
00:29:02.280,00:29:05.490,那就将陈邦彦革职,00:29:03.446,00:29:06.746,Chen Bangyan will be dismissed
00:29:06.620,00:29:08.980,吴孝登发配育古塔,00:29:07.600,00:29:10.560,and Wu Xiaodeng will be banished to Ningguta.
00:29:09.530,00:29:10.440,奴才遵旨,00:29:10.560,00:29:12.160,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:29:12.620,00:29:15.490,但有一事奴才不敢不说,00:29:13.640,00:29:16.960,"But there is one thing I dare not
conceal from Your Majesty."
00:29:16.380,00:29:17.110,你说,,,
00:29:17.380,00:29:19.620,甄远道甄大人并未作诗,00:29:17.440,00:29:18.631,Say it.
00:29:19.920,00:29:20.910,谴责钱名世,00:29:18.631,00:29:22.334,"Zhen Yuandao, Mr. Zhen, didn’t write
poems to condemn Qian Mingshi."
00:29:22.630,00:29:24.420,甄大人自称文采不佳,00:29:23.758,00:29:26.073,Mr. Zhen said he had poor literary talent
00:29:25.630,00:29:26.870,不能以诗作见人,00:29:26.073,00:29:27.820,and his poems wouldn't be presentable.
00:29:27.140,00:29:27.870,所以推辞了,00:29:27.980,00:29:29.280,So he demurred.
00:29:28.470,00:29:31.840,他是言官出身会作诗不佳,00:29:29.698,00:29:33.258,"He has always been a civil official.
How can he not be good at verse?"
00:29:34.850,00:29:35.590,你说,00:29:35.840,00:29:37.342,Do you think so?
00:29:36.140,00:29:38.480,前一次奴才向皇上禀报,00:29:37.342,00:29:39.762,"As I have reported to Your Majesty,"
00:29:38.940,00:29:41.020,甄远道私藏钱名世的逆书,00:29:40.000,00:29:42.840,"Zhen Yuandao secretly keeps the
rebellious book of Qian Mingshi."
00:29:41.780,00:29:44.690,这次甄远道又不写诗谴责钱名世,00:29:42.840,00:29:45.760,"This time, Zhen Yuandao refused to write
poems to condemn Qian Mingshi"
00:29:44.950,00:29:45.730,以正立场,00:29:45.880,00:29:47.320,to clarify his stance.
00:29:46.280,00:29:49.740,奴才怕甄远道真的心怀异望,00:29:47.498,00:29:51.018,"I am afraid of Zhen Yuandao harbors
treasonous intent in his mind."
00:29:54.290,00:29:58.030,你不要以朕的名义胁迫甄远道,00:29:55.546,00:29:59.286,Don't intimidate Zhen Yuandao in my name.
00:29:59.040,00:30:01.830,而是要婉转地劝告他,00:30:00.000,00:30:02.800,"Instead, advise him tactfully."
00:30:03.130,00:30:04.370,给他三日时间,00:30:04.222,00:30:06.057,Give him three days.
00:30:06.340,00:30:09.580,若是肯谴责钱名世也就罢了,00:30:07.340,00:30:11.000,"This will be forgiven if he’s willing
to condemn Qian Mingshi."
00:30:10.510,00:30:13.720,否则朕也会处置他,00:30:11.460,00:30:12.847,"Otherwise,"
,,,00:30:13.646,00:30:15.280,I will also punish him.
00:30:14.350,00:30:17.220,是可是甄远道,00:30:15.458,00:30:16.575,Yes.
00:30:17.560,00:30:19.140,毕竟是莞嫔娘娘的生父,00:30:17.019,00:30:20.466,But Zhen Yuandao is the father of Concubine Sourire.
00:30:20.110,00:30:23.940,奴才怕此事惊动了莞嫔娘娘养胎,00:30:21.160,00:30:22.360,I'm afraid
00:30:24.650,00:30:25.480,就不好了,00:30:23.037,00:30:25.120,that it would affect Her Highness's pregnancy.
00:30:25.860,00:30:27.650,这件事朕自有分寸,00:30:25.580,00:30:26.960,That would not be desired.
,,,00:30:27.000,00:30:29.271,I know what is proper.
00:30:28.740,00:30:31.320,你去亲口问问钱名世,00:30:30.000,00:30:32.800,Go and ask Qian Mingshi personally
00:30:32.530,00:30:35.990,甄远道为何会有他的诗集,00:30:33.620,00:30:37.080,why Zhen Yuandao had his poem anthology.
00:30:37.330,00:30:37.910,是,00:30:38.160,00:30:39.040,Yes.
00:30:43.170,00:30:43.880,温大人,,,
00:30:44.170,00:30:45.130,麻烦你通报一声,00:30:43.871,00:30:44.898,Dr. Wen.
,,,00:30:44.898,00:30:46.074,Please report my arrival.
00:30:45.340,00:30:47.170,真不巧我家小主正睡着,00:30:46.074,00:30:48.120,"Unfortunately, My Lady is asleep."
00:30:48.050,00:30:50.420,娘娘有孕在身本该好好休息,00:30:49.120,00:30:51.706,"Her Highness is pregnant,
so she should have a good rest."
00:30:50.930,00:30:52.380,我且在廊下候着便是,00:30:51.940,00:30:53.654,I'll just wait in the corridor.
00:30:53.560,00:30:54.540,对了洗碧姑娘,00:30:54.540,00:30:55.860,"By the way, Jade,"
00:30:55.060,00:30:57.340,小主的抽筋病可好些了,00:30:55.860,00:30:58.600,are My Lady’s cramps getting better?
00:30:57.980,00:30:58.890,还是老样子,,,
00:30:59.190,00:31:00.600,小主夜里总睡不好,00:30:59.020,00:31:00.220,They are still the same.
00:31:01.900,00:31:03.930,那应该多给她喝一些骨头汤,00:31:00.220,00:31:02.060,My Lady can't sleep well at night.
00:31:04.270,00:31:05.180,再加少许醋,00:31:03.106,00:31:05.466,You should make her more bone soup
,,,00:31:05.466,00:31:06.520,with a little vinegar added.
00:31:05.530,00:31:07.940,平日里应该多吃些豆腐和蔬果,00:31:06.560,00:31:08.980,"She should eat more tofu, vegetables, and fruits daily."
00:31:08.200,00:31:09.900,这样可缓和抽筋的症状,00:31:09.120,00:31:11.360,These can alleviate cramps.
00:31:11.160,00:31:13.020,睡前也应该多喝一些牛乳,,,
00:31:13.330,00:31:14.440,这样睡得会香一些,00:31:12.040,00:31:15.800,"She should also drink some milk before
going to bed, so she can sleep better."
00:31:14.950,00:31:15.530,好,00:31:15.880,00:31:16.520,Yes.
00:31:15.790,00:31:17.400,我以后天天熬骨头汤给小主喝,00:31:16.580,00:31:18.480,I will make bone soup every day for My Lady.
00:31:17.790,00:31:19.650,洗碧可是温大人在外面,00:31:18.720,00:31:20.740,"Jade, is that Dr. Wen outside?"
00:31:19.960,00:31:20.570,请进来吧,00:31:20.840,00:31:21.680,Bring him in.
00:31:20.830,00:31:22.660,是小主温大人请,00:31:21.740,00:31:23.802,"Yes, My Lady. Dr. Wen, please."
00:31:30.800,00:31:31.880,请恕微臣直言,,,
00:31:32.340,00:31:33.380,娘娘睡不安稳,00:31:31.858,00:31:33.458,Please excuse my bluntness.
00:31:33.850,00:31:35.760,主要是因为思虑过多的原因,00:31:33.458,00:31:37.278,"Your Highness can’t sleep well, mainly because
you are burdened with thoughts and concerns."
00:31:36.350,00:31:38.010,这并非药力可以疏解的,00:31:37.638,00:31:39.320,This can’t be relieved by medicine.
00:31:38.980,00:31:41.720,大人既然知道又何必再说呢,00:31:39.700,00:31:43.115,"You already knew this.
Why bother to mention it again?"
00:31:43.730,00:31:45.640,大人等一下要去向皇后复命,00:31:44.780,00:31:47.324,You need to report to Her Majesty later.
00:31:46.860,00:31:49.190,请替本宫问候皇后,00:31:47.920,00:31:50.360,Please send my regards to Her Majesty.
00:31:50.820,00:31:52.280,就说本宫一切安好,00:31:51.840,00:31:53.760,And say I am well.
00:31:53.700,00:31:56.410,是皇后受皇上所托,00:31:54.440,00:31:55.572,Yes.
00:31:56.700,00:31:58.610,并不敢对娘娘和腹中的胎儿,00:31:56.016,00:31:57.891,"As entrusted by His Majesty,"
00:31:58.910,00:31:59.620,有所怠慢,00:31:57.891,00:32:00.658,"she doesn't dare to slight [snub?neglect?]
Your Highness or your unborn child."
00:32:00.250,00:32:02.330,她经常召见微臣过去询问,00:32:01.180,00:32:03.440,She often summons me to ask about you.
00:32:02.870,00:32:04.360,你知道如何应对就好,00:32:04.038,00:32:05.820,You know how to answer her.
00:32:06.000,00:32:06.620,明白了,,,
00:32:07.840,00:32:08.500,洗碧姑娘,00:32:06.958,00:32:08.122,Certainly.
00:32:09.170,00:32:10.290,你且与我去取药,00:32:08.760,00:32:10.000,Jade.
00:32:10.840,00:32:13.050,照例还拿回宫中小灶煎了,00:32:10.080,00:32:12.035,Come with me to collect the herbs.
00:32:13.760,00:32:15.340,记得要亲自给娘娘服下,00:32:12.035,00:32:14.400,Take them back and brew them here as usual.
00:32:15.760,00:32:16.750,不得由他人插手,00:32:14.740,00:32:16.640,Remember to serve Her Highness by your own hand.
,,,00:32:16.862,00:32:18.460,Don't let anyone else meddle.
00:32:17.430,00:32:20.340,是还是温大人想得周到,00:32:18.726,00:32:19.796,Yes.
00:32:21.560,00:32:23.100,眉姐姐的手伤可好些了,00:32:20.222,00:32:22.308,"You are very thoughtful, Dr. Wen."
,,,00:32:22.746,00:32:24.566,Is Meizhuang’s injured hand better?
00:32:24.650,00:32:25.430,已经好多了,00:32:25.758,00:32:27.082,It's been much better.
00:32:26.230,00:32:28.270,惠贵人的伤虽然是好得慢了些,00:32:27.260,00:32:29.160,"Although Lady Vertu recovered slowly,"
00:32:28.610,00:32:30.890,但也终究是在入夏之前彻底好了,00:32:29.760,00:32:32.129,"after all, her wound completely healed before summer."
00:32:31.570,00:32:34.610,只是还留下了一点淡淡的伤痕,00:32:32.642,00:32:35.682,"However, it just left a little scar."
00:32:34.870,00:32:38.400,伤痕姐姐没用舒痕胶吗,00:32:35.820,00:32:37.053,A scar?
,,,00:32:38.074,00:32:40.541,Didn't she use the Scar Relief Gel?
00:32:41.660,00:32:44.000,微臣还要到景仁宫去复命,00:32:42.798,00:32:45.138,I have to go to the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:32:44.580,00:32:45.320,先告退了,00:32:45.600,00:32:47.089,I shall take my leave.
00:32:54.760,00:32:55.370,娘娘,00:32:55.700,00:32:56.897,Your Highness...
00:32:56.140,00:32:58.380,若是安小主有任何东西交予娘娘,00:32:57.322,00:32:59.640,"If Lady An has anything sent to Your Highness,"
00:32:58.970,00:33:01.010,还请娘娘务必让微臣过目之后,00:33:00.178,00:33:01.998,make sure you won't use it
00:33:01.350,00:33:02.050,再行使用,,,
00:33:03.230,00:33:03.930,大人留步,00:33:02.397,00:33:03.737,until I have checked.
,,,00:33:04.282,00:33:05.562,Dr. Wen.
00:33:07.310,00:33:09.650,大人要本宫静心养胎不宜多思,00:33:08.240,00:33:11.526,"You have told me not to burden myself
with thoughts during my pregnancy."
00:33:10.730,00:33:12.400,可大人说话吞吞吐吐的,00:33:11.918,00:33:13.858,But you are mincing your words.
00:33:13.030,00:33:14.610,岂非存心叫本宫不安,00:33:14.202,00:33:16.360,Aren't you intentionally making me worry?
00:33:16.990,00:33:19.530,有什么话大人不妨直说,00:33:17.960,00:33:20.942,Please speak freely with me.
00:33:20.830,00:33:21.820,那舒痕胶里,00:33:21.838,00:33:23.573,The Scar Relief Gel…
00:33:26.420,00:33:28.750,那舒痕胶里面放了些东西,00:33:27.597,00:33:30.471,Something was added to the Scar Relief Gel.
00:33:32.710,00:33:33.450,麝香,00:33:33.780,00:33:34.875,Musk?
00:33:36.890,00:33:39.630,舒痕胶里有麝香是不是,00:33:38.160,00:33:41.060,Is there musk in the Scar Relief Gel?
00:33:40.720,00:33:43.430,是那舒痕胶里面,,,
00:33:43.680,00:33:44.970,放了分量不轻的康香,00:33:41.800,00:33:46.360,Yes. A large amount of musk was mixed into the Scar Relief Gel.
00:33:45.850,00:33:47.970,若通过伤口进入到人的肌理,00:33:46.980,00:33:49.100,"If you smear the gel on your wounds,"
00:33:48.310,00:33:49.720,就如同每日服食一般,00:33:49.360,00:33:50.640,your will body absorb the musk just as you take it orally.
00:33:50.770,00:33:52.310,且此胶花香浓郁,,,
00:33:52.650,00:33:54.730,目的就是遮掩住麝香的气味,00:33:51.160,00:33:56.080,"Additionally, the strong floral scent of the gel overshadows the smell of musk;"
00:33:55.900,00:33:57.140,若非懂得香料之人,,,
00:33:57.700,00:33:58.810,是调不出来的,00:33:56.820,00:34:00.960,only a spice expert is able to produce it.
00:34:01.660,00:34:05.280,娘娘其实也未必是安小主所为,00:34:02.580,00:34:07.040,Your Highness. Other people besides Lady An could have mixed the musk into the gel.
00:34:05.790,00:34:07.650,毕竟这舒痕胶在娘娘的宫中,,,
00:34:08.040,00:34:09.780,是其他人都可以接触得到的,00:34:07.280,00:34:10.700,"After all, this gel is accessible to anyone in your palace."
00:34:11.380,00:34:12.370,小主娘娘,00:34:12.537,00:34:14.037,"-Your Highness.
- My Lady."
00:34:13.050,00:34:15.540,娘娘你恶心得厉害吗,00:34:14.037,00:34:15.201,Your Highness.
00:34:16.130,00:34:17.500,人更叫我恶心,00:34:15.601,00:34:16.980,Do you feel sick?
,,,00:34:17.513,00:34:19.326,That woman [or person/people] makes me sick.
00:34:20.010,00:34:22.840,这件事眉姐姐知道吗,00:34:21.193,00:34:22.735,Has Meizhuang ...
00:34:23.970,00:34:24.960,微臣不敢妄言,00:34:22.913,00:34:24.458,known about this?
00:34:26.140,00:34:27.720,这件事切不可让她知道,00:34:24.760,00:34:26.504,I dare not say anything.
,,,00:34:27.306,00:34:29.419,You mustn't let her know about this.
00:34:29.940,00:34:31.800,若此事真为安陵容所为,00:34:31.020,00:34:33.058,If An Linrong really did this...
00:34:32.860,00:34:34.440,那决计是心计深重,00:34:33.900,00:34:35.993,What a scheming mind she has.
00:34:36.150,00:34:37.890,本宫现下如此潦倒,00:34:37.300,00:34:39.040,I'm in such a plight now.
00:34:38.660,00:34:40.360,眉姐姐更是势单力薄,00:34:39.540,00:34:41.817,Meizhuang must be more isolated than ever.
00:34:42.580,00:34:44.410,千万要记得转告眉姐姐,00:34:43.320,00:34:45.540,Be sure to pass my words to her:
00:34:45.750,00:34:47.950,千万不要得罪了皇后与安陵容,00:34:46.900,00:34:49.480,Don't ever displease the Empress and An Linrong.
00:34:48.710,00:34:49.410,知道吗,00:34:49.680,00:34:50.908,Do you understand?
00:34:53.460,00:34:54.290,你下去吧,00:34:54.380,00:34:55.680,You can go now.
00:35:11.100,00:35:12.840,小主应该高兴才是啊,00:35:12.382,00:35:14.388,"My Lady, you should be pleased."
00:35:14.270,00:35:15.010,高兴,,,
00:35:15.440,00:35:16.100,是啊,00:35:15.260,00:35:16.420,Should I?
,,,00:35:16.420,00:35:17.440,Yes.
00:35:17.110,00:35:19.320,小主一直疑心安小主的用心,00:35:18.200,00:35:20.642,My Lady has always doubted over Lady An's motives.
00:35:19.740,00:35:21.520,如果以前她还是个暗敌的话,00:35:20.900,00:35:22.740,"Though she hid in the dark before,"
00:35:21.780,00:35:23.820,那么她现在就算是个明敌了,00:35:22.740,00:35:24.869,she is an open enemy now.
00:35:24.580,00:35:26.160,我们岂不是更好防范了,00:35:25.680,00:35:28.000,Isn't it easier to guard ourselves against her?
00:35:27.450,00:35:28.570,小主在明处,,,
00:35:28.910,00:35:30.200,那暗处的敌人自然是,00:35:28.580,00:35:30.080,"As we are in the light,"
00:35:30.460,00:35:32.240,能少一个就少一个最好了,00:35:30.080,00:35:33.380,it's better to have fewer enemies in the dark.
00:35:35.050,00:35:36.880,小主是不是很痛心,,,
00:35:37.170,00:35:38.750,与安小主的姐妹情谊,00:35:35.920,00:35:39.740,"My Lady, are you sad about your
sisterly bond with Lady An?"
00:35:40.340,00:35:42.960,如今看来她与我,00:35:41.400,00:35:43.200,"Looking back,"
00:35:43.850,00:35:46.090,可还当得起姐妹情深这句话,00:35:43.200,00:35:44.473,She and I ...
00:35:47.640,00:35:49.220,小主与惠贵人的姐妹情谊,00:35:45.006,00:35:47.675,Did we ever have a sisterly bond?
00:35:49.560,00:35:50.390,实属难得,00:35:48.995,00:35:51.940,"While the sisterhood between you
and Lady Vertu is truly rare,"
00:35:50.730,00:35:53.220,可是不能要求人人都做到如此,00:35:51.940,00:35:54.355,it cannot be expected among everyone.
00:35:53.560,00:35:54.600,我实在不明白,,,
00:35:55.940,00:35:57.350,她为何要这样对我,00:35:54.540,00:35:56.024,But I can't understand
00:35:57.650,00:35:58.730,小主无须明白,00:35:57.022,00:35:58.600,why she did this to me.
00:35:58.990,00:36:00.650,就算是有一天真的知晓了,00:35:58.700,00:36:00.240,"My Lady, you need not understand anything."
00:36:00.990,00:36:03.320,那也必是极丑恶不堪的真相,00:36:00.240,00:36:04.775,"Even if one day you find out the truth,
it must be unbearably hideous."
00:36:04.450,00:36:06.060,小主对安小主是好,00:36:05.626,00:36:07.520,"My Lady, you are kind to Lady An."
00:36:06.950,00:36:09.320,可是有些人不是你对她好,,,
00:36:09.580,00:36:10.740,她便会对你好的,00:36:07.980,00:36:11.840,But not everyone reciprocates your favors.
00:36:12.870,00:36:15.660,我知道眼下的我,00:36:13.800,00:36:15.384,I'm aware
00:36:16.840,00:36:18.290,没有任何能力去反抗,00:36:15.917,00:36:17.737,"that right now,"
,,,00:36:18.003,00:36:20.204,I have no ability to fight back.
00:36:20.380,00:36:21.370,你说得不错,00:36:21.360,00:36:22.893,You are correct.
00:36:22.720,00:36:26.130,好与坏都是为了自身利益而已,00:36:23.760,00:36:27.180,"Good or ill, she did it for her own interests."
00:36:28.260,00:36:31.880,我曾经疑心陵容或许是受人指使,00:36:29.520,00:36:33.600,"I was suspicious that Linrong might
have been manipulated by others."
00:36:33.900,00:36:35.350,但不管是不是她愿意,00:36:34.860,00:36:37.120,"But whether she was willing or not,"
00:36:36.190,00:36:38.150,是她做的就是她做的,00:36:37.220,00:36:39.280,she did what she did.
00:36:42.360,00:36:43.230,槿汐,00:36:43.240,00:36:44.475,"Jinxi,"
00:36:46.950,00:36:48.530,你总能及时叫我明白,00:36:48.040,00:36:49.680,you always help me see clearly.
00:36:49.490,00:36:51.700,小主重情才会如此伤心呢,00:36:50.686,00:36:53.261,"My Lady, you are sad because you cherish your bond."
00:36:53.160,00:36:54.370,但是你要记住,,,
00:36:54.580,00:36:55.620,在后宫之中,00:36:54.420,00:36:55.880,But you need to remember that
00:36:56.330,00:36:59.670,就算是亲姐妹也会反目的,00:36:55.960,00:37:00.540,"even real sisters can turn against
each other in the harem."
00:37:00.760,00:37:04.960,不错君臣夫妻尚且如此,00:37:01.800,00:37:02.800,Right.
,,,00:37:04.165,00:37:06.926,"Even husband and wife can turn against each other,"
00:37:06.470,00:37:08.330,何况是这样所谓的姐妹,00:37:07.220,00:37:09.860,let alone the so-called sisters.
00:37:16.270,00:37:19.430,皇上昨夜里您又没睡好,00:37:17.240,00:37:20.480,Your Majesty didn't sleep well again last night.
00:37:19.860,00:37:21.890,要不再去睡会儿,00:37:21.120,00:37:23.166,How about going for a nap?
00:37:24.700,00:37:25.650,你先下去吧,00:37:25.620,00:37:27.197,You may go now.
00:37:26.570,00:37:27.780,叫苏培盛来伺候,00:37:27.600,00:37:29.220,Su Peisheng will serve me.
00:37:29.280,00:37:29.860,是,00:37:30.300,00:37:31.525,Yes.
00:37:34.250,00:37:35.360,臣妾告退,00:37:35.160,00:37:36.635,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:37:44.300,00:37:45.000,皇上,,,
00:37:46.050,00:37:46.910,她那儿怎么样,00:37:45.354,00:37:46.587,Your Majesty.
00:37:47.680,00:37:48.290,皇上,00:37:47.020,00:37:48.324,How has she been?
,,,00:37:48.600,00:37:49.680,Your Majesty.
00:37:48.760,00:37:51.050,您让人封了宫不许人出入啊,00:37:49.900,00:37:52.417,You forbade people coming in or out her palace.
00:37:52.180,00:37:53.840,你越发会当差了,00:37:53.180,00:37:55.240,You surely know how to do your job.
00:37:55.850,00:37:56.720,皇上恕罪,00:37:57.066,00:37:58.523,I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:37:57.650,00:38:00.100,奴才是怕皇上知道了会担心哪,00:37:58.720,00:38:01.451,"I am afraid that Your Majesty will be
worried after knowing her situation."
00:38:01.270,00:38:02.230,她哪里不好吗,00:38:02.420,00:38:03.913,Is something wrong?
00:38:03.820,00:38:05.680,不是已经过了头三个月了吗,00:38:05.086,00:38:07.080,Hasn't it already passed the first three months?
00:38:06.950,00:38:08.150,皇上您是知道的,00:38:08.140,00:38:09.562,Your Majesty is aware that
00:38:08.700,00:38:10.980,上一胎的时候莞嫔就伤了元气,00:38:09.780,00:38:12.326,"Concubine Sourire's innate qi
was sapped by her miscarriage."
00:38:11.450,00:38:14.360,如今被禁足着心里难免气苦啊,00:38:12.660,00:38:15.360,"Now she must be feeling upset
being confined in her palace."
00:38:15.000,00:38:15.830,听槿汐说,00:38:15.900,00:38:17.220,I heard from Jinxi that
00:38:16.080,00:38:18.290,娘娘是一宿一宿地睡不好觉,00:38:17.220,00:38:19.440,Her Highness has had one sleepless night after another.
00:38:18.630,00:38:20.830,皇上您想娘娘都睡不好,00:38:19.660,00:38:20.820,"Your Majesty,"
00:38:21.130,00:38:22.660,那龙胎能睡得好吗,00:38:20.820,00:38:23.740,"can the imperial heir sleep well
while Her Highness cannot?"
00:38:24.010,00:38:25.500,你说得倒也是实话,00:38:25.000,00:38:26.678,What you said is true.
00:38:28.890,00:38:30.250,朕热得睡不着,,,
00:38:30.760,00:38:31.800,陪朕出去走走,00:38:29.940,00:38:31.655,It's too hot to sleep now.
00:38:32.140,00:38:34.680,嘛那奴才去传轿去,00:38:31.655,00:38:33.309,Go on a walk with me.
00:38:35.020,00:38:36.470,万一皇上受了暑热,00:38:33.575,00:38:35.970,"Yes, I will have a sedan chair prepared."
00:38:36.730,00:38:38.340,那奴才就罪该万死了,00:38:36.236,00:38:39.782,"Were Your Majesty's health affected by the heat,
I'd deserve a thousand deaths."
00:38:38.850,00:38:39.970,不用万死,00:38:40.000,00:38:41.431,That's not necessary.
00:38:40.650,00:38:42.760,你这样死一回就够了,00:38:41.653,00:38:43.680,One death for you will suffice.
00:38:43.780,00:38:46.860,你死了朕自然有心凉的地方去,00:38:44.934,00:38:48.014,I will certainly have a place to chill if that happens.
00:38:48.360,00:38:49.690,那奴才给皇上打伞,00:38:49.470,00:38:51.466,Then allow me to hold a parasol for Your Majesty.
00:38:56.700,00:38:57.780,皇上万福金安,00:38:57.780,00:38:59.659,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:39:02.040,00:39:04.030,她时常都这样睡得不安稳吗,00:39:03.239,00:39:05.520,Does she often sleep restlessly like this?
00:39:09.220,00:39:11.580,小主这两日隐约觉得有些胎动,00:39:10.222,00:39:13.000,My Lady started to feel the baby moving in recent days
00:39:12.220,00:39:13.050,睡不好觉,,,
00:39:13.470,00:39:14.880,所以显得格外疲累,00:39:13.120,00:39:14.380,so she can't sleep well.
00:39:15.310,00:39:16.090,饮食怎么样,00:39:14.735,00:39:16.256,That's why she looks especially exhausted.
00:39:16.720,00:39:18.260,送来的东西都吃了吗,00:39:16.478,00:39:17.608,How about her diet?
,,,00:39:17.963,00:39:19.814,Does she eat the food sent to her?
00:39:20.190,00:39:21.470,小主伤心不已,00:39:21.122,00:39:22.979,My lady has been overwhelmed by sadness.
00:39:21.940,00:39:25.180,饮食每每在减少食不知味,00:39:22.979,00:39:24.461,Her appetite has been decreasing
,,,00:39:25.180,00:39:26.964,and she looks preoccupied while dining.
00:39:26.440,00:39:27.980,那就是她不懂事了,00:39:27.550,00:39:29.090,That‘s not wise of her.
00:39:28.280,00:39:30.640,为了孩子多少也应该吃一点,00:39:29.090,00:39:31.662,She should make an effort for the child.
00:39:31.030,00:39:32.070,小主她不是不想吃,,,
00:39:32.240,00:39:32.950,朕知道,00:39:32.070,00:39:33.305,It's not that My lady doesn't want to ...
,,,00:39:33.305,00:39:34.326,I know.
00:39:34.370,00:39:36.450,皇上时辰不早了,00:39:35.613,00:39:37.515,"Your Majesty, it's been a while."
00:39:36.740,00:39:38.200,让人知道了不好,00:39:37.737,00:39:39.880,Better not to let the others notice us.
00:39:43.130,00:39:44.710,好好伺候你们家小主,00:39:44.062,00:39:45.997,Take good care of your lady.
00:39:45.500,00:39:46.370,有你的好处,,,
00:39:47.300,00:39:48.000,是,00:39:46.619,00:39:48.000,You‘ll benefit too.
,,,00:39:48.444,00:39:49.677,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:40:08.530,00:40:09.610,娘娘恕罪,,,
00:40:09.820,00:40:11.610,奴婢并非有意打扰娘娘,00:40:09.610,00:40:11.285,I hope Your Highness will forgive me.
00:40:12.110,00:40:13.270,只是皇上有旨,00:40:11.285,00:40:13.075,I didn't mean to intrude.
00:40:13.660,00:40:15.320,要奴婢出入相随,00:40:13.270,00:40:16.440,"I’m just following His Majesty's decree
to accompany Your Highness in and out"
00:40:15.620,00:40:16.820,照顾娘娘安好,00:40:16.465,00:40:18.553,and take care of Your Highness.
00:40:17.950,00:40:20.990,照顾监视,00:40:19.130,00:40:20.558,Take care of...
,,,00:40:21.224,00:40:22.744,or keep a watch on...
00:40:22.080,00:40:25.700,在我看来皇上的旨意都是一样的,00:40:23.232,00:40:26.632,They sound like the same order to me.
00:40:27.090,00:40:28.790,娘娘要是觉得累了,,,
00:40:29.050,00:40:30.130,就坐下来歇歇,00:40:28.422,00:40:30.344,"If Your Majesty feels tired,"
00:40:30.760,00:40:33.120,月份大了难免容易觉得累,00:40:30.344,00:40:31.912,please sit for a while.
,,,00:40:31.912,00:40:35.426,"The more months you're in your
pregnancy, the faster you feel fatigued."
00:40:56.070,00:40:57.610,早知有今日之祸,00:40:56.958,00:40:59.253,"If I was able to foresee today's misfortune,"
00:40:58.200,00:41:01.490,奴婢当初宁愿不用心教习娘娘,00:40:59.253,00:41:02.733,"I would rather Your Highness never
had to learn etiquette from me"
00:41:02.410,00:41:04.950,免得入宫后受此罪过,00:41:03.342,00:41:06.370,and enter the palace to suffer.
00:41:06.080,00:41:07.790,本宫与姑姑都不是圣人,00:41:07.101,00:41:09.166,"We are not saints, Madam."
00:41:09.710,00:41:11.290,怎能知晓来日之事,00:41:10.687,00:41:12.667,How could either of us see the future?
00:41:12.340,00:41:15.130,其实皇上还是很关心娘娘的,00:41:13.537,00:41:16.283,"Actually, His Majesty still cares
a lot for Your Highness."
00:41:15.590,00:41:16.250,是吗,00:41:16.549,00:41:17.937,Does he?
00:41:18.760,00:41:19.970,他是关心本宫,00:41:19.781,00:41:21.391,Does he care for me...
00:41:22.020,00:41:23.970,还是关心本宫肚子里的孩子,00:41:23.174,00:41:25.390,Or for his child inside my belly？
00:41:24.520,00:41:25.510,皇上,00:41:26.000,00:41:27.064,His Majesty...
00:41:37.660,00:41:39.190,莞嫔娘娘吉祥,,,
00:41:40.030,00:41:41.700,她只不过是个失宠的嫔妃,00:41:38.681,00:41:40.655,Peace to Your Highness.
00:41:42.000,00:41:42.980,现在又是个罪妇,00:41:40.991,00:41:42.791,She is just a concubine out of favor
00:41:43.620,00:41:45.280,何必跟她行这样的大礼,00:41:42.791,00:41:44.685,and now bearing crimes.
,,,00:41:44.907,00:41:46.640,Why do you have to bow to her？
00:41:55.300,00:41:57.760,欣贵人倒是个实诚人,00:41:56.454,00:41:59.225,Lady Joie is very straightforward.
00:41:58.760,00:42:02.350,宫里的女人就像御花园里的花朵,00:42:00.000,00:42:03.436,"Women in the palace are like the
flowers in the imperial garden."
00:42:03.770,00:42:06.760,谢了自然会再开,00:42:04.791,00:42:07.781,"Some fade, and others will bloom."
00:42:08.900,00:42:12.890,女人老了一群又进来一群新的,00:42:10.000,00:42:14.212,"When some women age, the younger will enter."
00:42:15.320,00:42:17.180,像开不尽的春花一样,00:42:16.297,00:42:18.734,Like a spring that never ends.

[phoenix is the symbol of an empress]"
00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."

but you will never see it.",00:44:33.000,00:44:41.000,"A phoenix about to take flight rustles its wings
but the arc of its flight is unseen."

shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
00:44:51.000,00:45:04.000,The falling leaves from the phoenix tree.,00:44:51.000,00:45:04.000,"The phoenix tree sways in the wind,
