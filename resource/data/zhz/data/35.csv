00:02:31.120,00:02:32.180,两位姐姐坐吧,00:02:31.907,00:02:34.407,"Both of you, please have a seat."
00:02:35.080,00:02:36.950,岁寒大雪 禽鸟俱绝,00:02:36.007,00:02:38.407,The birds disappear in the snowy winter.
00:02:38.160,00:02:39.590,虽不比春日热闹,00:02:38.907,00:02:40.907,"Although it's not as lively as spring,"
00:02:40.240,00:02:41.510,可也别有一番味道,,,
00:02:42.560,00:02:43.540,的确如此,00:02:41.207,00:02:43.107,winter has its own charm.
00:02:44.560,00:02:45.700,姐姐以为如何,00:02:43.507,00:02:45.107,Indeed.
00:02:47.600,00:02:48.710,莞嫔叫赏雪,00:02:45.400,00:02:46.920,"What do you think, Lady Fuca?"
00:02:49.240,00:02:50.790,嫔妾也只会看看罢了,00:02:48.300,00:02:51.540,"Your Highness invited me to appreciate
winter's beauty, so I am."
00:02:51.480,00:02:54.990,这话说的 像是妹妹勉强你了,00:02:52.420,00:02:55.380,That makes me feel that I'm forcing you.
00:02:55.720,00:02:57.310,其实咱们姐妹多见见,,,
00:02:57.680,00:02:58.660,说说话多好,00:02:56.800,00:02:59.900,"Actually, it's good to see more of each other, and talk."
00:02:59.320,00:03:00.150,情谊深了,,,
00:03:00.400,00:03:02.230,误会嫌隙自然也会没有了,00:03:00.248,00:03:03.285,"In this way we'll become closer, and avoid misunderstandings and rifts."
00:03:02.520,00:03:04.030,咱们都是皇上身边的人,,,
00:03:04.600,00:03:05.950,哪里来的嫌隙呢,00:03:03.507,00:03:05.307,We are brought together by serving HIs Majesty.
00:03:06.800,00:03:07.860,这季节里,00:03:05.427,00:03:07.303,How could we have misunderstandings or rifts?
00:03:08.360,00:03:10.470,倒叫我想起冬日里的一个故事,00:03:07.500,00:03:11.700,Winter has reminded me of a story.
00:03:11.320,00:03:14.630,娘娘博学广知 嫔妾愿闻其详,00:03:12.220,00:03:15.940,"Your Highness is learned and educated.
I'd like to hear it."
00:03:15.920,00:03:17.590,是人彘的故事,00:03:16.707,00:03:19.107,"It's the story of ""human swine."""
00:03:18.880,00:03:20.470,哪里还是博学广知呢,00:03:19.407,00:03:21.607,I'm neither learned nor educated.
00:03:21.160,00:03:22.710,其实我也记不太清了,00:03:22.000,00:03:24.100,I don't remember the details well.
00:03:23.760,00:03:25.550,只记得汉高祖时,00:03:24.420,00:03:26.760,It happened during the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Han.
00:03:25.920,00:03:27.910,戚夫人得宠 冒犯吕后,00:03:26.800,00:03:29.400,Lady Qi gained favor and offended Empress Lü.
00:03:28.840,00:03:30.310,后来吕后成了太后,00:03:29.700,00:03:32.040,"After Empress Lü  became the Empress Dowager,"
00:03:31.240,00:03:32.750,就断了戚夫人手足,00:03:32.040,00:03:34.260,"she cut off Lady Qi's hands and feet,"
00:03:33.440,00:03:35.270,挖眼 削耳 饮哑药,00:03:34.300,00:03:36.880,"gouged her eyes, cut her ears, and used poison to make her mute."
00:03:36.040,00:03:38.550,关在厕中 称为人彘,00:03:37.100,00:03:40.060,"She locked her in the outhouse.
This punishment is called ""human swine""."
00:03:39.360,00:03:42.390,那戚夫人可是一代美人啊,00:03:40.400,00:03:43.300,Lady Qi was one of the most beautiful women of her time.
00:03:42.600,00:03:45.390,竟然沦落至此 实在是可惜了,00:03:43.640,00:03:46.540,It's so pathetic that she ended up like that.
00:03:45.840,00:03:47.550,虽然吕后手段残酷,00:03:46.860,00:03:48.380,"Empress Lü  was unbearably cruel,"
00:03:48.040,00:03:49.020,不过戚夫人妄想,,,
00:03:49.360,00:03:50.990,凭一时之势羞辱皇后,00:03:48.780,00:03:52.040,but Lady Qi had only herself to blame.
00:03:51.840,00:03:53.470,真是咎由自取了,00:03:52.840,00:03:55.160,She was deluded by her favor.
00:03:54.640,00:03:55.860,亦可见身为女子,,,
00:03:56.280,00:03:58.110,吕后记仇也是很深的,00:03:55.400,00:03:59.800,"Women can hold deep grudges, and Empress Lü  was no exception."
00:03:59.400,00:04:02.910,富察姐姐 你说是不是呢,00:04:00.280,00:04:01.400,"Lady Fuca,"
,,,00:04:02.720,00:04:03.580,am I right?
00:04:04.200,00:04:05.110,槿汐 小主,00:04:04.980,00:04:05.860,"- Jinxi.
- My Lady!"
00:04:05.440,00:04:08.310,快扶富察贵人坐好 是 快起来,00:04:06.080,00:04:07.720,Help Lady Fuca to her chair.
00:04:08.600,00:04:09.430,真是 这好好听故事,00:04:08.240,00:04:09.060,Yes.
00:04:09.800,00:04:10.940,妹妹你这是怎么了,00:04:09.200,00:04:10.600,It is only a story.
00:04:11.960,00:04:12.830,正是呢,00:04:10.907,00:04:12.407,"What's the matter, Fuca?"
00:04:13.440,00:04:14.580,怕是富察贵人姐姐,,,
00:04:15.000,00:04:16.110,嫌我故事讲得不好,00:04:12.807,00:04:17.307,Perhaps Lady Fuca was troubled by my lack of skill.
00:04:17.120,00:04:18.710,刚才我胡乱解释了一通,,,
00:04:19.080,00:04:20.430,让姐姐反而听不明白了,00:04:17.807,00:04:22.207,I told it so poorly - she could not understand it.
00:04:21.840,00:04:24.140,你讲人彘的故事用意何在,00:04:22.600,00:04:26.000,Why did you tell me that story?
00:04:26.280,00:04:28.030,年妃虽然跋扈专断,,,
00:04:28.760,00:04:30.590,可是有一点我却很佩服,00:04:27.240,00:04:31.440,"Although Consort Nian is arrogant and domineering,
I admire one of her qualities."
00:04:31.400,00:04:33.700,便是杀伐决断 毫不留情,00:04:32.300,00:04:34.900,She is ruthless when she is determined.
00:04:35.120,00:04:37.110,当年有人不过得罪了年妃一句,00:04:36.000,00:04:38.180,"In the past, someone simply made an offensive remark"
00:04:37.520,00:04:38.550,便被迁居别宫,00:04:38.220,00:04:40.240,and was banished to another palace.
00:04:39.880,00:04:42.470,若是年妃在长街受人欺凌,00:04:40.580,00:04:43.600,"If Consort Nian was abused on Long Street,"
00:04:43.480,00:04:44.750,不知会如何报复呢,00:04:43.880,00:04:45.880,I wonder how she would take revenge?
00:04:45.320,00:04:48.230,以年妃的心性 若此事当真,00:04:46.100,00:04:49.400,"If it happened to Consort Nian, given her temperament,"
00:04:48.920,00:04:51.910,只怕即便不让她受人彘之刑,00:04:49.807,00:04:52.807,"she would administer the human swine punishment,"
00:04:52.640,00:04:54.630,那也让她生不如死啊,00:04:53.100,00:04:55.900,or another more painful than death.
00:04:55.920,00:04:59.390,是啊 我若是早有年妃的性子,00:04:56.680,00:05:00.200,"Yes, if I were more like Consort Nian,"
00:04:59.960,00:05:02.470,入宫以后也不会任人欺凌了,00:05:00.600,00:05:03.780,"I wouldn't have allowed myself to be
bullied after I entered the harem."
00:05:03.480,00:05:06.350,妹妹 妹妹备受皇上宠爱,00:05:04.420,00:05:07.700,"Sourire, you are greatly favored by His Majesty."
00:05:07.080,00:05:08.510,又有什么不能呢,00:05:08.107,00:05:09.907,You can do anything you like.
00:05:09.520,00:05:11.870,莞嫔娘娘恕罪 嫔妾知道错了,00:05:10.200,00:05:11.980,I beg Your HIghness's forgiveness.
00:05:12.440,00:05:13.790,不敢了 再也不敢了,00:05:11.980,00:05:14.700,"I admit my fault.
I will not act like that again."
00:05:14.120,00:05:15.430,姐姐向来理直气壮,,,
00:05:15.920,00:05:16.900,何来有什么罪,00:05:15.007,00:05:18.207,"Fuca, you've always acted so sure of yourself.
Where is this guilt coming from?"
00:05:17.800,00:05:20.710,况且 我不过是在讲故事而已,00:05:18.400,00:05:22.000,I was just telling a story.
00:05:20.920,00:05:23.630,嫔妾 嫔妾是受齐妃娘娘指使啊,,,
00:05:24.320,00:05:25.110,娘娘恕罪,00:05:22.800,00:05:26.200,"I was listening to Consort Astuce.
I beg Your Highness's forgiveness."
00:05:25.360,00:05:26.830,是吗 娘娘,00:05:26.240,00:05:27.180,Were you?
00:05:27.160,00:05:29.460,无论什么事都以后再说,00:05:28.000,00:05:30.900,"Whatever it is, we can discuss it later."
00:05:31.280,00:05:32.230,我只是好奇,,,
00:05:32.840,00:05:34.750,司马迁虽然下笔如神,00:05:32.320,00:05:36.140,"Although Sima Qian [a historian in Han dynasty]
wrote as if dictated by Heaven,"
00:05:35.440,00:05:37.670,却不知真正的人彘是什么样子的,00:05:36.260,00:05:38.940,he didn't really know what a human swine was like.
00:05:38.200,00:05:40.790,听说这人彘还不算最厉害的呢,00:05:39.140,00:05:42.180,"As far as I know, human swine is not the worst."
00:05:41.880,00:05:45.390,在唐朝啊 有把妃嫔做成人彘的,00:05:42.860,00:05:46.500,"In the Tang Dynasty, concubines were made into human swine,"
00:05:46.360,00:05:48.820,再把这人彘浸泡酒缸里,00:05:47.200,00:05:50.300,and then soaked in a wine cask.
00:05:49.720,00:05:50.750,管这个叫,00:05:50.600,00:05:52.700,This punishment was called ...
00:05:52.280,00:05:53.110,骨醉,00:05:52.780,00:05:54.480,"""drunken bones""."
00:05:54.760,00:05:56.430,手法是狠毒了些,00:05:55.620,00:05:57.740,"Even though it was cruel,"
00:05:57.000,00:05:58.630,但凡事有因才有果,00:05:57.900,00:05:59.756,she should have expected it
00:05:59.080,00:06:00.430,也是意料之中的事,00:05:59.900,00:06:02.320,since every action has a consequence.
00:06:12.280,00:06:13.950,小主 小主 你怎么了,00:06:12.600,00:06:14.980,"My Lady, what's the matter with you?"
00:06:14.440,00:06:15.580,小主 你醒醒啊,00:06:15.360,00:06:16.560,"My Lady, please wake up."
00:06:15.960,00:06:17.430,我以为她多大的胆子呢,00:06:16.720,00:06:18.800,"I thought she had a strong stomach,"
00:06:18.200,00:06:20.310,不过是个色厉内荏的草包,00:06:19.060,00:06:21.760,but her boldness was hollow.
00:06:21.360,00:06:23.470,槿汐 富察贵人身子不适,,,
00:06:23.760,00:06:24.470,抬她回去吧,00:06:22.000,00:06:25.500,"Jinxi, Lady Fuca is not feeling well. Help her back."
00:06:24.880,00:06:25.470,小主,,,
00:06:25.640,00:06:26.270,来人,00:06:25.700,00:06:26.500,My Lady...
,,,00:06:26.500,00:06:27.440,Both of you!
00:06:34.040,00:06:36.550,来 过来 这边,00:06:34.600,00:06:38.100,"Come here, over here."
00:06:40.120,00:06:41.180,抬她走 是,00:06:40.900,00:06:43.180,"- Carry her away.
- Yes."
00:06:43.920,00:06:45.590,姑姑 要不要请太医去看,,,
00:06:45.960,00:06:47.150,找个太医走个过场便完了,00:06:44.860,00:06:46.900,"Madam, do we need to send for the imperial doctors?"
00:06:47.720,00:06:48.350,少费精神,00:06:46.900,00:06:49.440,"Tell a doctor to visit, but don't spend too much time on her."
00:06:48.560,00:06:49.230,是,00:06:49.800,00:06:51.060,Yes.
00:06:58.080,00:06:59.790,杀鸡是要做猴的,00:06:59.100,00:07:01.200,"""Kill the chicken to scare the monkey."""
00:07:00.560,00:07:02.710,如今鸡既椅完了,,,
00:07:03.400,00:07:05.430,不知娘娘要对旁观的嫔妾,00:07:01.500,00:07:07.500,"The chicken is dead now.
What does Your Highness want to tell me?"
00:07:05.760,00:07:06.470,说点什么呢,,,
00:07:06.920,00:07:09.270,和曹姐姐这样聪明的人说话真好,00:07:07.700,00:07:10.400,"It's good to talk with an intelligent woman like you, Lady Cao."
00:07:09.640,00:07:10.590,一点都不费力,,,
00:07:11.080,00:07:12.870,娘娘并非毒辣刁钻之人,00:07:10.560,00:07:12.240,Conversation becomes effortless.
,,,00:07:12.320,00:07:14.220,You are not cruel or vindictive.
00:07:13.600,00:07:15.830,倘若富察贵人真的得罪了娘娘,00:07:14.500,00:07:16.980,"If Lady Fuca really offended Your Highness,"
00:07:16.400,00:07:18.750,大可将她送去慎刑司发落便好,00:07:17.420,00:07:19.680,you could just send her to the Ministry of Penalty.
00:07:19.240,00:07:20.870,何必如此大费周折呢,00:07:20.360,00:07:22.440,You didn't need to stage this trouble.
00:07:22.160,00:07:23.140,娘娘如此做,,,
00:07:23.720,00:07:25.550,无非是想震慑臣妾罢了,00:07:23.100,00:07:26.840,Your Highness did this to instill fear.
00:07:26.720,00:07:27.780,所以,,,
00:07:28.440,00:07:31.230,娘娘 有话不妨直说,00:07:27.800,00:07:32.100,"If Your HIghness has something to say,
please say it to me directly."
00:07:31.560,00:07:32.910,曹姐姐九曲心肠,,,
00:07:33.240,00:07:34.300,一向爱拐弯抹角,00:07:32.400,00:07:35.900,"It usually takes ""nine turns to reach your heart"", Cao."
00:07:35.640,00:07:37.670,忽然要和你直接爽利地说话,00:07:36.580,00:07:38.800,I am quite surprised
00:07:38.160,00:07:39.430,还真有些不习惯呢,,,
00:07:40.480,00:07:42.350,前些日子妹妹感染风寒,00:07:38.907,00:07:41.107,to be invited to be candid.
00:07:42.720,00:07:44.670,每每荐了皇上去曹姐姐宫里,00:07:41.407,00:07:43.707,"I had a cold a few days ago,"
00:07:45.040,00:07:46.870,曹姐姐可还觉得好吗,00:07:43.800,00:07:47.700,"so I frequently reminded His Majesty to visit you.
I hope you didn't mind."
00:07:47.560,00:07:50.020,娘娘的心意嫔妾心领了,00:07:48.580,00:07:51.300,"I appreciated it, Your Highness."
00:07:50.920,00:07:53.380,只是皇上人虽在嫔妾那里,,,
00:07:53.720,00:07:55.270,心却在娘娘宫里,00:07:51.807,00:07:56.607,"But although His Majesty was with me,
his heart was with Your Highness"
00:07:55.840,00:07:57.670,时常魂不守舍的,00:07:56.845,00:07:59.211,as if his soul had no home.
00:07:58.280,00:07:59.590,曹姐姐冰雪聪明,00:07:59.300,00:08:01.300,"Lady Cao, you are intelligent."
00:08:00.400,00:08:02.780,其实不必在意皇上的心在谁那儿,00:08:01.300,00:08:04.000,You shouldn't worry where his heart resides.
00:08:03.440,00:08:05.310,俗话说见面三分情,00:08:04.379,00:08:07.062,“Seeing the person makes it harder to feel detached.”
00:08:06.160,00:08:08.350,只要皇上肯时时去你那儿坐坐,00:08:07.407,00:08:09.807,"As long as His Majesty visits you now and then,"
00:08:09.040,00:08:11.910,以姐姐的聪慧 自然是更得圣心,00:08:10.107,00:08:13.707,"assuredly you will gain heaven's favor
by using your clever mind."
00:08:13.080,00:08:14.910,年妃失宠连累曹姐姐,,,
00:08:15.360,00:08:16.830,更是冷落了温宜公主,00:08:14.024,00:08:18.130,"Consort Nian's loss of favor created a burden
for you, and affected Princess Wenyi."
00:08:17.840,00:08:18.750,皇上似乎,,,
00:08:19.000,00:08:20.510,有半年没去姐姐那儿了吧,00:08:18.600,00:08:22.200,"His Majesty had not visited you for half a year, had he?"
00:08:22.160,00:08:23.270,嫔妾福薄,,,
00:08:23.720,00:08:26.070,皇上不在意也是情理之中,00:08:23.040,00:08:27.160,"I'm not blessed by Heaven.
I don't expect His Majesty's attention."
00:08:26.920,00:08:28.990,其实姐姐受些委屈倒不要紧,00:08:27.600,00:08:29.900,"It isn't a concern to be treated this way,"
00:08:29.320,00:08:30.190,要紧的是公主,00:08:30.140,00:08:31.600,except for Princess Wenyi's sake.
00:08:31.040,00:08:33.190,若从小失了父皇的宠爱,00:08:32.020,00:08:34.600,"If she isn't cherished by her father during childhood,"
00:08:33.920,00:08:35.430,将来可要怎么打算呢,00:08:34.807,00:08:36.907,what will her future bring?
00:08:36.440,00:08:38.150,是嫔妾当日目光短浅,00:08:37.207,00:08:39.307,I was so shortsighted.
00:08:38.880,00:08:40.830,不知学良禽择佳木而栖,00:08:39.600,00:08:42.060,"I wasn't ""the smart bird that chooses a good tree to perch on""."
00:08:41.240,00:08:42.270,以致今日寥落,00:08:42.100,00:08:43.900,And now am in a bleak situation.
00:08:43.240,00:08:46.030,所以也不敢有所怨言,00:08:44.200,00:08:46.860,I don't blame anyone.
00:08:47.440,00:08:49.110,姐姐不该自怨自艾,00:08:48.480,00:08:50.560,You shouldn't waste time on regret.
00:08:49.680,00:08:52.430,公主的前程可是要姐姐去争取的,00:08:50.720,00:08:53.540,The Princess's future depends on you fighting for her.
00:08:53.600,00:08:54.990,从前世事如此,,,
00:08:55.600,00:08:56.870,姐姐选择跟着年妃,00:08:54.640,00:08:56.440,"As for the situation in the past,"
00:08:57.240,00:08:58.350,也不算目光短浅,00:08:56.440,00:08:59.500,it was not shortsighted to align yourself with Consort Nian.
00:08:59.080,00:09:01.460,何况当日要追随她也不是易事,00:08:59.860,00:09:02.900,And it was not an easy alliance to form.
00:09:02.760,00:09:03.710,只是姐姐现在,,,
00:09:04.000,00:09:05.390,还被人视为年妃一党,00:09:03.840,00:09:06.740,But you are still seen as closely affiliated with Consort Nian.
00:09:06.120,00:09:07.260,可要怎么好呢,00:09:06.920,00:09:08.060,That's not good.
00:09:08.000,00:09:11.310,其实嫔妾也很为将来之事担忧,00:09:09.000,00:09:12.320,"In truth, I am greatly concerned for our future."
00:09:12.160,00:09:14.750,但求不要被年妃连累了便好,00:09:12.980,00:09:15.780,"I hope that Consort Nian's fall from grace
will not reflect on me."
00:09:16.560,00:09:18.430,年妃性子急躁决绝,00:09:17.640,00:09:19.520,Consort Nian is impetuous and ruthless.
00:09:18.920,00:09:21.110,曹姐姐一向日子也不太好过吧,00:09:19.980,00:09:22.280,Your days with her must have been difficult.
00:09:22.480,00:09:23.910,当日木薯粉一事,,,
00:09:24.600,00:09:26.230,姐姐明知本宫是冤枉的,00:09:23.660,00:09:27.340,You knew I was innocent in the cassava starch incident.
00:09:26.800,00:09:29.230,自然也知道是谁利用公主生事,00:09:27.660,00:09:30.540,You must have known who used Princess Wenyi to gain favor.
00:09:30.120,00:09:31.230,可怜温宜公主,00:09:31.120,00:09:32.240,Poor Princess Wenyi.
00:09:31.640,00:09:33.510,小小年纪要受这般苦楚,00:09:32.580,00:09:34.480,It was such torture for her at that age.
00:09:34.160,00:09:35.350,当真叫人心疼,00:09:35.220,00:09:36.600,It makes my heart ache.
00:09:37.080,00:09:37.950,身为母亲,00:09:38.040,00:09:39.160,"As a mother,"
00:09:38.320,00:09:40.510,要看着自己的孩子受这样的苦楚,00:09:39.160,00:09:41.340,"seeing your own child suffer,"
00:09:41.280,00:09:43.110,想必姐姐心里更难受吧,00:09:42.220,00:09:44.180,you must have hurt even more.
00:09:46.000,00:09:48.750,可当年若无年妃的帮助,00:09:46.940,00:09:49.200,"But without Consort Nian’s favor,"
00:09:49.320,00:09:51.270,嫔妾也没有生下公主的命,00:09:49.440,00:09:52.640,I wouldn't have been able to give birth to the Princess.
00:09:52.280,00:09:53.950,知恩图报理所应当,,,
00:09:54.400,00:09:55.310,可后来的种种,00:09:53.480,00:09:55.380,It was reasonable to pay her back for her aid.
00:09:55.600,00:09:57.350,她可是利用姐姐亲生的公主,00:09:55.500,00:09:56.740,But what happened afterward...
00:09:57.760,00:09:59.310,为自己夺取皇上的宠爱,00:09:56.920,00:10:00.240,she used your child to gain favor for herself.
00:10:00.720,00:10:03.280,其实姐姐的聪慧不在年妃之下,00:10:01.860,00:10:04.260,"In fact, you are no less clever than Consort Nian."
00:10:04.000,00:10:06.630,跟随她也不过是想自保而已,00:10:04.920,00:10:07.560,You followed her in the past to protect yourself.
00:10:07.720,00:10:10.630,年妃跋扈 嫔妾也无可奈何,00:10:08.720,00:10:11.280,"Consort Nian is domineering, and I could not defy her."
00:10:11.440,00:10:13.270,好比当日淳贵人落水一事,00:10:12.320,00:10:14.640,"When Noble Lady Chun fell into the water,"
00:10:13.760,00:10:15.870,嫔妾虽有心提醒娘娘相救,00:10:14.880,00:10:16.940,I wanted to warn Your Highness
00:10:16.600,00:10:18.030,却也是于事无补了,00:10:17.420,00:10:19.160,but it was too late to make any difference.
00:10:18.480,00:10:20.750,曹姐姐洞察世事 聪明过人,00:10:19.500,00:10:21.760,"You have a perceptive mind, Lady Cao,"
00:10:21.920,00:10:24.830,所以很早就知晓年妃不可依靠,00:10:22.740,00:10:25.980,and were quick to see that Consort Nian would be unreliable.
00:10:25.520,00:10:27.070,私下也肯帮一帮本宫,00:10:26.400,00:10:28.500,"So, you secretly did me a favor,"
00:10:27.800,00:10:29.470,本宫不是不知恩的人,00:10:28.800,00:10:30.640,I am a person who repays my gratitude.
00:10:33.480,00:10:36.040,嫔妾也只不过是唯命是从,00:10:34.480,00:10:37.240,I could only obey all her orders.
00:10:37.000,00:10:38.030,以嫔妾的心力,,,
00:10:38.520,00:10:40.350,哪敢和当日的年妃相抗,00:10:37.940,00:10:41.680,I did not have the strength to act against her.
00:10:41.400,00:10:44.870,只可惜淳贵人是再也救不回来了,00:10:42.460,00:10:46.200,"Unfortunately, Noble Lady Chun was not saved."
00:10:46.440,00:10:47.790,那么妹妹敢问一句,00:10:47.300,00:10:48.900,"Now I dare to ask,"
00:10:48.760,00:10:51.140,当日淳贵人究竟为何失足,00:10:49.740,00:10:52.280,how did Noble Lady Chun lose her footing?
00:10:52.560,00:10:55.230,姐姐若有忌惮 不说也无妨,00:10:53.420,00:10:56.700,"If you are fearful, you don't have to tell me."
00:10:58.080,00:11:01.230,年妃不过是嫉妒淳贵人年少得宠,00:10:59.140,00:11:02.300,"Consort Nian was jealous that Lady Chun
was favored at such a young age"
00:11:01.760,00:11:02.820,又和娘娘交好,00:11:02.700,00:11:04.240,and was close to Your Highness.
00:11:03.320,00:11:05.750,所以急于剪去娘娘您的羽翼,00:11:04.420,00:11:06.860,She was eager to cut off Your Highness's wings.
00:11:06.320,00:11:08.070,所以她就这样急不可耐吗,00:11:07.260,00:11:09.080,She was that impatient?
00:11:08.880,00:11:10.100,也不怕皇上追究,00:11:09.920,00:11:11.740,She wasn't afraid that His Majesty would investigate?
00:11:11.320,00:11:12.870,年妃向来目中无人,00:11:12.360,00:11:13.920,Consort Nian sees everyone else as beneath her;
00:11:13.440,00:11:15.150,杀个嫔妃又算得了什么,00:11:14.340,00:11:16.240,killing a concubine meant nothing to her.
00:11:15.840,00:11:18.350,何况那样的死法根本不露痕迹,00:11:16.780,00:11:19.680,"Besides, her death left no trace of a suspect."
00:11:19.440,00:11:21.070,淳贵人当日去捡风筝,,,
00:11:21.680,00:11:22.990,是无意中撞见了,00:11:20.620,00:11:22.760,"When Lady Chun looked for her kite, she overheard"
00:11:23.320,00:11:25.750,年妃和年将军的手下私相往来,00:11:22.860,00:11:26.660,"a private meeting between Consort Nian
and General Nian’s subordinate."
00:11:26.200,00:11:27.790,因此才被年妃灭了口,00:11:27.040,00:11:29.580,That's why she was silenced by Consort Nian.
00:11:29.000,00:11:30.990,年妃要见年将军的人,,,
00:11:31.360,00:11:32.230,也是情理之中,00:11:29.960,00:11:33.000,"It is reasonable that Consort Nian wanted
to meet General Nian’s subordinate."
00:11:32.680,00:11:34.110,何必这样偷偷摸摸呢,00:11:33.720,00:11:35.540,Why would they need to meet secretly?
00:11:35.280,00:11:36.750,年妃向来出手阔绰,00:11:36.200,00:11:37.680,Consort Nian's expenditures are very high
00:11:37.440,00:11:39.110,可总有钱银短缺的时候,00:11:38.320,00:11:40.340,but her money is not unlimited.
00:11:40.000,00:11:41.310,她若是要用银子了,00:11:41.060,00:11:42.520,"To increase her income,"
00:11:42.080,00:11:43.790,便将买官之人的名字,,,
00:11:44.240,00:11:46.670,托人偷偷带出宫去交给年大人,00:11:43.160,00:11:47.360,"she passed on the names of those who wished to
buy an official position to General Nian."
00:11:47.280,00:11:48.870,那个赵之垣再受重用,,,
00:11:49.400,00:11:51.830,就是因为贿赂了年妃的关系,00:11:48.200,00:11:53.040,"Zhao Zhiyuan was re-appointed to
another position by bribing Consort Nian."
00:11:52.400,00:11:54.070,她竟敢与年羹尧勾结,,,
00:11:54.880,00:11:55.990,左右朝廷用人,00:11:53.280,00:11:57.540,"How dare she collude with Nian Gengyao
to influence the official appointments in court?"
00:11:56.760,00:12:00.110,是 年羹尧的人又互相勾结,00:11:57.680,00:12:02.960,"And now, these corrupt officials have formed
a faction supporting Nian Genyao."
00:12:00.400,00:12:01.070,结成党羽,,,
00:12:03.320,00:12:05.700,曹姐姐从前不得已才与本宫为敌,00:12:04.080,00:12:06.460,You had no choice in being my enemy in the past.
00:12:06.000,00:12:06.710,情有可原,00:12:06.700,00:12:07.920,it’s understandable.
00:12:07.560,00:12:09.510,曹姐姐诞育公主功劳不小,00:12:08.480,00:12:11.020,"Giving birth to Princess Wenyi is a great
contribution to the imperial family."
00:12:10.440,00:12:11.910,可是在年妃身边多年,00:12:11.340,00:12:13.380,"But after years of supporting Consort Nian,"
00:12:12.960,00:12:14.070,却连一个无知轻狂,,,
00:12:14.480,00:12:16.030,没有子女的丽嫔都不如,00:12:13.920,00:12:17.220,"you were not even on par with
Concubine Beauté who was childless."
00:12:16.680,00:12:17.870,真叫人惋惜,00:12:17.620,00:12:19.000,It's pitiful.
00:12:19.600,00:12:20.910,生母位分的高低,,,
00:12:21.240,00:12:23.110,与子女的前程有很大影响,00:12:20.580,00:12:24.380,A mother’s status impacts her child’s future.
00:12:24.400,00:12:25.750,曹姐姐恐怕还不知,,,
00:12:26.080,00:12:27.510,昨日皇上与本宫说起,00:12:25.320,00:12:28.380,"Perhaps you do not know.
His Majesty told me only yesterday."
00:12:27.840,00:12:30.430,朝瑰公主嫁去准葛尔不过半月,,,
00:12:31.000,00:12:33.190,英格可汗就已暴毙,00:12:28.700,00:12:34.300,"Yingge Khagan was violently murdered less than half a
month after Princess Zhaogui was married to him."
00:12:34.560,00:12:37.070,公主守寡 岂非很快就要回朝,00:12:35.460,00:12:38.160,"Now that the Princess is widowed, will she return soon?"
00:12:37.840,00:12:39.630,能够回朝就是万幸了,00:12:38.660,00:12:40.800,It would be her blessing to return.
00:12:40.360,00:12:42.310,公主要按照准葛尔习俗,,,
00:12:43.000,00:12:44.710,再嫁给新的部落首领,00:12:41.480,00:12:48.020,"The Princess has to follow the
local custom and marry the new khagan."
00:12:45.200,00:12:46.910,也就是即位的新可汗,,,
00:12:47.480,00:12:49.110,这屈辱之事如何使得,00:12:48.460,00:12:50.640,How could this humiliation happen to the Princess?
00:12:49.680,00:12:51.510,女人只为传宗接代,00:12:50.640,00:12:52.740,A woman's sole duty is to continue the family lineage.
00:12:52.240,00:12:54.750,公主再不肯也只能入乡随俗,00:12:53.200,00:12:56.260,"Even though unwilling, she has to follow their custom."
00:12:55.920,00:12:59.230,从王妃之尊降为别人的妾室了,00:12:56.760,00:13:00.480,Falling from a primary wife to a concubine.
00:13:16.600,00:13:18.980,嫔妾愿做牛做马为娘娘效劳,00:13:17.400,00:13:20.160,I will render my humble service to Your Highness!
00:13:19.760,00:13:21.710,但求娘娘庇护嫔妾母女,00:13:20.680,00:13:22.820,I beg Your Highness to protect Princess Wenyi and myself.
00:13:22.280,00:13:23.590,嫔妾感激不尽,00:13:23.180,00:13:24.780,I will be infinitely grateful.
00:13:28.600,00:13:30.750,本宫早就对曹姐姐有敬慕之意,00:13:29.200,00:13:32.280,"I have long admired you, Lady Cao."
00:13:31.640,00:13:33.190,今日总算得以亲近,00:13:32.640,00:13:34.580,"Today, we have become close."
00:13:34.120,00:13:35.390,本宫求之不得,00:13:35.080,00:13:36.900,It is more than I wished for.
00:13:41.720,00:13:42.860,小主若觉得冷,00:13:42.380,00:13:44.000,"If you feel cold, My Lady,"
00:13:43.160,00:13:44.550,就早点去床上卧着,00:13:44.000,00:13:45.480,you can lie down in bed.
00:13:45.040,00:13:46.910,奴婢去给您烫个汤婆子暖上,00:13:45.860,00:13:47.840,I will fill a hot water bottle for you.
00:13:47.120,00:13:50.270,宝鹃 你猜现在别人,00:13:47.840,00:13:48.740,"Coua,"
00:13:51.000,00:13:52.670,是不是都在背后笑话我,00:13:50.000,00:13:53.560,do you think that others are laughing at me now?
00:13:53.480,00:13:54.700,小主 您多心了,00:13:54.580,00:13:56.360,"My Lady, you are overthinking."
00:13:56.240,00:13:58.800,从前我何等风光,00:13:57.060,00:13:59.700,"When I was in high favor,"
00:14:00.200,00:14:02.550,有多少人在背后恨得牙根痒痒,,,
00:14:03.640,00:14:06.550,可现在莞嫔却无声无息地,00:14:01.200,00:14:05.280,people were grinding their teeth with resentment.
00:14:06.880,00:14:07.830,夺了我的宠爱,00:14:06.120,00:14:09.420,"But now, Concubine Sourire has silently stolen my favor"
00:14:09.000,00:14:10.060,人前人后,,,
00:14:10.680,00:14:12.430,也再不像从前那样待我了,00:14:09.980,00:14:13.880,and never treats me the same way as before.
00:14:13.600,00:14:15.070,别人怎么会不笑话我,00:14:14.480,00:14:16.280,How could people not laugh at me?
00:14:15.800,00:14:18.260,皇上只是这几日多召幸莞嫔罢了,00:14:16.660,00:14:19.200,His Majesty has only summoned her a few more times.
00:14:18.920,00:14:20.310,并不曾忘记小主啊,00:14:19.840,00:14:21.360,"His Majesty has not forgotten you, My Lady."
00:14:20.600,00:14:24.430,是吗 皇上总说我歌声动听,00:14:21.460,00:14:22.320,Really?
00:14:26.640,00:14:28.150,原来一有了莞嫔,00:14:23.240,00:14:26.680,His Majesty always said that my voice is soft and delicate.
00:14:29.240,00:14:30.510,却也什么都忘了,00:14:27.320,00:14:31.860,"But now that His Majesty is with Concubine Sourire,
he has forgotten everything else."
00:14:38.640,00:14:40.550,没了鼻子 没了耳朵,00:14:39.480,00:14:41.400,"Without nose, without ears."
00:14:41.560,00:14:44.230,没了手 没了脚,00:14:42.620,00:14:45.300,"Without hands, without feet."
00:14:50.120,00:14:52.500,富察妹妹 你到底怎么了,00:14:52.240,00:14:53.740,"What’s going on, Fuca?"
00:14:54.560,00:14:55.670,我不要做人彘,00:14:55.420,00:14:56.700,I don't want to be a human swine.
00:14:55.880,00:14:57.310,人彘 我不要做人彘,00:14:56.760,00:14:58.400,"- Human swine?
- I don't want to be a human swine."
00:14:57.720,00:14:58.990,是谁想把你做人彘,00:14:58.600,00:14:59.960,Who would do that?
00:14:59.560,00:15:02.070,娘娘 她要把我做人彘,00:15:00.460,00:15:02.800,She wants to make me into a human swine!
00:15:02.320,00:15:03.380,不会的不会的 娘娘救我,,,
00:15:03.720,00:15:04.670,不会的 我看谁敢,00:15:02.800,00:15:04.860,"- It’s impossible.
- Your Highness, help!"
00:15:04.960,00:15:06.790,我不要做人彘 不会的 不会的,00:15:04.980,00:15:06.680,"- No one would dare!
- I don't want to be a human swine!"
,,,00:15:06.680,00:15:07.880,No one would!
00:15:07.520,00:15:10.030,你过来 富察小主到底怎么了,00:15:08.200,00:15:09.160,You!
00:15:10.280,00:15:10.870,也没怎么,00:15:09.720,00:15:10.920,What has happened to Lady Fuca?
00:15:11.160,00:15:12.550,就是前几日和莞嫔娘娘,00:15:11.020,00:15:12.400,"I'm not sure, Your Highness."
00:15:12.880,00:15:13.550,还有曹贵人说话,00:15:12.480,00:15:14.860,"A few days ago, My Lady had a talk with
Concubine Sourire and Lady Cao."
00:15:14.200,00:15:15.420,结果就晕在了里头,,,
00:15:15.840,00:15:18.220,小主一醒来就成了这样,00:15:15.220,00:15:19.600,"She fainted in the pavilion and has been
like this ever since she was revived."
00:15:21.280,00:15:23.910,莞嫔 是莞嫔吓的,00:15:22.080,00:15:23.260,Concubine Sourire ...
00:15:24.480,00:15:26.670,按理说应该不会啊,00:15:23.820,00:15:25.400,Concubine Sourire threatened her?
00:15:27.400,00:15:28.620,曹贵人也在里头,00:15:25.420,00:15:27.620,It makes no sense ...
00:15:29.040,00:15:30.260,可她并没有被吓着,00:15:28.440,00:15:29.700,Lady Cao was there as well.
00:15:31.920,00:15:34.070,我不要做人彘 我不要做人彘,00:15:30.020,00:15:31.440,But she didn’t have such a shock.
00:15:34.680,00:15:35.710,我不要做人彘,00:15:33.920,00:15:35.360,I don't want to become a human swine!
,,,00:15:35.660,00:15:37.120,I don't want to become a human swine!
00:15:47.640,00:15:50.470,小主 富察贵人疯了,00:15:48.720,00:15:51.860,"My Lady, Lady Fuca has lost her mind."
00:15:51.920,00:15:53.750,听说富察贵人回去以后,,,
00:15:54.080,00:15:56.230,便开始发疯 胡言乱语,00:15:52.920,00:15:57.020,"I heard Lady Fuca became insane and started to
talk incoherently after recovering."
00:15:56.840,00:15:59.030,躲在床上不敢出门,00:15:57.680,00:16:00.380,She is afraid to go out and has been hiding in bed.
00:16:00.400,00:16:01.310,皇上知道了吗,,,
00:16:01.760,00:16:02.470,知道,00:16:01.400,00:16:03.680,"- Does His Majesty know of this?
- Yes."
00:16:03.280,00:16:05.030,富察贵人闹得宫中不安,,,
00:16:05.360,00:16:06.500,皇上已经下旨,00:16:04.200,00:16:06.300,Lady Fuca has disrupted the peace of the palace.
00:16:06.880,00:16:09.790,把富察贵人封在宫中不许出门,00:16:06.300,00:16:10.720,"His Majesty has placed an order
confining Lady Fuca to her palace"
00:16:10.240,00:16:12.070,只派了个把太医为她医治,00:16:11.100,00:16:13.620,and has only sent a few imperial doctors to treat her.
00:16:15.040,00:16:16.390,我以为她多厉害呢,00:16:16.200,00:16:17.660,I thought she was strong.
00:16:16.960,00:16:18.710,原来几句话就吓成这个样子,00:16:17.900,00:16:20.080,But just a few words scared away her sanity?
00:16:20.200,00:16:21.340,她是做了亏心事,,,
00:16:21.680,00:16:22.710,自己把自己吓疯了,00:16:21.000,00:16:24.060,"She has a guilty conscience,
and her own fear has driven her insane."
00:16:25.080,00:16:27.870,皇上既说要治 就让她治着,00:16:25.940,00:16:29.980,"Since His Majesty has sent doctors, they will treat her."
00:16:28.240,00:16:28.870,由得她去,,,
00:16:43.400,00:16:44.540,去叩门 是,00:16:44.440,00:16:46.100,"- Go knock on the door.
- Yes."
00:16:57.440,00:16:59.070,小主 外头齐妃来了,,,
00:16:59.440,00:17:00.390,急着要求见小主呢,00:16:58.320,00:17:01.820,"My Lady, Consort Astuce is here
and needs to see you urgently."
00:17:01.400,00:17:02.150,说也奇怪,,,
00:17:02.400,00:17:04.110,齐妃娘娘素来和咱们没往来的,,,
00:17:04.440,00:17:05.580,今儿好好的怎么过来了,00:17:02.280,00:17:06.780,"It's rather strange since Consort Astuce never visits us.
Why would she come today?"
00:17:06.080,00:17:07.110,本宫没空见她,,,
00:17:08.160,00:17:09.190,你且去告诉她,00:17:06.980,00:17:08.540,I don't have time to see her.
00:17:09.920,00:17:11.390,富察贵人的事不会连累她,00:17:09.160,00:17:12.800,"Go tell her she will not be involved
in what happened to Lady Fuca."
00:17:12.840,00:17:14.750,夹竹桃的事情我也不想再追究,00:17:13.780,00:17:15.840,And I will no longer pursue the oleander incident.
00:17:15.280,00:17:16.420,让她自己好自为之吧,,,
00:17:16.840,00:17:17.470,嗻,00:17:16.060,00:17:17.840,Tell her to do whatever she wants.
00:17:24.680,00:17:25.870,小主为人处事,00:17:17.840,00:17:18.800,Yes
00:17:26.600,00:17:28.390,似乎和从前不太一样了,00:17:25.200,00:17:29.500,"My Lady, the way you deal with people
seems different from before."
00:17:28.840,00:17:30.390,从前我便是太好性子,00:17:29.500,00:17:31.600,I was much too mild-natured in the past.
00:17:30.880,00:17:31.750,处处容着她们,,,
00:17:33.160,00:17:34.380,以致我稍见落魄,00:17:31.640,00:17:33.040,I tolerated their actions.
00:17:34.800,00:17:36.230,便个个都敢欺凌到我头上,00:17:34.100,00:17:37.440,It allowed them to walk all over me when my fortune declined.
00:17:38.400,00:17:40.310,如今富察贵人自己吓疯了,,,
00:17:41.040,00:17:42.390,也好给那些人一个警醒,00:17:39.400,00:17:43.440,Lady Fuca's insanity will act as a warning to them.
00:17:43.240,00:17:45.510,本宫也不是一味好欺负的,00:17:43.920,00:17:46.760,I'm no longer easy prey.
00:17:46.880,00:17:50.110,但小主这次还是宽容齐妃,00:17:47.500,00:17:51.360,But you still choose to forgive Consort Astuce this time?
00:17:52.880,00:17:55.550,她虽然狠毒 但也是爱子心切,00:17:53.780,00:17:56.840,"Although she was cruel,
she simply wanted to protect her son."
00:17:57.760,00:17:59.150,富察贵人已经疯了,00:17:58.540,00:18:00.360,Lady Fuca has already gone mad.
00:17:59.720,00:18:01.150,我又何必再苦苦相逼,00:18:00.600,00:18:02.620,There is no need for me to pursue her further.
00:18:01.920,00:18:03.110,给她个警醒就是,00:18:02.660,00:18:04.580,This is enough of a warning for her.
00:18:05.240,00:18:06.950,人说年妃狠辣凌厉,00:18:05.800,00:18:08.000,Everyone says that Consort Nian is aggressive and ruthless.
00:18:07.280,00:18:08.590,铁腕之下人人退避,00:18:08.240,00:18:10.060,They give way before her iron fist.
00:18:10.360,00:18:11.790,可是这些用于对付,,,
00:18:12.120,00:18:13.990,后宫那些异心之人,00:18:11.300,00:18:16.240,Her tactics are effective when dealing with anyone who defies her.
00:18:14.360,00:18:15.230,还是颇有用处的,,,
00:18:16.520,00:18:18.630,所以年妃能够专宠那么多年,,,
00:18:19.040,00:18:20.070,并非一无是处,00:18:17.300,00:18:21.420,"Consort Nian's exclusive favor all these years
has not been without reason."
00:18:20.960,00:18:22.230,年妃处事之风,,,
00:18:22.920,00:18:24.550,我也该取其精华而自用,00:18:21.700,00:18:25.820,I should learn the essence of her methods and use it for myself.
00:18:25.720,00:18:27.790,从前是人为刀姐我为鱼肉,00:18:26.600,00:18:29.180,"I have been ""the fish meat between
the knife and chopping board""."
00:18:28.600,00:18:30.070,今时今日也该换一换了,00:18:29.400,00:18:31.540,Now it's time for a change.
00:18:42.160,00:18:44.070,姐姐这几个福包缝得小巧,00:18:43.000,00:18:45.560,These lucky bags are small and delicate.
00:18:44.840,00:18:46.350,等年三十晚上抓福包,,,
00:18:46.800,00:18:47.750,一手能抓好几个,,,
00:18:48.160,00:18:49.670,明年便是最有福气的人了,00:18:45.700,00:18:50.560,You will be able to grab a handful of these on New Year's Eve and have the greatest fortune for next year.
00:18:50.520,00:18:51.550,那我倒不知道,,,
00:18:51.840,00:18:53.350,你是夸我福包做得好呢,,,
00:18:53.760,00:18:54.870,还是笑我手掌大呢,00:18:51.600,00:18:55.940,"Are you praising my lucky bags,
or teasing me for having large hands?"
00:18:55.440,00:18:56.870,夸你一句便这么多心,00:18:56.200,00:18:58.160,You are not even appreciative when you're complimented.
00:18:57.640,00:18:58.670,都懒得夸你了,00:18:58.440,00:19:00.600,Now I don't want to say any more compliments.
00:19:01.440,00:19:03.070,娘娘 您和贵人要的花线,00:19:02.200,00:19:04.500,"Your Highness, here is the yarn you asked for."
00:19:07.520,00:19:08.230,槿汐姑姑,00:19:08.340,00:19:09.640,Madam Cui.
00:19:09.200,00:19:11.230,敦亲王把御史张霖给打了,00:19:10.180,00:19:12.440,Censor Zhang Lin got beaten up by State Prince Dun.
00:19:11.800,00:19:12.430,什么,,,
00:19:12.680,00:19:13.350,嘀咕什么呢,00:19:12.600,00:19:14.520,"- What?
- What are you talking about?"
00:19:13.960,00:19:14.630,回娘娘,,,
00:19:15.600,00:19:16.710,娘娘 前朝出事了,00:19:14.740,00:19:18.000,"Your Highness, something happened in the imperial court."
00:19:17.320,00:19:18.030,什么事,,,
00:19:18.720,00:19:20.270,敦亲王三天前回京了,00:19:18.100,00:19:19.400,What happened?
00:19:20.760,00:19:22.910,谁知道敦亲王在早朝时,00:19:19.520,00:19:21.360,State Prince Dun came back to Beijing three days ago.
00:19:23.240,00:19:24.630,不仅迟到且戎装进殿,00:19:21.700,00:19:25.400,But he was late to court and arrived in military uniform.
00:19:25.000,00:19:25.910,朝堂不是沙场,,,
00:19:26.240,00:19:27.790,王爷更不是大战得胜归来,00:19:25.660,00:19:27.220,The imperial court is not a battlefield.
00:19:28.400,00:19:30.030,这样穿着戎装姗姗来迟,00:19:27.220,00:19:28.800,And His Lordship had only returned from a small victory.
00:19:30.440,00:19:31.790,可不就是耀武扬威吗,00:19:29.107,00:19:31.207,So arriving late in his military uniform
00:19:32.120,00:19:33.310,结果皇上还没说什么,00:19:31.400,00:19:32.960,— wasn't it swaggering around to show off his power?
00:19:33.640,00:19:35.350,御史张霖大人便出言弹勤,00:19:32.960,00:19:34.500,"Before His Majesty could say anything,"
00:19:35.640,00:19:36.950,奏敦亲王大不敬之罪,00:19:34.520,00:19:38.000,"Zhang Lin, the censor, reprimanded him,
and rebuked him for major disrespect to His Majesty."
00:19:37.440,00:19:38.870,敦亲王性格莽直,,,
00:19:39.400,00:19:41.190,向来就不把开口论孔孟的,00:19:38.220,00:19:40.280,Prince Dun is always reckless.
00:19:41.600,00:19:42.910,文臣儒生放在眼里,00:19:40.507,00:19:43.807,He has always despised civil officials and scholars.
00:19:43.480,00:19:46.110,而言官御史上谏君王之失,00:19:44.207,00:19:47.207,A censor's role is to give advice to the emperor
00:19:46.400,00:19:47.710,下谏群臣之过,,,
00:19:48.120,00:19:49.710,只有他们敢如此,00:19:47.407,00:19:48.907,and point out the wrong-doings of the officials.
00:19:50.040,00:19:51.790,不通情理地弹勤敦亲王了,00:19:49.207,00:19:52.707,Only they would bluntly reprimand State Prince Dun in court.
00:19:52.120,00:19:52.830,贵人说得是,,,
00:19:53.120,00:19:54.590,敦亲王当朝并未发作,00:19:52.800,00:19:54.060,"You're correct, Lady Vertu."
00:19:55.080,00:19:56.910,可是在散朝回府的路上,00:19:54.060,00:19:55.940,State Prince Dun gave no response in court.
00:19:57.240,00:19:58.670,把张霖拦住一通老拳,00:19:55.940,00:19:57.800,"But on the way back,"
00:19:59.000,00:20:00.060,当场就把张霖给打晕了,00:19:57.840,00:20:00.900,"he stopped Zhang Lin, and punched him until he passed out."
00:20:00.240,00:20:00.910,什么,,,
00:20:01.200,00:20:02.910,是啊 老祖宗的规矩嘛,00:20:00.900,00:20:01.880,What?
00:20:03.400,00:20:04.910,言官御史是打不得的,00:20:02.140,00:20:05.900,"Yes, ancient law says no one can assault a censor."
00:20:05.280,00:20:06.830,何况敦亲王有错在先,00:20:06.100,00:20:08.220,"Moreover, State Prince Dun was at fault first."
00:20:07.520,00:20:09.350,这下敦亲王算是犯了众怒了,00:20:08.220,00:20:10.380,"This time, State Prince Dun has made everyone angry."
00:20:09.640,00:20:11.110,眼下朝中的言官文臣,,,
00:20:11.400,00:20:12.990,都在上书要求严惩敦亲王,00:20:10.480,00:20:14.000,"Now all the civil officials are urging
His Majesty to punish him severely"
00:20:13.360,00:20:14.340,以振朝廷法纪,,,
00:20:15.200,00:20:16.510,可敦亲王却不认错,00:20:14.120,00:20:15.800,per the laws of the imperial court.
00:20:16.880,00:20:18.430,这两天称病一直未上朝,00:20:16.080,00:20:17.720,But State Prince Dun refuses to admit any wrongdoings.
00:20:19.440,00:20:20.420,真是荒谬,00:20:17.720,00:20:20.100,"He hasn't attended court for the last
two days, claiming he is sick."
00:20:21.120,00:20:22.590,皇上刚登基时,00:20:20.140,00:20:21.580,This is absurd.
00:20:22.840,00:20:24.790,如何料理了八王和九王的,00:20:21.780,00:20:24.860,Everyone knows how His Majesty dealt with Lord VIII and Lord IX
00:20:25.120,00:20:25.910,咱们都知道,00:20:24.860,00:20:26.840,when His Majesty ascended the throne.
00:20:26.200,00:20:28.110,敦亲王如此地不知高低,00:20:27.020,00:20:29.200,"With State Prince Dun exceeding his bounds,"
00:20:28.520,00:20:31.390,皇上要料理了他倒也不难,00:20:29.360,00:20:32.680,It won't be hard for His Majesty to deal with him.
00:20:32.200,00:20:33.630,皇上若真是要动怒,00:20:33.100,00:20:34.800,"If His Majesty is truly angered,"
00:20:34.160,00:20:35.380,这件事倒不好办了,00:20:34.960,00:20:37.000,then this will become complicated.
00:20:36.360,00:20:38.590,敦亲王刚劳军归来颇得注目,00:20:37.207,00:20:39.707,State Prince Dun has just made a contribution on the battlefield.
00:20:39.080,00:20:40.590,若此时处罚有功之臣,00:20:40.000,00:20:41.700,"If His Majesty punishes him now,"
00:20:41.240,00:20:43.540,怕是皇上在外头的清议会不大好,00:20:41.900,00:20:44.760,I'm afraid it will have a negative impact on His Majesty's reputation.
00:20:43.880,00:20:45.870,可是此事一旦处理得不好,00:20:44.860,00:20:46.900,"But if this doesn't get dealt with properly,"
00:20:46.320,00:20:48.150,便是危及朝廷的大事啊,00:20:47.000,00:20:49.380,it will damage the imperial court.
00:20:48.480,00:20:49.190,贵人明鉴,,,
00:20:49.520,00:20:50.470,就因为这个缘故,00:20:49.400,00:20:50.360,"You're right, Lady Vertu."
00:20:50.840,00:20:51.870,皇上待在养心殿,00:20:50.500,00:20:51.700,It's because of this
00:20:52.200,00:20:53.260,整整一天都没再出来,00:20:51.900,00:20:54.660,"that His Majesty has been staying
in the Hall of Mental Cultivation all day."
00:20:56.360,00:20:58.430,都这个时候了 你去看看吧,00:20:57.000,00:20:59.800,It's getting late. You should go check.
00:21:00.240,00:21:01.070,容我想想,00:21:00.900,00:21:02.720,Let me think first.

00:21:25.080,00:21:25.670,起来吧,,,
00:21:26.000,00:21:26.710,谢皇上,00:21:25.940,00:21:26.980,Rise.
,,,00:21:27.020,00:21:28.600,I thank Your Majesty.
00:21:35.400,00:21:37.780,这几日宫里发生的事,,,
00:21:38.120,00:21:38.990,你都听说了吧,00:21:36.080,00:21:40.000,"You have heard about what has happened
in the palace these last few days?"
00:21:39.440,00:21:42.470,是 此事闹得沸沸扬扬,00:21:40.240,00:21:43.500,"Yes, the news has caused an uproar."
00:21:43.000,00:21:45.270,臣妾虽居后宫 但也略知一二,00:21:43.800,00:21:46.620,"Even though I reside in the harem, I've still heard of it."
00:21:47.480,00:21:48.750,朝政纵然繁忙,,,
00:21:49.120,00:21:51.190,皇上也得保重自己的龙体,00:21:48.360,00:21:50.460,"Despite the many duties of court,"
,,,00:21:50.460,00:21:52.640,Your Majesty must take care your health as well.
00:21:54.280,00:21:56.550,这东阿阿胶 臣妾配了党参炖的,00:21:55.000,00:21:57.820,I stewed Dong'e e-jiao with codonopsis.
00:21:59.880,00:22:02.710,皇上且尝一尝 补气宁神最好了,00:22:00.800,00:22:04.300,"Your Majesty, please have some.
It will supplement qi and help you calm down."
00:22:07.880,00:22:09.830,敦亲王殴打言官一事,,,
00:22:10.240,00:22:11.190,你已经知晓了,00:22:08.700,00:22:12.360,"Since you've already heard about
Prince Dun's assault on a civil official."
00:22:12.160,00:22:14.790,你觉得朕该如何处置,00:22:13.100,00:22:16.160,How do you think I should handle this?
00:22:16.480,00:22:20.430,是否该依律秉公处理责罚敦亲王,00:22:17.300,00:22:21.160,Should I follow the laws and punish State Prince Dun?
00:22:20.880,00:22:22.150,皇上身为一国之君,00:22:21.740,00:22:23.640,"As head of state,"
00:22:22.800,00:22:24.430,当然要依律秉公处理,00:22:23.700,00:22:25.940,Your Majesty should of course follow the laws.
00:22:25.640,00:22:27.110,但不是责罚敦亲王,00:22:26.500,00:22:28.400,But it's not required to punish State Prince Dun.
00:22:27.560,00:22:30.390,朕以为你会主张责罚敦亲王的,00:22:28.600,00:22:31.300,I thought you would suggest punishing him.
00:22:31.240,00:22:32.220,你且说来听听,00:22:32.100,00:22:33.560,Tell me what you think.
00:22:32.800,00:22:34.470,皇上不怪臣妾妄议政事吗,00:22:33.640,00:22:35.640,Your Majesty won't fault me for commenting on state affairs?
00:22:34.840,00:22:37.870,无妨 朕就当是听闲话,00:22:35.980,00:22:38.600,"Don't worry, this is just an informal conversation."
00:22:38.120,00:22:38.790,绝不怪罪,,,
00:22:40.040,00:22:40.990,臣妾以为,00:22:38.840,00:22:40.480,I won't fault you for anything.
00:22:41.640,00:22:43.470,眼下最重要的是安抚人心,00:22:41.040,00:22:42.320,"In my opinion,"
,,,00:22:42.660,00:22:45.440,"in order to resolve the conflicts
between State Prince Dun and the officials,"
00:22:44.640,00:22:46.590,化解敦亲王与朝臣的矛盾,00:22:45.660,00:22:48.140,the most important thing is to pacify both sides.
00:22:48.040,00:22:49.630,两虎相争必有一伤,00:22:49.140,00:22:51.140,"""When two tigers fight, one of them will be harmed."""
00:22:50.320,00:22:51.670,且无论哪一方伤了,00:22:51.380,00:22:53.160,"No matter which side is harmed,"
00:22:52.320,00:22:54.910,归根究底伤的都是大清的根本,00:22:53.340,00:22:56.120,it will ultimately harm the foundation of our nation.
00:22:56.080,00:22:58.270,敦亲王劳军归来颇得注目,00:22:57.060,00:22:59.800,"State Prince Dun has drawn considerable attention
returning from his victory."
00:22:58.960,00:23:00.510,若此时处罚敦亲王,,,
00:23:01.040,00:23:03.950,恐怕会引起朝中武将的不满,00:23:00.160,00:23:05.040,"If Your Majesty punishes His Lordship now,
it will cause discontent among the military officers."
00:23:05.960,00:23:07.670,其实皇上大可不必,,,
00:23:08.040,00:23:10.340,用处罚敦亲王来平息此事,00:23:06.940,00:23:11.460,"However, it is not necessary for Your Majesty to
settle it by punishing State Prince Dun."
00:23:11.800,00:23:13.150,文臣群情激昂,,,
00:23:13.720,00:23:15.110,不过是想要一个说法,00:23:12.920,00:23:14.420,The civil officials are furious about the assault
00:23:16.080,00:23:17.910,皇上给他们一个说法就是了,00:23:14.700,00:23:16.920,but all they are expecting is just a response from Your Majesty.
,,,00:23:17.140,00:23:19.300,And Your Majesty will give them one.
00:23:19.440,00:23:23.630,最好的便是让敦亲王登门致歉,00:23:20.480,00:23:24.760,"It would be best if State Prince Dun would
visit Zhang Lin and apologize to him."
00:23:24.480,00:23:26.670,让敦亲王登门致歉,00:23:25.460,00:23:27.740,Get State Prince Dun to go apologize?
00:23:28.000,00:23:29.390,他那么心高气傲的,,,
00:23:29.880,00:23:31.070,简直还不如杀了他,00:23:29.100,00:23:30.700,He has a strong sense of superiority.
00:23:31.720,00:23:32.700,那也未必了,00:23:30.860,00:23:32.360,It might be easier to just kill him.
,,,00:23:32.660,00:23:34.060,Not necessarily.
00:23:33.400,00:23:35.830,王爷征战沙场为国杀敌,00:23:34.420,00:23:36.980,His Lordship fought the nation's enemies on the battlefields
00:23:36.320,00:23:37.350,也算是个英雄,00:23:37.360,00:23:38.800,and can be deemed a warrior.
00:23:38.520,00:23:41.030,那英雄最难过哪关,00:23:39.480,00:23:41.840,"Of all trials, what is most difficult for a warrior?"
00:23:41.760,00:23:43.590,英雄难过美人关,00:23:42.840,00:23:44.940,"""Beautiful women are the most difficult trial for a warrior."""
00:23:44.560,00:23:45.750,你这个机灵鬼啊,,,
00:23:46.160,00:23:47.630,亏你能想得出这个招来,00:23:45.620,00:23:48.360,"Only you would think of that, smarty-pants."
00:23:48.000,00:23:50.110,皇上也知道英雄难过美人关啊,00:23:48.920,00:23:51.580,"Your Majesty definitely knows ""beautiful women
are the most difficult trial for a warrior."""
00:23:51.360,00:23:53.430,臣妾哪里懂得什么国家大事,00:23:52.460,00:23:54.480,I know nothing about state governance.
00:23:53.960,00:23:55.470,知道的不过是些,,,
00:23:55.800,00:23:57.310,妯娌间鸡毛蒜皮的事,00:23:54.920,00:23:58.700,"I know only trivial family things

00:23:59.280,00:24:00.590,王爷敬畏福晋,,,
00:24:01.160,00:24:02.790,此事若由福晋出马,00:24:00.340,00:24:02.100,State Prince Dun holds his wife in high esteem.
00:24:03.280,00:24:04.590,自然是无往而不利的,00:24:02.160,00:24:05.720,"If we put Her Ladyship to the task,
I believe she can bring His Lordship around."
00:24:06.240,00:24:08.110,臣妾曾与福晋有过数面之缘,00:24:07.280,00:24:09.260,I've encountered Her Ladyship a few times
00:24:08.560,00:24:09.670,知道她并不是一个,,,
00:24:09.960,00:24:10.940,悍妒无知的妇人,00:24:09.600,00:24:12.080,and I know she's not a small-minded woman.
00:24:12.120,00:24:15.590,那你说谁去劝敦亲王福晋呢,00:24:13.060,00:24:14.440,So who do you think
,,,00:24:14.820,00:24:17.000,should be sent to persuade his wife?
00:24:16.560,00:24:18.790,皇上若不嫌弃臣妾无能,00:24:17.660,00:24:19.780,"If Your Majesty doesn't regard me as incompetent,"
00:24:19.200,00:24:21.660,那臣妾就自告奋勇了,00:24:20.240,00:24:22.560,I will accept this duty.
00:24:23.520,00:24:24.580,后宫之中,00:24:24.560,00:24:26.060,"In the entire harem,"
00:24:25.160,00:24:28.190,只有你能为朕排忧解难,00:24:26.180,00:24:29.080,only you can soothe my worries.
00:24:29.720,00:24:32.790,朕的那些大臣们拿着朕的体禄,00:24:30.720,00:24:33.660,"All these stipend-provided officials,"
00:24:33.720,00:24:34.830,哄闹了半天,00:24:34.820,00:24:36.600,"after half a day of clamor,"
00:24:35.800,00:24:38.310,却只能出些罚与不罚的主意,00:24:36.940,00:24:39.440,"could only come up with ideas
to either punish him or not."
00:24:38.560,00:24:40.230,当真是无用之极,00:24:39.440,00:24:41.380,They are more useful than nothing.
00:24:41.040,00:24:43.340,臣妾只是后宫中一介区区妇人,00:24:41.940,00:24:44.280,I'm just a woman in Your Majesty's harem.
00:24:44.320,00:24:45.870,哪里是臣妾的主意,00:24:45.360,00:24:47.220,"This is not my own idea,"
00:24:47.080,00:24:48.550,不过是皇上的心意,,,
00:24:49.040,00:24:50.710,侥幸被臣妾猜中了而已,00:24:48.160,00:24:51.620,"but instead, an idea Your Majesty had which I guessed correctly."
00:24:51.840,00:24:54.400,那些大臣们熟悉的是书本伦理,00:24:52.940,00:24:55.420,The officials are familiar with books and ethics
00:24:54.840,00:24:57.350,可臣妾熟悉的却是皇上,00:24:55.880,00:24:58.340,but I understand Your Majesty.
00:24:58.760,00:24:59.670,皇上的天意,,,
00:25:00.160,00:25:01.670,臣妾还是能揣测几分的,00:24:59.800,00:25:01.400,I am able to make some conjectures about
,,,00:25:01.400,00:25:03.180,the intent of Heaven within Your Majesty.
00:25:02.680,00:25:07.190,嬛嬛 只有你最懂朕的心意,00:25:03.800,00:25:05.140,"Huan Huan,"
00:25:08.960,00:25:10.550,可是敦亲王这个样子,00:25:05.640,00:25:08.080,only you understand my heart.
00:25:11.160,00:25:12.350,迟早是留不得的,00:25:09.980,00:25:11.900,"But if State Prince Dun is set in his ways,"
00:25:14.560,00:25:16.030,敦亲王若一味跋扈,00:25:12.120,00:25:13.780,"at some point, it might not serve to keep him."
00:25:16.480,00:25:17.590,皇上若有此心,00:25:15.600,00:25:17.360,If  State Prince Dun keeps being imperious
00:25:18.360,00:25:20.110,那便是江山黎民之大幸,00:25:17.540,00:25:19.120,"and Your Majesty makes that decision,"
,,,00:25:19.320,00:25:21.460,it will be a great fortune for the people.
00:25:20.760,00:25:21.590,但现在,00:25:21.720,00:25:22.820,But now
00:25:22.120,00:25:24.070,还不是能除去敦亲王的时候,00:25:23.220,00:25:25.140,it would not be beneficial to remove him.
00:25:25.720,00:25:26.390,没错,00:25:26.660,00:25:27.800,You're right.
00:25:27.600,00:25:31.630,朕决意 待此事有所平息之后,00:25:28.520,00:25:32.940,"I resolve to appoint your father to an
important position at the Censorate"
00:25:32.400,00:25:35.750,让你父亲任都察院要职,00:25:33.400,00:25:36.640,after this incident has been settled.
00:25:36.400,00:25:38.270,可替朕弹勤百官,00:25:37.420,00:25:39.620,So he can denounce officials at any level.
00:25:39.400,00:25:40.510,光你父亲还不够,00:25:40.260,00:25:41.620,"Not only your father,"
00:25:40.960,00:25:42.990,那些不与敦亲王和年羹尧,,,
00:25:43.320,00:25:44.870,亲近的有才之臣,00:25:41.960,00:25:45.140,I will keep an eye out to also promote any talented official
00:25:45.720,00:25:47.270,朕都要着意提拔,00:25:45.140,00:25:48.900,"who refuses to align themselves with
State Prince Dun and Nian Gengyao."
00:25:47.880,00:25:51.750,只是此事现在还不好打草惊蛇,00:25:48.900,00:25:52.660,"To avoid ""beating the grass and startling the snakes,"""
00:25:52.400,00:25:54.830,所以颇有踌躇之处,00:25:53.420,00:25:55.820,I'm still undecided about a few things.
00:25:55.600,00:25:56.710,若说安抚,,,
00:25:57.680,00:25:58.820,敦亲王与福晋,00:25:56.520,00:25:58.200,"In terms of appeasing State Prince Dun,"
00:25:59.120,00:26:00.950,早已是赏无可赏的富贵,,,
00:26:01.560,00:26:03.110,加无可加的贵重了,00:25:58.780,00:26:03.940,"he and his wife already hold the greatest wealth and the highest distinction, what further awards could I grant?"
00:26:04.520,00:26:05.910,可怜天下父母心,00:26:05.500,00:26:07.680,"""Pity the hearts and devotions of all parents under Heaven."""
00:26:06.880,00:26:07.830,看来,00:26:08.000,00:26:09.280,It seems that
00:26:08.720,00:26:10.790,也只有在他们子女身上下功夫了,00:26:09.720,00:26:12.120,we can only put some thought into their children.
00:26:11.600,00:26:15.110,敦亲王福晋生有一子一女,00:26:12.700,00:26:16.020,He and his wife have a son and a daughter.
00:26:16.040,00:26:18.230,长女为庆成郡主,00:26:17.140,00:26:19.400,"Their daughter holds the title of
Venerable Princess of Qingcheng [the third rank]"
00:26:18.800,00:26:21.870,朕有意破例封她为和硕公主,00:26:19.800,00:26:23.320,"and I intend to make an exception and grant her
the title of Noble Princess [the second rank],"
00:26:22.960,00:26:24.990,位同嫔妃所生之女,00:26:24.020,00:26:26.540,the same rank as the daughters of an emperor's concubines.
00:26:26.160,00:26:28.990,然后再封敦亲王之子为贝子,00:26:27.120,00:26:29.880,"And I will grant his son the title of
Banner Prince [the fourth rank]"
00:26:29.360,00:26:30.230,以承父业,00:26:30.220,00:26:31.800,so he can inherit his father's honors.
00:26:31.240,00:26:33.510,皇上英明 事事思虑周全,00:26:32.080,00:26:34.620,Your Majesty is wise and thoughtful.
00:26:34.840,00:26:37.790,不过臣妾以为不仅要封公主,00:26:35.860,00:26:39.060,"But in my humble opinion, Venerable Princess of
Qingcheng should not only be promoted"
00:26:38.600,00:26:39.660,连封号也要改,00:26:39.660,00:26:41.280,but also granted a new honorary name.
00:26:40.840,00:26:44.230,就拟定恭定二字,00:26:41.960,00:26:45.320,"We can propose the title ""Noble Princess
Gongding"" [reverent and stable]"
00:26:45.760,00:26:48.790,也好时时提醒她父亲恭敬安定,00:26:46.660,00:26:49.700,to remind her father of reverence and stability.
00:26:49.880,00:26:50.630,自然了,,,
00:26:51.320,00:26:52.630,皇上是想不动干戈,00:26:50.800,00:26:51.820,"Of course,"
00:26:52.920,00:26:54.310,化解兄弟间睨墙之祸,00:26:52.480,00:26:55.340,Your Majesty wishes to resolve the quarrel with your brother
00:26:55.160,00:26:55.910,那就看王爷,,,
00:26:56.320,00:26:57.950,能不能领会皇上天恩了,00:26:56.180,00:26:59.260,"but we need to see whether or not
His Lordship appreciates Heaven's grace."
00:26:59.400,00:27:01.910,并且公主还要教养于宫中,00:27:00.400,00:27:02.940,The princess should also be brought to the palace
00:27:02.320,00:27:03.190,由太后抚养,,,
00:27:04.200,00:27:05.310,将来若有不测,00:27:03.260,00:27:04.980,and placed under the care of the Empress Dowager.
00:27:05.760,00:27:07.710,也好暂时挟制敦亲王,00:27:05.260,00:27:06.620,"If something unforeseen happens in the future,"
,,,00:27:06.760,00:27:09.060,it will restrain State Prince Dun temporarily.
00:27:09.560,00:27:12.150,没错 就按你说的办,00:27:10.740,00:27:13.260,"Absolutely, we will do what you suggest."
00:27:13.200,00:27:15.470,朕即刻拟旨就是,00:27:14.220,00:27:16.760,I will start drafting the decree immediately.
00:27:19.480,00:27:20.870,你方才跟朕说什么,00:27:20.160,00:27:22.100,What were you saying earlier ...
00:27:22.440,00:27:24.550,英雄难过美人关,00:27:23.580,00:27:26.080, Beautiful women are the most difficult trial for a warrior?
00:27:27.160,00:27:28.750,皇上惯会取笑臣妾,00:27:28.360,00:27:30.380,Your Majesty is teasing me.
00:27:30.280,00:27:32.190,臣妾哪里算得上什么美人呢,00:27:31.400,00:27:33.520,I'm not a beautiful woman at all.
00:27:36.720,00:27:37.310,皇上,,,
00:27:37.520,00:27:38.150,什么事,00:27:37.700,00:27:39.280,"- Your Majesty.
- What is it?"
00:27:38.680,00:27:40.630,您今晚点了安贵人侍寝,00:27:39.760,00:27:41.580,You selected Lady An for tonight.
00:27:41.160,00:27:41.910,安贵人那儿,,,
00:27:42.240,00:27:43.750,也已经几次派人来问了,00:27:42.300,00:27:44.720,Lady An has sent over a few servants to confirm.
00:27:44.240,00:27:46.670,你告诉她 今晚不用过来了,00:27:45.280,00:27:47.740,Tell her that she won't need to come here tonight.
00:27:47.160,00:27:48.030,早点歇息吧,00:27:48.140,00:27:49.660,Tell her to go to sleep early.
00:27:52.640,00:27:54.430,安妹妹刚得皇上宠幸不久,,,
00:27:54.960,00:27:56.550,正该是多多垂怜的时候,00:27:53.720,00:27:55.760,Lingrong has only just recently gained favor from Your Majesty.
00:27:57.040,00:27:58.100,怎好让她空等呢,00:27:56.060,00:27:57.640,Your Majesty should be more caring for her.
00:27:59.120,00:28:00.180,臣妾先告退了,00:27:58.000,00:27:59.600,Don't make her wait in vain.
00:28:02.800,00:28:03.710,先不许走,00:28:00.200,00:28:01.740,Allow me to take my leave.
00:28:04.800,00:28:05.670,不知安妹妹,00:28:03.840,00:28:05.120,Don't go yet.
00:28:06.080,00:28:08.070,正怎么眼巴巴盼着皇上驾临呢,00:28:05.840,00:28:09.240,"I wonder how eagerly Lingrong
has been anticipating Your Majesty."
00:28:09.000,00:28:10.710,皇上九五之尊一言九鼎,00:28:10.120,00:28:12.040,"Your Majesty's words ""carry the weight of nine dings""
[bronze ritual vessels]"
00:28:11.240,00:28:12.790,可不能失信于小女子了,00:28:12.300,00:28:14.360,"You can't ""eat your words"" when it comes to women."
00:28:14.400,00:28:15.790,可是朕想你在,00:28:15.180,00:28:17.100,But I want to have you here.
00:28:19.640,00:28:21.830,臣妾只要皇上心里有臣妾就好,00:28:20.500,00:28:22.740,As long as Your Majesty has me in your heart.
00:28:22.440,00:28:23.420,臣妾怎么会,00:28:23.360,00:28:24.620,Why would I
00:28:24.120,00:28:25.990,与安妹妹争朝夕之长短呢,00:28:25.180,00:28:27.500,contend with Lingrong for a day or night?
00:28:30.840,00:28:32.030,回去的时候小心点,00:28:31.920,00:28:33.660,Take care on your way back.
00:28:33.840,00:28:34.900,臣妾先告退了,00:28:34.920,00:28:36.500,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:28:51.800,00:28:53.710,小主 安小主过去了,00:28:52.840,00:28:55.520,"My Lady, Lady An just passed by."
00:29:10.480,00:29:13.270,谁侍寝都不要紧 要紧的是,00:29:11.260,00:29:13.360,It doesn't matter who His Majesty stays with
00:29:14.080,00:29:15.790,我能不能握住皇上的心,00:29:13.540,00:29:14.900,"but instead,"
00:29:18.520,00:29:19.230,槿汐,00:29:15.160,00:29:17.080,who his heart stays with.
00:29:20.400,00:29:21.460,你和流朱 浣碧,00:29:19.580,00:29:20.440,Jinxi
00:29:22.280,00:29:22.950,好好准备后日,,,
00:29:23.320,00:29:24.750,敦亲王福晋进宫的事吧,00:29:21.340,00:29:25.880,"You, Jade and Vermillion must prepare for the visit of
State Prince Dun's wife to the palace in two days."
00:29:25.680,00:29:26.390,知道了,00:29:26.780,00:29:28.000,Understood.
00:29:37.400,00:29:38.870,皇后娘娘吉祥,00:29:38.340,00:29:39.820,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:29:39.640,00:29:40.510,快起来吧,,,
00:29:40.800,00:29:41.830,谢皇后娘娘,00:29:40.654,00:29:41.524,Rise.
,,,00:29:41.616,00:29:42.887,I thank Your Majesty.
00:29:47.240,00:29:48.630,莞嫔娘娘吉祥,00:29:48.180,00:29:49.600,Peace to Your Highness.
00:29:51.640,00:29:53.310,赐座 上茶,00:29:52.620,00:29:54.620,"Have a seat. Autumn, bring some tea."
00:29:53.800,00:29:54.430,是,00:29:54.820,00:29:55.560,Yes.
00:29:55.480,00:29:56.670,绘春 上茶,00:29:56.420,00:29:57.620,"Spring, serve the tea."
00:30:04.920,00:30:06.630,莞嫔娘娘身子痊愈了,,,
00:30:07.200,00:30:08.510,妾身恭喜娘娘,00:30:05.865,00:30:09.455,I congratulate Your Highness on your full recovery.
00:30:09.360,00:30:11.710,数月前见福晋进宫朝贺,00:30:10.305,00:30:12.655,"When Your Ladyship visited a few months ago
to pay your respects to His Majesty,"
00:30:12.040,00:30:13.590,很想和福晋交谈几句,00:30:12.985,00:30:14.535,I wanted to talk with you.
00:30:14.520,00:30:16.350,只可惜有事在身耽误了,00:30:15.465,00:30:17.612,Sadly I was too busy and missed the chance.
00:30:16.920,00:30:17.750,真是遗憾,00:30:17.865,00:30:18.695,What a shame.
00:30:18.240,00:30:19.350,娘娘金贵之身,00:30:19.180,00:30:20.560,Your Highness was with child.
00:30:19.640,00:30:21.750,妾身怎敢胡乱越众扰了娘娘,00:30:20.580,00:30:22.900,I dared not disturb Your Highness.
00:30:23.160,00:30:24.510,论纲常是这么说,00:30:24.100,00:30:25.840,"Perhaps according to traditional ethics,"
00:30:25.080,00:30:25.910,可是论家理,00:30:26.020,00:30:27.400,but according to family ethics
00:30:26.480,00:30:29.070,本宫还得称福晋一声十弟妹呢,00:30:27.420,00:30:30.020,you are my sister.
00:30:29.680,00:30:32.350,本就是自家人 就该亲亲热热的,00:30:30.620,00:30:33.480,"We are all family, so we can treat each other intimately."
00:30:32.720,00:30:34.990,娘娘这么说是妾身的福气呀,00:30:33.660,00:30:35.940,I am honored by Your Highness's kind words.
00:30:36.720,00:30:38.950,皇后娘娘近来气色可真是好,00:30:37.660,00:30:40.080,Your Majesty has been looking very well lately.
00:30:40.160,00:30:41.910,福晋真是会说话,00:30:41.100,00:30:43.060,That's very kind of you.
00:30:43.000,00:30:44.550,本宫倒是瞧着福晋,,,
00:30:44.840,00:30:47.830,生了弘暄贝子之后精神更好了呢,00:30:43.940,00:30:48.780,"After giving birth to Banner Prince Hongxuan,
you somehow look even more vibrant."
00:30:48.120,00:30:48.750,贝子,00:30:48.820,00:30:50.020,Banner Prince?
00:30:49.440,00:30:51.270,皇后娘娘是在打趣妾身吗,00:30:50.380,00:30:52.380,Is Your Majesty teasing me?
00:30:52.000,00:30:54.790,弘暄才六岁 怎么可能是贝子呢,00:30:52.940,00:30:55.740,"Hongxuan is only six years old
How could he be a Banner Prince?"
00:30:55.120,00:30:56.950,所以这才是皇上的隆恩哪,00:30:56.060,00:30:58.020,Such is His Majesty's grace.
00:30:58.400,00:31:01.230,皇上在子侄中最喜欢弘暄,00:30:59.340,00:31:02.180,His Majesty loves Hongxuan the most out of his nephews.
00:31:01.840,00:31:04.910,弘暄虽然年幼 却是聪颖可爱,00:31:02.785,00:31:05.855,"Hongxuan may be young, but he is intelligent and adorable."
00:31:05.880,00:31:09.150,所以皇上想尽早册封他为贝子,00:31:06.825,00:31:10.095,"It was His Majesty's idea to bestow
the title of Banner Prince upon him early."
00:31:09.640,00:31:10.910,好好加以教养,00:31:10.585,00:31:12.087,"With careful guidance,"
00:31:11.240,00:31:13.350,日后也能跟他的父王一样,00:31:12.140,00:31:14.380,"one day he may be like his father,"
00:31:13.640,00:31:16.020,安邦定国 兴盛大清,00:31:14.520,00:31:17.320,bringing peace and prosperity to the Great Qing.
00:31:18.240,00:31:20.870,妾身替弘暄谢皇上隆恩,00:31:19.180,00:31:21.820,I thank His Majesty in Hongxuan's stead.
00:31:21.400,00:31:22.540,还不止呢,00:31:22.345,00:31:23.485,That's not all.
00:31:22.840,00:31:24.590,皇上的意思是好事成双,00:31:23.715,00:31:25.632,His Majesty has good news coming in a pair.
00:31:25.040,00:31:28.030,还要破例封庆成郡主为公主,00:31:25.994,00:31:29.183,"He will grant Venerable Princess of Qingcheng
the title of Noble Princess"
00:31:28.920,00:31:31.380,就尊为和硕恭定公主,00:31:29.860,00:31:32.380,with the honorary name Noble Princess Gongding.
00:31:31.800,00:31:34.100,以后由太后亲自抚养,00:31:32.740,00:31:35.320,The Empress Dowager will be taking care of her from now on.
00:31:35.480,00:31:36.830,谢皇上隆恩,00:31:36.420,00:31:38.200,I thank His Majesty's heavenly grace.
00:31:37.720,00:31:40.870,可是郡主才十二岁 尚不懂事,00:31:38.660,00:31:41.820,"However, the princess is only twelve years old."
00:31:41.240,00:31:43.430,妾身怕如果现在交给太后抚养,,,
00:31:43.800,00:31:45.150,会扰了太后的清静,00:31:42.055,00:31:46.164,I'm afraid she would cause trouble for the Empress Dowager.
00:31:46.320,00:31:48.350,不如请皇上收回成命,00:31:47.260,00:31:49.540,Perhaps His Majesty might reconsider his decree.
00:31:51.200,00:31:52.790,皇上膝下子女不多,00:31:52.240,00:31:54.160,His Majesty has few children.
00:31:53.400,00:31:55.190,郡主入宫抚养是喜事,00:31:54.345,00:31:56.135,This is a good thing for the Venerable Princess.
00:31:56.080,00:31:57.220,大清开国以来,,,
00:31:57.560,00:31:58.750,虽都有封亲王之女,00:31:57.020,00:31:58.440,"Over the course of the Qing Dynasty,"
00:31:59.160,00:32:00.270,为和硕公主的例子,00:31:58.440,00:32:01.160,"other princesses have been given the title Noble Princess as well,"
00:32:00.960,00:32:03.390,那也是成婚之际照顾夫家门媚,00:32:01.900,00:32:04.400,but only right before marriage to honor their husbands.
00:32:03.800,00:32:06.030,像郡主一般年少册封的,00:32:04.740,00:32:07.160,His Majesty has established a new precedent
00:32:06.400,00:32:08.390,在咱们皇上手里还是第一例呢,00:32:07.340,00:32:10.160,"by granting the title of Noble Princess
to someone of such a young age."
00:32:09.680,00:32:12.110,好了 本宫有些困了,00:32:10.620,00:32:13.060,All right. I am a little weary.
00:32:13.400,00:32:14.670,福晋请回吧,00:32:14.345,00:32:15.726,Please take your leave.
00:32:18.280,00:32:19.550,皇上的圣旨,,,
00:32:19.840,00:32:22.030,今天晚上就会传到府上了,00:32:19.404,00:32:23.151,"His Majesty's decree will be
delivered to your residence tonight."
00:32:27.840,00:32:29.150,臣妾恭送娘娘,00:32:28.780,00:32:30.360,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:32:34.000,00:32:36.350,时候不早了 臣妾先行告退了,00:32:34.940,00:32:37.380,It's getting late. I will be taking my leave.
00:32:47.280,00:32:48.150,莞嫔娘娘,00:32:48.220,00:32:49.640,Your Highness.
00:32:53.080,00:32:54.110,天色还早,00:32:54.020,00:32:55.420,It is not that late yet.
00:32:54.760,00:32:56.670,妾身想到娘娘的宫里坐坐,00:32:55.700,00:32:57.620,I would like to visit Your Highness's palace.
00:32:57.480,00:32:59.830,不知道是否会扰了娘娘,00:32:58.425,00:33:00.775,Would that be too much trouble?
00:33:00.800,00:33:01.780,福晋客气了,00:33:01.740,00:33:03.020,Your Ladyship need not stand on ceremony.
00:33:02.400,00:33:04.310,最喜欢福晋这样不请自来的,,,
00:33:04.880,00:33:06.270,要不反倒显得生分了,00:33:03.340,00:33:07.520,"I welcome guests who invite themselves.
We are family, not strangers."
00:33:07.600,00:33:08.190,请,00:33:08.540,00:33:09.140,Please come.
00:33:12.720,00:33:13.350,请,00:33:13.665,00:33:14.295,Please.
00:33:31.520,00:33:32.790,这茶是雪顶含翠,00:33:32.465,00:33:33.735,"This tea is called ""snow-drop jade""."
00:33:33.280,00:33:34.790,刚五百里加急送过来的,00:33:34.225,00:33:35.735,It just arrived on the fastest courier.
00:33:35.320,00:33:37.110,福晋尝尝 可还能入口吗,00:33:36.260,00:33:38.500,"Please try some and see
if it's deserving of Your Ladyship's liking."
00:33:45.440,00:33:47.430,如今宫中娘娘最得圣意,00:33:46.380,00:33:48.520,Your Highness holds His Majesty's highest favor in the palace.
00:33:47.840,00:33:49.430,自然样样都是最好的,00:33:48.780,00:33:50.760,"Naturally, Your Highness has the best of everything."
00:33:50.200,00:33:52.310,当日本宫小产之后备受冷落,00:33:51.140,00:33:53.260,"When I had my miscarriage,"
00:33:52.960,00:33:55.150,惟有福晋不避前嫌来看望本宫,00:33:53.934,00:33:56.243,"Your Ladyship were the only one to visit me, despite my status."
00:33:55.920,00:33:57.390,本宫一直铭记在心,00:33:56.920,00:33:58.580,I will always remember that.
00:33:58.040,00:33:59.070,希望有朝一日,,,
00:33:59.400,00:34:01.670,可以回报福晋雪中送炭之情,00:33:58.980,00:34:02.940,"I hope a day comes when I can repay Your Ladyship
for your heart-warming kindness."
00:34:02.320,00:34:04.750,娘娘愿意替妾身去劝劝皇上吗,00:34:03.260,00:34:05.800,Will Your Highness put in a word to His Majesty for me?
00:34:06.760,00:34:08.390,本宫为福晋考虑,00:34:07.920,00:34:09.560,"If I were you,"
00:34:09.240,00:34:11.870,还请福晋能够遵从圣旨,00:34:10.185,00:34:12.815,I would accept His Majesty's decree.
00:34:12.440,00:34:13.630,由太后抚养公主,00:34:13.380,00:34:15.120,Let Empress Dowager take care of the princess.
00:34:16.320,00:34:17.540,这话怎么说呢,00:34:17.260,00:34:19.120,Why does Your Highness say so?
00:34:20.240,00:34:22.110,福晋既为人母也为人妻,00:34:21.180,00:34:23.060,"As both a wife and a mother,"
00:34:22.520,00:34:23.470,自然时时事事,,,
00:34:23.840,00:34:25.390,都要为夫君子女打算,00:34:23.465,00:34:26.370,"of course Your Ladyship must always
think of your husband and children,"
00:34:25.720,00:34:26.510,以他们为先,,,
00:34:26.920,00:34:27.900,福晋说是不是,00:34:26.479,00:34:27.754,and place their interests above your own.
,,,00:34:27.820,00:34:29.460,Wouldn't Your Ladyship agree?
00:34:29.920,00:34:32.150,前几日为了王爷殴打言官一事,00:34:30.860,00:34:33.060,"Prince Dun attacked a court official a few days ago,"
00:34:32.520,00:34:33.660,激起了不少民愤,00:34:33.400,00:34:35.140,and caused an uproar among the other officials.
00:34:34.360,00:34:38.270,希望王爷可以登门向张霖致歉,00:34:35.340,00:34:39.260,"Hopefully Prince Dun will consider
visiting Zhang Lin and apologizing to him."
00:34:39.720,00:34:41.110,王爷的脾气性子,,,
00:34:41.440,00:34:42.910,只有别人去求他的,00:34:40.740,00:34:42.160,"With a temper like his,"
00:34:43.440,00:34:44.830,哪有他求别人的呢,00:34:42.260,00:34:45.780,he would never apologize to someone else.
00:34:45.120,00:34:46.180,福晋若顾念王爷,00:34:45.940,00:34:47.300,"If Your Ladyship cares for Prince Dun,"
00:34:46.680,00:34:49.110,就得在这件事上好好劝一劝王爷,00:34:47.600,00:34:50.040,you must try and persuade him.
00:34:50.280,00:34:52.070,皇上虽说要维护王爷,00:34:51.300,00:34:53.320,"His Majesty wants to shield Prince Dun,"
00:34:52.560,00:34:54.430,可毕竟是王爷先动手打了人,00:34:53.620,00:34:55.540,but ultimately it is Prince Dun who was at fault.
00:34:55.000,00:34:55.630,那张霖,,,
00:34:55.920,00:34:57.790,到现在还躺在床上起不来呢,00:34:55.940,00:34:58.740,Zhang Lin is still unable to get out of bed.
00:34:58.760,00:35:00.350,皇上终究生气啊,00:34:59.860,00:35:01.680,"His Majesty is upset, after all."
00:35:01.640,00:35:05.030,而且王爷性格耿直 难免结怨,00:35:02.560,00:35:06.080,"Prince Dun has a straightforward nature
and may stir up tensions again in the future."
00:35:06.200,00:35:07.070,若有公主,,,
00:35:07.480,00:35:09.470,时时能在皇上面前劝说几句,00:35:07.164,00:35:10.678,"If the princess is in the palace, she will be able to
speak to His Majesty in times of strife."
00:35:10.160,00:35:10.990,岂不更好,00:35:11.100,00:35:12.400,Wouldn't that be a good thing?
00:35:11.800,00:35:13.150,本宫也会对皇上说,00:35:12.740,00:35:14.240,I will also suggest to His Majesty
00:35:13.840,00:35:17.030,能让福晋常常进后宫看望公主,00:35:14.785,00:35:17.975,"that you be allowed to come to the palace
frequently to visit the princess."
00:35:17.640,00:35:18.470,这可好啊,00:35:18.580,00:35:19.980,What does Your Ladyship think?
00:35:21.600,00:35:24.350,既然皇上如此费心周全,00:35:22.540,00:35:25.420,"Since His Majesty has put so much thought into this,"
00:35:25.080,00:35:28.150,妾身和王爷也不能不领这个情了,00:35:26.020,00:35:29.100,His Lordship and I cannot refuse his grace.
00:35:29.320,00:35:30.230,多谢娘娘,00:35:30.260,00:35:31.360,I thank Your Highness.
00:35:33.480,00:35:34.190,喝口茶吧,00:35:34.420,00:35:35.740,"Please, have some tea."
00:35:39.160,00:35:40.910,什么叫望眼欲穿,00:35:40.240,00:35:42.300,I've finally learned
00:35:42.000,00:35:43.550,本宫算是体会到了,00:35:43.040,00:35:44.780,"what it means to ""anxiously await
something until one's eyes hurt""."
00:35:45.160,00:35:47.150,娘娘 您不要这样说,00:35:46.220,00:35:48.360,"Your Highness, please don't say that."
00:35:50.240,00:35:52.390,不知道本宫这样看着,00:35:51.120,00:35:53.060,I wonder when
00:35:53.320,00:35:55.030,能不能把皇上盼来,00:35:54.220,00:35:56.260,I will be able to see His Majesty again.
00:35:56.080,00:35:56.950,娘娘放心,00:35:57.040,00:35:58.280,Your Highness need not worry.
00:35:57.240,00:35:59.590,年大将军已经叫人进来传话说,00:35:58.320,00:36:00.460,Great General Nian has sent a messenger.
00:35:59.960,00:36:01.910,知道娘娘在宫里受了冷待,00:36:00.900,00:36:03.140,"He is aware that Your Highness has been treated coldly recently,"
00:36:02.240,00:36:03.830,已经和敦亲王约好了,,,
00:36:04.240,00:36:05.910,要试探皇上的心意呢,00:36:03.240,00:36:06.780,"and has made plans with State Prince Dun
to probe His Majesty's affections toward Your Highness."
00:36:06.320,00:36:07.790,本宫不是跟你说了,00:36:07.360,00:36:08.860,I have already told you
00:36:08.160,00:36:10.590,不要跟哥哥提本宫和皇上的事吗,00:36:09.180,00:36:11.360,not to bring this up with my brother.
00:36:11.520,00:36:13.390,就算娘娘和奴婢不提,00:36:12.500,00:36:14.500,Even if we were not to raise it with him
00:36:14.280,00:36:15.870,可是皇上冷落娘娘,,,
00:36:16.120,00:36:18.070,也是宫里人尽皆知的事啊,00:36:15.320,00:36:19.080,"everyone in the palace knows how His Majesty
is treating Your Highness right now."
00:36:18.520,00:36:20.070,怎么瞒得住大将军呢,00:36:19.560,00:36:21.460,How could the Great General be unaware?
00:36:22.320,00:36:23.710,哥哥再如何也好,00:36:23.540,00:36:25.200,"Out of all the things he could have done,"
00:36:24.360,00:36:26.070,怎么又和敦亲王一起,00:36:25.400,00:36:27.580,why did he choose to once again side with State Prince Dun?
00:36:27.160,00:36:29.910,就算哥哥曾经受过敦亲王的恩惠,00:36:28.200,00:36:30.640,"He may owe Prince Dun some favors,"
00:36:30.560,00:36:32.310,也不宜与他来往过密啊,00:36:31.540,00:36:33.600,but they shouldn't be in overly close contact.
00:36:32.880,00:36:35.150,如今敦亲王的女儿封了公主,00:36:34.020,00:36:36.060,"Now that Prince Dun's daughter has been
promoted to the second rank"
00:36:35.480,00:36:36.430,儿子成了贝子,,,
00:36:36.800,00:36:37.860,正是得意的时候,00:36:36.220,00:36:37.600,and his son the fourth rank.
00:36:38.240,00:36:39.830,大将军和王爷来往,00:36:37.740,00:36:39.040,His Lordship is in high favor
00:36:40.440,00:36:42.150,也是情理之中的事啊,00:36:39.320,00:36:43.020,"and it's only natural that the Great General
would see him more frequently."
00:36:42.440,00:36:46.140,敦亲王性子急 太桀骜不驯,00:36:43.400,00:36:46.720,"State Prince Dun is known for his
short temper and domineering attitude."
00:36:46.760,00:36:47.790,大将军吩咐了,,,
00:36:48.280,00:36:49.950,叫奴婢劝娘娘放心,00:36:47.840,00:36:50.880,"The Great General has ordered me to
ease Your Highness's worries."
00:36:50.680,00:36:53.430,只要大将军帮王爷得到一样东西,00:36:51.740,00:36:54.420,General Nian said he only needs to do one thing for His Lordship
00:36:53.960,00:36:55.710,到时候自然王爷,,,
00:36:56.000,00:36:58.300,也会帮娘娘重得皇上的欢心的,00:36:54.940,00:36:59.040,"and then His Lordship will help Your Highness
 regain His Majesty's favor."
00:36:59.760,00:37:00.430,果真吗,,,
00:37:00.880,00:37:02.350,有大将军和王爷在,00:37:00.740,00:37:01.740,Really?
00:37:02.680,00:37:03.900,娘娘还怕什么呀,00:37:01.900,00:37:03.420,"With the Great General and His Lordship on your side,"
,,,00:37:03.660,00:37:05.460,there's nothing for Your Highness to worry about.
00:37:06.040,00:37:07.180,但愿如此,00:37:07.040,00:37:08.340,I do hope so.
00:37:11.040,00:37:12.470,颂芝 是,00:37:12.080,00:37:13.520,"- Song Zhi.
- Yes."
00:37:12.760,00:37:14.390,快去把欢宜香给本宫点上,00:37:13.740,00:37:15.380,Light my Pleasancy for me.
00:37:15.520,00:37:17.900,本宫闻着也舒心,00:37:16.520,00:37:18.780,It puts my mind at ease.
00:37:19.200,00:37:19.870,是,00:37:20.260,00:37:21.200,Yes.
00:37:20.560,00:37:22.350,皇上驾到,00:37:21.600,00:37:23.160,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:37:22.640,00:37:24.190,皇上万福金安 起来吧,00:37:23.620,00:37:25.900,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Rise."
00:37:30.800,00:37:33.230,昨日敦亲王亲自登门,,,
00:37:33.600,00:37:34.630,去给张霖致歉,00:37:31.740,00:37:35.660,"Yesterday, State Prince Dun apologized to Zhang Lin in person."
00:37:35.400,00:37:36.750,虽然是草草了事,00:37:36.540,00:37:38.020,Although it wasn't much of an apology
00:37:37.360,00:37:39.110,事情到底也平息了不少,00:37:38.380,00:37:40.620,at least things have quieted down somewhat.
00:37:40.240,00:37:42.800,嬛嬛 你给朕帮了个大忙,00:37:41.300,00:37:43.900,"Huan Huan, you were of great help."
00:37:44.200,00:37:46.430,臣妾能为皇上分忧是应该的,00:37:45.220,00:37:47.680,It is my duty to allay Your Majesty's worries.
00:37:48.920,00:37:51.380,前朝的事臣妾不懂 也帮不上忙,00:37:49.940,00:37:52.620,I don't understand politics and can't help you in court affairs.
00:37:52.240,00:37:54.030,唯有在这些抽埋间的小事上,,,
00:37:54.400,00:37:55.230,还能说得上话,00:37:53.360,00:37:56.240,I can only chime in on small family matters.
00:38:01.240,00:38:03.190,这雪顶含翠果然是好茶,00:38:02.320,00:38:04.520,"This ""snow-drop jade"" is certainly excellent tea."
00:38:04.320,00:38:05.590,朕知道你喜欢,,,
00:38:06.520,00:38:08.590,特意给你最好的 还喜欢吗,00:38:05.480,00:38:08.460,I know you like it so I sent the best to your palace.
00:38:09.120,00:38:10.100,臣妾当然喜欢,00:38:08.880,00:38:10.080,Is it to your liking?
00:38:11.240,00:38:12.550,前儿敦亲王福晋来,00:38:10.200,00:38:11.520,Of course.
00:38:12.840,00:38:14.310,臣妾也泡了此茶款待,00:38:12.260,00:38:15.300,I offered it to State Prince Dun's wife when she visited
00:38:15.080,00:38:17.430,可福晋似乎喝惯了的样子,00:38:16.020,00:38:18.380,but it didn't seem novel to Her Ladyship.
00:38:18.360,00:38:19.870,臣妾本以为要冷场,,,
00:38:20.560,00:38:21.910,幸好福晋没有介意,00:38:19.340,00:38:22.940,"It was fortunate that Her Ladyship
didn't mind the tea and my hospitality."
00:38:23.040,00:38:26.310,朝外有所贡品 宫中有的,00:38:24.220,00:38:27.540,Whatever tribute offerings the palace receives
00:38:27.000,00:38:29.560,年大将军府必有 甚至更佳,00:38:28.160,00:38:31.040,"Great General Nian has the same, if not better."
00:38:30.600,00:38:32.900,现在连敦亲王府都有了,00:38:31.840,00:38:34.140,"Now, even State Prince Dun has the same."
00:38:33.840,00:38:35.270,朕没有赏赐过他,00:38:34.880,00:38:36.580,I never granted him that tea.
00:38:36.480,00:38:37.540,那他是哪里来的,00:38:37.480,00:38:39.240,Where could he have gotten it?
00:38:40.000,00:38:41.310,皇上不必生气,00:38:41.120,00:38:42.860,Your Majesty need not be angry.
00:38:42.360,00:38:44.630,敦亲王殴打言官已是轩然大波,00:38:43.460,00:38:45.760,"His assault of a civil official has raised ""surging waves of chaos""."
00:38:45.120,00:38:47.550,平息之后若再有什么流言出去,00:38:46.160,00:38:48.540,"If any more gossip spreads after the waves calm,"
00:38:48.200,00:38:49.830,那他劳军之功也算完了,00:38:49.080,00:38:50.980,it will tarnish his military achievements.
00:38:50.320,00:38:51.230,皇上说是不是,00:38:51.340,00:38:52.920,Does Your Majesty agree?
00:39:01.000,00:39:02.510,皇上 您喝水,00:39:02.020,00:39:04.120,"Your Majesty, I have brought you some water."
00:39:13.200,00:39:13.910,皇上,00:39:14.320,00:39:15.360,"Your Majesty,"
00:39:14.720,00:39:18.070,臣妾新绣了一个香囊想献给皇上,00:39:15.800,00:39:19.040,I've made a new sachet to present to Your Majesty.
00:39:19.000,00:39:21.190,皇上看看可还喜欢,00:39:20.020,00:39:22.400,Does Your Majesty like it?
00:39:22.440,00:39:26.430,嬛嬛前几日刚给朕绣了一个香囊,00:39:23.520,00:39:27.340,Huan Huan made me a sachet a few days ago.
00:39:27.680,00:39:29.190,朕已经佩在身上了,00:39:28.800,00:39:30.380,And I have it with me right now.
00:39:30.880,00:39:32.350,再用一个反而累赘,00:39:31.940,00:39:33.680,Having another would be unnecessary.
00:39:33.640,00:39:36.670,臣妾的绣功不及姐姐好呢,00:39:34.660,00:39:37.300,My needlework cannot compare to Sourire's.
00:39:36.880,00:39:37.510,怎会,,,
00:39:37.920,00:39:39.870,妹妹绣功精巧远在我之上,00:39:37.840,00:39:38.940,Don't be foolish!
00:39:41.120,00:39:42.590,你看皇上身上所佩戴的,00:39:38.940,00:39:41.200,Lingrong's skills are far superior to my own.
00:39:43.040,00:39:45.190,口分带 扇坠 香囊,00:39:42.080,00:39:46.100,His Majesty's belt and fan tassel
00:39:45.760,00:39:47.230,无一不是出自妹妹之手,,,
00:39:47.640,00:39:48.620,可见技艺精湛,00:39:46.860,00:39:48.280,are both made by your hand.
00:39:49.800,00:39:51.390,那是皇上不嫌弃罢了,00:39:48.700,00:39:50.120,That truly attests to your skill.
,,,00:39:50.780,00:39:53.200,"That's just because His Majesty
doesn't mind my coarse handwork."
00:39:57.200,00:39:59.580,这个也很好 朕也很喜欢,00:39:58.280,00:40:00.640,This one is also good. I like it.
00:40:00.120,00:40:02.070,拿去让芳若放在朕的寝宫,00:40:01.240,00:40:03.260,Ask Madam Orchid to put it in my sleep chamber.
00:40:03.160,00:40:04.470,臣妾笨手笨脚的,,,
00:40:04.800,00:40:06.470,皇上不嫌弃臣妾的心意,00:40:04.100,00:40:05.860,"My work is clumsy and inept,"
00:40:06.920,00:40:08.030,臣妾就很满足了,00:40:05.860,00:40:09.320,"I am glad as long as Your Majesty
appreciates the thought that went into it"
00:40:11.840,00:40:13.230,姐姐做的这个香囊,,,
00:40:13.520,00:40:14.830,很合皇上的气度呢,00:40:12.860,00:40:14.360,The sachet Sourire made
,,,00:40:14.560,00:40:16.540,suits Your Majesty's noble temperament.
00:40:16.520,00:40:19.510,倒是臣妾做的这个太小家子气了,00:40:17.560,00:40:20.540,"The one I presented, however, looks unsophisticated."
00:40:20.440,00:40:21.580,还请皇上恕罪,00:40:21.480,00:40:23.180,I hope Your Majesty will pardon me.
00:40:23.080,00:40:24.950,这哪里有什么小家子气啊,00:40:24.140,00:40:26.260,There's nothing unsophisticated about it.
00:40:26.520,00:40:27.830,朕明白你的心意,00:40:27.480,00:40:28.880,I understand the thought you put into it.
00:40:28.440,00:40:29.750,又何来怪罪之说呢,00:40:29.440,00:40:31.320,There's no need to ask for my pardon.
00:40:33.800,00:40:35.510,姐姐的绣功越发好了,00:40:34.940,00:40:36.940,"Sourire, your sewing and embroidery is getting even better."
00:40:36.560,00:40:39.630,若是绣一个鸳鸯的香囊赠与皇上,00:40:37.660,00:40:40.680,"If you make a sachet with a pair of mandarin ducks,"
00:40:40.000,00:40:41.870,表达女儿家的情意更好,00:40:41.100,00:40:43.180,it will show your tender affection towards His Majesty.
00:40:42.480,00:40:44.940,说不定皇上也更喜欢,00:40:43.540,00:40:46.000,His Majesty might like it even more.
00:40:45.600,00:40:46.550,鸳鸯固然好,00:40:46.620,00:40:48.080,That would be very thoughtful.
00:40:47.520,00:40:49.900,可皇上日夜佩戴 还出入各处,00:40:48.500,00:40:50.980,"But if His Majesty goes about wearing the sachet day and night,"
00:40:50.240,00:40:51.670,不免太儿女情长了,00:40:51.240,00:40:52.840,it will look overly sentimental.
00:40:52.720,00:40:54.630,不若以龙佩戴更显天威,00:40:53.600,00:40:56.120,"Wearing a dragon sachet instead shows
His Majesty's heavenly authority."
00:40:55.360,00:40:56.910,至于鸳鸯香囊吗,00:40:56.400,00:40:58.280,"But speaking of mandarin duck sachets,"
00:40:57.920,00:41:00.380,皇上若喜欢 臣妾就再绣一个,00:40:59.060,00:41:01.340,"I can make one for you if you like, Si Lang,"
00:41:00.920,00:41:02.230,放置四郎枕下可好,00:41:01.900,00:41:03.460,to put under your pillow.
00:41:04.000,00:41:04.790,写什么呢,,,
00:41:05.640,00:41:07.310,柳永的雨霖铃,00:41:05.140,00:41:06.340,What are you writing out?
,,,00:41:06.700,00:41:09.120,"The lyrical poem by Liu Yong
using the metre of ""Rain Sounded Bell""."
00:41:09.080,00:41:13.150,字却好 只是柳永伤感,00:41:10.060,00:41:14.120,"I like your calligraphy, but Liu Yong's poems are sorrowful."
00:41:14.240,00:41:17.550,执手相看泪眼 竟无语凝噎,00:41:15.300,00:41:19.380,"“Hands held, gazing into each other's teary eyes,
Our sobbing breath chokes the words to be said.”"
00:41:18.440,00:41:20.030,太不合此情此景,00:41:19.580,00:41:21.280,That poem does not match the present moment.
00:41:42.840,00:41:44.910,花好月圆人长久,,,
00:41:45.680,00:41:49.070,拿去 挂在你寝宫床头最合适,00:41:42.760,00:41:47.920,"“This night brings a full moon and blooming flowers.
May My beloved and I long abide in this peaceful life.”"
00:41:49.320,00:41:50.070,谢皇上,00:41:48.040,00:41:50.060,"Here, take this and put it above your bed."
00:41:51.560,00:41:53.510,皇上与姐姐如此恩爱,00:41:50.300,00:41:51.720,I thank Your Majesty.
00:41:54.080,00:41:55.270,当真是一段佳话,00:41:52.680,00:41:54.820,Your Majesty is so affectionate towards Sourire.
00:41:55.640,00:41:57.070,姐姐有这样好的福气,00:41:55.040,00:41:56.580,This is a romantic story for the ages.
00:41:57.520,00:41:59.150,旁人是求也求不来的,00:41:56.760,00:42:00.140,"No one could ever enjoy such fortune as you, Sourire."
00:41:59.960,00:42:01.470,皇上快去劝和劝和,,,
00:42:01.960,00:42:03.020,安妹妹吃醋了,00:42:01.000,00:42:02.620,Your Majesty needs to make peace with Lingrong.
00:42:04.320,00:42:05.460,姐姐又取笑我,00:42:02.960,00:42:04.780,"She's being silly and ""sour as vinegar""."
00:42:06.200,00:42:07.230,臣妾怎么敢,00:42:05.300,00:42:06.860,"You always tease me, Sourire."
00:42:07.560,00:42:09.030,对皇上和姐姐有醋意呢,00:42:07.280,00:42:09.980,How would I dare to be sour about you and His Majesty?
00:42:09.400,00:42:10.710,容儿性子最谦和,00:42:10.220,00:42:11.680,Lingong is the mildest of all of you.
00:42:11.440,00:42:12.470,就算是吃醋,00:42:12.460,00:42:14.000,"If she's as sour as vinegar,"
00:42:13.080,00:42:15.150,也只吃那刚酿了一个月的醋,00:42:14.000,00:42:16.220,it's vinegar that has only been fermenting for a month
00:42:15.600,00:42:16.150,不会酸,00:42:16.460,00:42:17.740,which is barely sour at all.
