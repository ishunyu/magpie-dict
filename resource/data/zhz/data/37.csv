00:02:23.200,00:02:24.110,闻闻香吗,00:02:24.300,00:02:25.440,Does it smell good?
00:02:26.960,00:02:27.750,曹姐姐,00:02:28.040,00:02:29.140,Lady Cao.
00:02:31.200,00:02:32.510,莞嫔娘娘金安,00:02:32.080,00:02:33.460,Peace to Your Highness.
00:02:32.760,00:02:33.510,姐姐快起来,00:02:33.660,00:02:34.660,"Please rise, Cao."
00:02:38.600,00:02:39.870,姐姐真是好兴致,00:02:39.620,00:02:41.240,You seem to be in good spirits.
00:02:41.160,00:02:42.790,温宜天天嚷着要出来玩,00:02:42.040,00:02:43.960,Wenyi whines every day until I bring her out to play.
00:02:43.200,00:02:45.790,这个鬼灵精 当真是闹得我头疼,00:02:44.180,00:02:46.940,This mischievous little goblin gives me a headache.
00:02:46.160,00:02:48.150,让姐姐这样日日头痛的福气,00:02:47.260,00:02:49.080,"Even if they wished for it,"
00:02:48.480,00:02:49.620,别人要求还求不来呢,00:02:49.080,00:02:51.180,others couldn't have such a headache.
00:02:50.680,00:02:52.030,莞娘娘抱一个好不好,00:02:51.560,00:02:53.280,Can I hold you for a second?
00:02:52.240,00:02:54.950,哎呀 温宜公主 哎呀,00:02:53.320,00:02:56.380,"Aiya, princess Wenyi, aiya."
00:02:56.440,00:02:57.710,不许对莞娘娘无礼,,,
00:02:58.080,00:02:58.790,快叫莞娘娘,00:02:57.480,00:02:58.840,Behave yourself with Concubine Sourire.
00:02:59.000,00:02:59.310,莞娘娘,00:02:58.980,00:02:59.940,Greet Concubine Sourire.
00:02:59.560,00:03:01.350,没事 小孩子不怕生才有趣呢,00:02:59.940,00:03:00.900,Concubine Sourire.
,,,00:03:00.900,00:03:03.020,"No worries. It's sweet when
a child isn't shy with strangers."
00:03:02.320,00:03:03.230,亲一个莞娘娘,00:03:03.280,00:03:04.620,Give me a kiss.
00:03:05.240,00:03:05.910,这边,00:03:06.240,00:03:07.400,And this side.
00:03:07.800,00:03:10.070,好了 仔细把您的衣服弄皱了,00:03:08.720,00:03:11.540,"Here, be careful not to crease Your Highness's dress."
00:03:16.240,00:03:17.550,嫔妾有话要说,00:03:17.100,00:03:18.780,I have something to tell Your Highness.
00:03:20.800,00:03:21.830,春光甚好,00:03:21.660,00:03:22.940,It's so beautiful outside in spring.
00:03:22.120,00:03:23.830,本宫正要去迎春圃逛逛,00:03:22.960,00:03:25.060,"I was just going to take a stroll
in the Garden of Dawning Spring."
00:03:24.280,00:03:25.230,先行一步了,00:03:25.260,00:03:26.500,Please excuse me.
00:03:26.160,00:03:27.300,恭送莞嫔娘娘,00:03:27.080,00:03:28.600,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:03:42.160,00:03:42.910,曹姐姐,00:03:42.980,00:03:43.880,Cao.
00:03:45.000,00:03:46.270,有话要对本宫说吗,00:03:45.980,00:03:47.640,You have something to tell me ?
00:03:55.320,00:03:56.230,华妃重定,00:03:56.440,00:03:57.720,"Having regained her status,"
00:03:56.560,00:03:58.710,昨日曾召了嫔妾去翊坤宫,00:03:57.720,00:03:59.920,"Consort Fleur summoned me to
the Palace of Earthly Honor yesterday."
00:04:00.000,00:04:00.870,这很好啊,00:04:01.060,00:04:02.540,There is nothing wrong with that.
00:04:01.960,00:04:04.340,曹姐姐与华妃一向有来往,00:04:02.860,00:04:05.300,You have always been close with her.
00:04:04.840,00:04:05.750,如今她重定,,,
00:04:06.120,00:04:07.230,你也应该去贺一贺,00:04:05.840,00:04:08.420,"Now that her title has been restored,
you should congratulate her."
00:04:08.080,00:04:10.540,是 贺礼早已送去了,00:04:09.080,00:04:09.940,Certainly.
,,,00:04:10.100,00:04:11.920,Congratulatory gifts have already been sent.
00:04:11.360,00:04:13.950,只是华妃此次召嫔妾前去,00:04:12.320,00:04:15.080,"However, Consort Fleur asked about"
00:04:14.440,00:04:15.710,问了在她幽闭期间,,,
00:04:16.160,00:04:17.470,娘娘您的言行举动,00:04:15.540,00:04:18.840,"Your Highness's activities over the
period of her confinement."
00:04:19.560,00:04:20.870,姐姐这样聪明的人,,,
00:04:21.360,00:04:22.710,自然是应对得宜的,00:04:20.620,00:04:22.240,An intelligent woman such as yourself
00:04:24.080,00:04:24.830,无论怎样,00:04:22.360,00:04:24.300,can surely respond to her questions with propriety.
00:04:25.640,00:04:27.150,都在于姐姐您的打算,00:04:25.100,00:04:26.340,Whatever you say
,,,00:04:26.560,00:04:28.640,"depends on your plans for the future, Lady Cao."
00:04:28.000,00:04:29.510,嫔妾能有什么打算呢,00:04:28.980,00:04:30.660,What plans would I have?
00:04:30.000,00:04:32.430,一切不过是看娘娘罢了,00:04:30.920,00:04:33.360,I am just following Your Highnees's lead.
00:04:35.560,00:04:37.190,怎么说 华妃娘娘,,,
00:04:37.560,00:04:38.470,都是姐姐的旧主,00:04:36.620,00:04:39.520,"Still, Consort Fleur was your old master."
00:04:39.120,00:04:40.390,虽然待公主和姐姐,,,
00:04:40.720,00:04:42.030,有些地方是刻薄了些,00:04:40.060,00:04:43.380,"Although she was unkind to you and the princess at times,"
00:04:42.920,00:04:45.070,但好歹也曾提携过姐姐,00:04:43.760,00:04:46.280,she aided in promoting your status after all.
00:04:45.960,00:04:48.470,位分家世又远在本宫之上,00:04:46.940,00:04:49.880,"Her rank and family background
are far superior to my own."
00:04:49.800,00:04:51.550,姐姐要与华妃娘娘亲近,,,
00:04:52.040,00:04:53.430,也是情理之中的事,00:04:50.880,00:04:54.320,It's only natural if you plan to be close to her.
00:04:54.320,00:04:56.780,娘娘又何必和嫔妾打哑谜呢,00:04:55.320,00:04:57.960,Your Highness need not speak in riddles.
00:04:58.000,00:05:00.350,嫔妾虽不伶俐却也知道,00:04:58.940,00:05:01.320,"Dull-witted as I am, I do know that"
00:05:00.680,00:05:02.230,华妃此次的重定和得宠,00:05:01.640,00:05:03.580,Consort Fleur's regained favor and status
00:05:02.680,00:05:03.900,不过是昙花一现,00:05:03.580,00:05:05.600,will pass like the blooming of an orchid cactus.
00:05:04.720,00:05:07.590,再如何也只是强弩之末罢了,00:05:05.800,00:05:08.680,She's an arrow approaching the end of its flight.
00:05:08.880,00:05:10.910,嫔妾与公主想要安身立命,,,
00:05:11.360,00:05:12.830,自然不会再冒险,00:05:09.840,00:05:14.060,"I want a peaceful life for Wenyi and myself,
so I won't be taking any risks."
00:05:16.560,00:05:18.790,曹姐姐察言观色 心思敏捷,00:05:17.520,00:05:20.200,"Cao, you have a perceptive mind and a keen intellect"
00:05:19.840,00:05:21.670,不是寻常人可以比的,00:05:20.780,00:05:23.000,to which few people can compare.
00:05:23.640,00:05:25.940,其实本宫也不希望,00:05:24.620,00:05:27.160,"In fact, I do not wish that"
00:05:26.240,00:05:27.870,姐姐与华妃娘娘生疏,00:05:27.240,00:05:29.160,you drift apart from Consort Fleur.
00:05:31.000,00:05:32.710,嫔妾既将自身与公主,,,
00:05:33.080,00:05:33.950,托付给了娘娘,00:05:32.040,00:05:35.120,"Since I have entrusted the princess
and myself to Your Highness,"
00:05:34.400,00:05:36.350,自然是唯娘娘之命是从,00:05:35.400,00:05:37.700,I will follow only Your Highness's orders.
00:05:37.000,00:05:38.670,如何再会倾向于她呢,00:05:38.040,00:05:40.120,Why would I lean towards her?
00:05:40.160,00:05:43.110,娘娘的吩咐 嫔妾自然明白,00:05:41.080,00:05:44.040,I understand Your Highness's request.
00:05:43.600,00:05:44.990,不会叫娘娘失望的,00:05:44.560,00:05:46.300,And I will not disappoint Your Highness.
00:05:46.000,00:05:47.220,曹姐姐进退有度,,,
00:05:47.840,00:05:49.590,本宫自然没有什么不放心的,00:05:46.940,00:05:49.000,"Cao, you understand when to advance and when to withdraw."
00:05:51.280,00:05:52.990,华妃娘娘既然愿意打听,00:05:49.220,00:05:50.480,I have nothing to worry about.
00:05:53.360,00:05:54.310,本宫的动静,00:05:52.300,00:05:55.200,"Since Consort Fleur has inquired about me,"
00:05:54.680,00:05:57.830,那本宫只好以彼之道还施彼身了,00:05:55.660,00:05:58.960,I will use her same methods against her.
00:05:59.520,00:06:00.660,对于此次重定,,,
00:06:01.200,00:06:02.420,她自己有何想法,00:06:00.440,00:06:03.660,What are her thoughts about her reinstatement?
00:06:04.720,00:06:06.030,华妃沉醉其中,00:06:05.760,00:06:07.700,She's been reveling in the feeling of it
00:06:06.640,00:06:08.990,却也时常害怕会再度失宠,00:06:07.700,00:06:10.060,but is also afraid of losing favor again.
00:06:10.200,00:06:11.470,因为先前失宠,,,
00:06:11.960,00:06:12.510,加之听闻了,00:06:11.200,00:06:12.860,"With her previous fall from favor,"
00:06:12.800,00:06:14.670,齐妃和富察贵人的变故,00:06:12.900,00:06:15.620,"and having heard about what happened to
Consort Astuce and Noble Lady Fuca,"
00:06:15.320,00:06:17.700,对娘娘您倒颇为忌惮,00:06:16.360,00:06:18.620,she is quite wary of Your Highness.
00:06:20.640,00:06:22.470,她早就视本宫为死敌,00:06:21.540,00:06:23.800,She's seen me as her arch-enemy for all this time.
00:06:23.440,00:06:25.590,当然本宫也是如此,00:06:24.460,00:06:26.700,"Of course, I view her the same way."
00:06:27.360,00:06:29.190,娘娘自然有办法应付她,00:06:28.240,00:06:30.680,Your Highness will certainly have ways to deal with her.
00:06:29.960,00:06:32.550,嫔妾不过是略尽绵薄之力罢了,00:06:30.920,00:06:33.520,I will do what little I can.
00:06:34.160,00:06:35.220,只是有一事,,,
00:06:36.320,00:06:37.870,嫔妾与娘娘相处,00:06:35.080,00:06:37.020,"There is one more thing, however."
00:06:38.320,00:06:40.030,并无直接的利害关系,00:06:37.360,00:06:41.040,Your Highness and I have no vital interests in common.
00:06:40.880,00:06:43.790,说得难听些 不过是因利而合,00:06:41.760,00:06:44.940,"To be vulgar, it's an alliance based on short term interests."
00:06:44.760,00:06:47.550,他朝利尽 也可一拍两散,00:06:45.780,00:06:49.020,"When our interests no longer align,
we may go our separate ways."
00:06:49.400,00:06:50.670,嫔妾自知低微,,,
00:06:51.040,00:06:52.390,不可与娘娘相抗衡,00:06:50.300,00:06:53.600,"Given my humble status, I understand that
I can never contend with Your Highness."
00:06:53.560,00:06:58.470,因此只怕不能很好地协助娘娘,00:06:54.500,00:06:55.800,"Therefore,"
00:07:00.720,00:07:01.780,曹姐姐爽快,00:06:57.360,00:07:00.200,I am afraid I may not be of much help to Your Highness.
00:07:02.520,00:07:04.190,你的顾虑亦是我的顾虑,00:07:01.820,00:07:03.480,"Cao, you are refreshingly candid."
,,,00:07:03.480,00:07:05.540,Your concern is the same as my own.
00:07:05.360,00:07:07.350,本宫至今膝下无有所出,00:07:06.260,00:07:08.540,"As of yet, I still do not have any children."
00:07:08.200,00:07:09.950,温宜公主玉雪可爱,00:07:09.220,00:07:11.300,Princess Wenyi is as fair as jade and snow.
00:07:10.920,00:07:12.310,本宫有意在事成之后,,,
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.390,收她为义女,00:07:11.880,00:07:14.640,"I would like her to become my
honorary daughter after we succeed"
00:07:13.960,00:07:15.630,这样 彼此也好有个依靠,00:07:14.860,00:07:16.940,so we can be each other's support.
00:07:16.360,00:07:17.390,姐姐意下如何,00:07:17.320,00:07:18.900,"What do you think, Cao?"
00:07:19.600,00:07:22.230,若如此 彼此倒也安心了,00:07:20.580,00:07:23.380,"If that were to happen, then we all would be at ease."
00:07:23.320,00:07:24.590,娘娘前途无量,,,
00:07:25.000,00:07:26.390,能有这样的义母照拂,00:07:24.320,00:07:25.960,Your Highness's prospects are boundless.
00:07:26.760,00:07:28.270,自然是温宜的福气了,00:07:25.960,00:07:29.160,"It would be Wenyi's blessing
to receive Your Highness's care."
00:07:31.160,00:07:32.630,姐姐此物很眼熟,00:07:32.200,00:07:34.080,"Cao, your hairpin looks familiar."
00:07:33.800,00:07:36.070,似乎在皇上的库房里见过一次,00:07:34.560,00:07:37.160,I saw it in His Majesty's treasury once.
00:07:36.800,00:07:37.940,定是皇上赏的吧,00:07:37.540,00:07:39.400,It must have been granted to you by His Majesty.
00:07:38.320,00:07:41.270,是一点小玩意儿罢了,00:07:39.400,00:07:41.880,"Indeed, but it was just a small gift."
00:07:44.600,00:07:46.270,姐姐手长得真漂亮,00:07:45.640,00:07:47.600,"Cao, you have really beautiful hands."
00:07:47.640,00:07:49.270,若只是以茉莉花染指,00:07:48.640,00:07:50.520,Your nails look delicate
00:07:49.880,00:07:51.070,不过是小巧而已,00:07:50.740,00:07:52.640,with just some jasmine oil on them.
00:07:52.920,00:07:54.950,若能把迎春镶嵌在指甲上,00:07:53.980,00:07:56.640,"But if you painted them with winter jasmine petals,"
00:07:55.800,00:07:58.950,别出心裁 必定更讨皇上欢心,00:07:56.760,00:08:00.140,this unique touch would surely please His Majesty.
00:08:00.640,00:08:02.190,多谢娘娘指点,00:08:01.660,00:08:03.720,I thank Your Highness for the advice.
00:08:05.040,00:08:06.590,温大人今日走得匆忙,00:08:05.680,00:08:07.800,"Dr. Wen, you are leaving in such a rush today."
00:08:06.920,00:08:07.980,连茶都没喝呢,,,
00:08:09.560,00:08:11.070,有劳小主挪动玉步了,00:08:07.800,00:08:09.500,You did not even have any tea.
00:08:11.520,00:08:13.510,只是莞嫔娘娘的药还在喂着,00:08:10.480,00:08:12.480,"My Lady, please don't trouble yourself to walk me out."
00:08:13.960,00:08:15.870,怕那些小太监们不好好看着,00:08:12.480,00:08:14.700,Concubine Sourire's herbs are still on the stove.
00:08:16.160,00:08:17.270,过了时辰失了药性,00:08:15.000,00:08:18.160,"I am worried that if the servants lose track of time,
the herbs will lose their effect."
00:08:18.360,00:08:19.420,莞嫔病了吗,,,
00:08:19.880,00:08:20.630,那倒不是,00:08:19.340,00:08:20.780,Is Concubine Sourire ill?
,,,00:08:20.900,00:08:21.780,"No,"
00:08:20.920,00:08:23.220,是莞嫔娘娘敷脸的神仙玉女粉,00:08:22.020,00:08:24.820,"they are preparing the Immortal Jade Maiden Powder
for Her Highness's complexion."
00:08:24.080,00:08:25.910,那些小太监们粗手笨脚的,00:08:25.080,00:08:27.020,Those young servants are heavy handed
00:08:26.240,00:08:27.670,免不得微臣要去盯着,00:08:27.020,00:08:28.980,so I have to watch over it myself.
00:08:28.560,00:08:29.590,我道是什么呢,00:08:29.460,00:08:31.140,I thought it was something urgent.
00:08:30.400,00:08:33.110,只是这时候莞嫔颇得圣意,00:08:31.300,00:08:34.340,His Majesty is very fond of Concubine Sourire right now.
00:08:33.800,00:08:36.310,有雨露之恩 自然不必费心,,,
00:08:36.600,00:08:38.070,用什么神仙玉女粉了,00:08:34.720,00:08:38.580,"Given His Majesty's grace, she doesn't need such luxurious face powder."
00:08:38.880,00:08:41.590,何况莞嫔如今炙手可热,00:08:39.900,00:08:42.780,Concubine Sourire is at the height of her favor.
00:08:42.280,00:08:44.350,宫里的门槛都要被踩破,00:08:43.360,00:08:45.700,Her doorstep must be weathered from all the visitors.
00:08:45.560,00:08:46.910,我这个做姐姐的,,,
00:08:47.240,00:08:48.630,尚且要避一避嫌,00:08:46.340,00:08:49.680,"I have to keep my distance, even as her sister."
00:08:49.520,00:08:52.910,大人倒是要去急着锦上添花了,00:08:50.520,00:08:53.980,"But sir, you are bustling around to
""sew an extra flower onto her beautiful brocade."""
00:08:53.680,00:08:55.910,小主 您何出此言呢,00:08:54.460,00:08:57.320,"My Lady, what makes you say that?"
00:09:00.080,00:09:02.990,我近来脾气不好 冲撞大人了,00:09:00.720,00:09:04.020,"I've been in a foul mood lately.
Please pardon my offense."
00:09:04.200,00:09:06.990,只不过我也是白说一句罢了,00:09:05.040,00:09:08.220,But I know my words are to no avail.
00:09:08.120,00:09:09.910,锦上添花无人记,00:09:08.960,00:09:11.000,"No one remembers the extra flower sewed on a brocade,"
00:09:10.440,00:09:13.470,雪中送炭情意深哪,00:09:11.400,00:09:14.380,but charcoal sent on a snowy day touches one's heart deeply.
00:09:14.680,00:09:18.750,大人 这个道理你应当明白吧,00:09:15.440,00:09:20.100,"Dr. Wen, I believe you understand this well."
00:09:20.640,00:09:22.870,这研制医药本是微臣的本分,00:09:21.560,00:09:23.940,Preparing medicinal herbs is my duty.
00:09:23.480,00:09:25.470,正如微臣也潜心地为小主,,,
00:09:25.800,00:09:26.750,请脉取药一般,00:09:24.380,00:09:28.020,"And that's why I also devote myself to your
herb supplies and routine pulse-taking."
00:09:28.120,00:09:29.910,微臣并不介意锦上添花,00:09:29.140,00:09:31.000,"I don't mind ""adding a flower to the brocade."""
00:09:30.200,00:09:31.030,只是真心地希望,00:09:31.080,00:09:32.360,"But I sincerely hope,"
00:09:31.400,00:09:33.630,无论小主也好 莞嫔娘娘也好,00:09:32.360,00:09:34.660,"whether it is you or Concubine Sourire,"
00:09:34.120,00:09:36.910,永无轮到微臣雪中送炭的一日,00:09:34.980,00:09:38.180,"that there will never be ""a snowy day""
when my skills must be ""your charcoal."""
00:09:38.440,00:09:40.430,但愿温大人待我和莞妹妹,,,
00:09:40.800,00:09:43.030,一视同仁 多加照拂,00:09:39.320,00:09:43.900,"Dr. Wen, I hope that you will see
Sourire and me as equals"
00:09:43.680,00:09:45.590,不要分了彼此才好,00:09:44.640,00:09:46.780,and care for us equally well.
00:09:46.480,00:09:48.110,莞嫔小主和小主,,,
00:09:48.440,00:09:50.350,皆是微臣需要照拂玉体之人,00:09:47.460,00:09:51.540,"My Lady, I will attend to the good health
of you and Concubine Sourire."
00:09:51.240,00:09:53.270,微臣心中别无他念,00:09:52.260,00:09:54.920,Nothing other than this is on my mind.
00:09:56.640,00:09:59.070,采月 去送一送大人,00:09:57.400,00:09:59.880,"Lunar, walk Dr. Wen out."
00:09:59.440,00:10:00.150,是,,,
00:10:00.960,00:10:01.830,大人慢走,00:10:00.380,00:10:01.500,"Yes, My Lady."
,,,00:10:01.880,00:10:03.240,"Take care, Dr. Wen."
00:10:09.920,00:10:10.710,小主,00:10:11.040,00:10:12.300,My Lady ...
00:10:14.480,00:10:17.310,姐姐 你怎么站在风口上,00:10:15.500,00:10:18.600,"Meizhuang, why are you standing outside in the cold?"
00:10:18.240,00:10:19.710,等下受了风就不好了,00:10:18.940,00:10:21.360,You should be careful not to get a cold.
00:10:21.160,00:10:23.390,妹妹今日怎么贵步临贱地,00:10:22.200,00:10:24.800,What brings Your Highness to my humble residence today?
00:10:24.000,00:10:26.630,不用陪着皇上去讨华妃的好吗,00:10:24.940,00:10:27.780,"Don't you need to spend time with His Majesty
to seek favor for Consort Fleur?"
00:10:28.760,00:10:29.950,姐姐先别生气,00:10:29.700,00:10:31.260,Please don't be angry.
00:10:32.120,00:10:33.750,我今日来正是为了此事,00:10:33.120,00:10:35.140,That's why I come here today.
00:10:34.600,00:10:35.740,请姐姐听我一言,00:10:35.600,00:10:37.300,Please allow me to explain.
00:10:36.480,00:10:38.390,我累了 要进去睡会儿,00:10:37.500,00:10:39.280,I'm tired. I want to rest.
00:10:39.040,00:10:42.150,醒来还要去太后宫中 你请回吧,00:10:40.020,00:10:41.900,And I need to visit Her Majesty after that.
00:10:42.560,00:10:43.590,姐姐纵然生气,00:10:42.320,00:10:43.140,Please leave.
00:10:45.280,00:10:46.340,也听我说两句吧,00:10:43.540,00:10:45.300,"I know you are angry with me,"
00:10:47.680,00:10:50.110,难道姐姐都不顾昔日的,00:10:46.060,00:10:48.020,but at least allow me a chance to speak.
00:10:50.400,00:10:51.350,姐妹情分了吗,00:10:48.720,00:10:52.760,"Have you lost faith in the years
we spent together as sisters?"
00:10:57.640,00:10:58.350,进来吧,00:10:58.640,00:10:59.760,Come in.
00:11:10.880,00:11:13.230,姐姐宫里怎么连个人影都没有,00:11:11.720,00:11:14.160,Why is there no one about in your palace?
00:11:14.680,00:11:17.060,那些奴才呢 怎么不伺候着,00:11:15.580,00:11:18.160,Where are the servants? Why aren't they with you?
00:11:18.960,00:11:21.230,今儿是宫中发放夏衣的日子,00:11:20.080,00:11:22.760,"The Household Department
is distributing summer clothing today."
00:11:21.680,00:11:23.390,我让他们去内务府领了,00:11:22.760,00:11:24.520,I sent the servants there to collect it.
00:11:24.560,00:11:26.860,比不得你宫里家大业大,00:11:25.440,00:11:27.940,It's nothing like your opulent palace
00:11:27.360,00:11:28.710,人人都上赶着去,00:11:28.200,00:11:30.060,with crowds rushing forward to serve it.
00:11:29.520,00:11:31.270,连内务府主事的姜公公,00:11:30.480,00:11:32.480,"The head of the Household Department, Mr. Jiang"
00:11:31.600,00:11:33.670,都亲自上门送奴才们的衣裳,00:11:32.480,00:11:35.040,even personally delivers the clothes for your servants.
00:11:35.200,00:11:35.950,我知道,00:11:36.200,00:11:37.460,I know
00:11:36.960,00:11:39.190,姐姐不是在意皇上的宠幸,00:11:38.060,00:11:40.720,that you don't care about His Majesty's favor.
00:11:42.320,00:11:43.430,姐姐这样说,00:11:43.320,00:11:45.080,Did you say that
00:11:45.120,00:11:46.710,可是为了华妃重定一事,00:11:46.040,00:11:48.440,because of Consort Fleur's reinstatement?
00:11:52.040,00:11:53.950,好 那我问你,00:11:52.920,00:11:55.040,"All right, then tell me"
00:11:54.480,00:11:55.700,华妃重定之事,,,
00:11:56.000,00:11:57.470,是不是你向皇上提议,00:11:55.620,00:11:58.800,"was it you who suggested to
His Majesty to reinstate Consort Fleur?"
00:11:58.240,00:11:58.830,是,00:11:59.200,00:12:00.260,Yes.
00:12:00.000,00:12:02.560,可是姐姐 我也是不得已,00:12:00.800,00:12:03.660,"But Meizhuang, I was without a choice."
00:12:03.560,00:12:05.030,谁愿意捧了杀了自己孩子的,,,
00:12:05.400,00:12:06.150,仇敌上位,00:12:04.540,00:12:07.420,Who wants to aid the enemy that has killed one's child?
00:12:07.120,00:12:08.550,也请姐姐为我想一想,,,
00:12:09.480,00:12:10.830,若不是情非得已,00:12:08.000,00:12:10.180,Think about it from my perspective -
00:12:11.480,00:12:12.540,我何必走这一招,00:12:10.620,00:12:12.360,"if it wasn't my only option,"
00:12:13.880,00:12:15.150,姐姐不能容忍的,00:12:12.360,00:12:13.940,why would I resort to this?
,,,00:12:14.820,00:12:16.700,"Meizhuang, I know you can't bear it,"
00:12:15.680,00:12:18.140,妹妹我身受之苦并不亚于姐姐,00:12:16.700,00:12:19.200,but I have endured no less suffering than you.
00:12:19.120,00:12:20.230,难道可以容忍吗,00:12:20.100,00:12:22.000,Do you think I bear this easily?
00:12:21.520,00:12:22.950,那你是为了什么,00:12:22.500,00:12:24.400,Then tell me your reasons.
00:12:26.160,00:12:31.230,姐姐三思 为了安抚年羹尧,00:12:27.140,00:12:28.760,Think about it this way -
,,,00:12:30.900,00:12:32.780,"in order to appease Nian Gengyao,"
00:12:32.520,00:12:34.900,皇上迟早会复年世兰的分位,00:12:33.480,00:12:36.040,"His Majesty will reinstate Nian Shilan sooner or later,"
00:12:35.800,00:12:37.230,最低便是华妃一位,00:12:36.840,00:12:38.700,"at least her honorary name,"
00:12:38.840,00:12:40.030,若情势所迫,,,
00:12:41.320,00:12:43.550,只怕封个贵妃也不是不可能的,00:12:39.920,00:12:44.440,"if not promoting her to Noble Consort, depending on the situation in court."
00:12:45.200,00:12:47.110,纵使姐姐今日得太后欢心,00:12:46.140,00:12:48.360,"Even if the Empress Dowager favors you,"
00:12:47.680,00:12:49.150,来日还是无力阻挡,00:12:48.500,00:12:50.640,you can't hold your ground against Consort Nian.
00:12:50.320,00:12:52.830,与其这样 宁可由我来说,00:12:51.060,00:12:52.460,"Instead of watching that situation unfold,"
00:12:54.280,00:12:56.110,宁可皇上因为我而给她加封时,00:12:52.740,00:12:54.020,I chose to be the person who suggested it
00:12:56.520,00:12:57.790,有更多的无奈和愧疚,00:12:55.220,00:12:59.060,"because His Majesty knows he has no choice, and
now will also feel guilty when he reinstates her."
00:12:59.000,00:13:00.190,这样的情绪越多,,,
00:13:00.760,00:13:01.900,我的地位就越稳,00:12:59.900,00:13:01.580,"As such feelings grow,"
00:13:03.400,00:13:05.230,纵使你说得这样清楚,00:13:01.700,00:13:03.600,my position will be more stable.
00:13:05.920,00:13:07.270,可是我还是不明白,00:13:04.260,00:13:06.560,You've explained it very clearly
00:13:08.080,00:13:10.790,她今儿是华妃 明儿成了贵妃,00:13:06.800,00:13:08.840,but why am I still so confused?
00:13:11.120,00:13:12.070,岂非更加简单,00:13:09.080,00:13:13.300,"With her title of Consort restored, won't it be even
easier for her to become a Noble Consort?"
00:13:12.960,00:13:15.420,纵使你步步算计 可是她未必,00:13:13.620,00:13:15.740,"You may have calculated your moves,"
00:13:15.760,00:13:17.270,步步走入你算计之中啊,00:13:15.880,00:13:18.500,but she won't necessarily act as you expect.
00:13:20.080,00:13:24.790,是 不知从什么时候开始,00:13:21.060,00:13:22.220,You're right.
,,,00:13:24.360,00:13:26.140,I don't know when it was
00:13:25.880,00:13:29.110,我已变得攻于算计 自私凉薄,00:13:26.720,00:13:30.480,that I became this calculating and selfish.
00:13:30.400,00:13:31.190,我知道,00:13:31.380,00:13:32.400,I know
00:13:33.040,00:13:34.870,我已不是善良单纯的人了,00:13:33.960,00:13:36.400,I’m no longer the kind and innocent person I was.
00:13:35.960,00:13:39.710,可是我这么做 的确是有,00:13:36.900,00:13:38.300,But I did so
00:13:40.080,00:13:41.270,不好马上说出口的道理,00:13:39.940,00:13:42.340,for reasons that are not easy to explain right now.
00:13:41.520,00:13:44.150,好了好了 你总有你的理由,00:13:42.380,00:13:43.760,"All right, all right."
00:13:44.520,00:13:45.830,我也有我的不明白,00:13:43.760,00:13:46.940,You can have your reasons and I have my confusion.
00:13:46.920,00:13:48.710,话不投机半句多,00:13:47.700,00:13:50.200,"""Half a sentence is too much conversation if poorly timed."""
00:13:53.360,00:13:56.110,莫不是你见年羹尧势强,00:13:54.180,00:13:57.420,Is it because you want to use Consort Fleur to curry favor with Nian Genyao
00:13:56.800,00:13:58.590,要以华妃去讨好他们,00:13:57.680,00:14:00.180,because you've seen Nian Gengyao’s power grow?
00:14:02.200,00:14:04.950,姐姐嬛儿在你眼里,00:14:03.160,00:14:04.420,"Meizhuang,"
00:14:05.280,00:14:06.310,就这般不堪吗,00:14:05.440,00:14:07.400,am I so despicable in your eyes?
00:14:08.560,00:14:09.870,她并没有忘了,00:14:09.280,00:14:11.000,I have never forgotten
00:14:10.840,00:14:13.070,她当日是怎么失去腹中孩子的,00:14:11.620,00:14:14.120,how I lost my child that day.
00:14:15.400,00:14:19.270,嬛儿 我们自小就在一处,00:14:16.280,00:14:17.020,"Huan’er,"
,,,00:14:18.440,00:14:20.440,we grew up together.
00:14:20.400,00:14:24.230,我知道自己才不如你 貌也逊色,00:14:21.340,00:14:25.440,"I've always known that my looks and wits
fade in comparison to you."
00:14:25.320,00:14:28.190,便立意修德博一个温婉贤良,00:14:26.240,00:14:29.320,So I decided to cultivate my virtue and modesty.
00:14:29.240,00:14:32.110,你擅舞艺 我便着意琴技,00:14:30.280,00:14:33.160,"You were good at dancing, so I focused on the zither."
00:14:32.960,00:14:34.710,从来也不逊色于你,00:14:33.940,00:14:36.040,My skills were never inferior to yours.
00:14:36.000,00:14:38.150,后来我们一起入了宫,00:14:36.920,00:14:39.820,"Then, we were selected to enter the palace together."
00:14:39.040,00:14:41.420,你和我总是相互扶持,00:14:40.100,00:14:42.620,We always supported each other.
00:14:42.760,00:14:45.430,即便皇上已经不宠爱我了,00:14:43.460,00:14:46.580,"Even though His Majesty no longer favors me,"
00:14:47.440,00:14:49.310,我也不曾忌恨你半分,00:14:48.420,00:14:50.860,I never resented you in the least.
00:14:51.360,00:14:52.870,可是不知道为什么,00:14:52.220,00:14:54.460,"But I don’t know why,"
00:14:54.360,00:14:55.990,如今我看着你,00:14:55.340,00:14:56.980,"looking at you now,"
00:14:57.040,00:14:59.110,总觉得和你差得好多,00:14:58.040,00:15:00.340,I feel that I’m so far behind.
00:15:01.000,00:15:02.550,你有温太医的爱慕,00:15:02.040,00:15:03.980,You have Dr. Wen’s admiration
00:15:03.680,00:15:05.270,又有皇上的宠爱,00:15:04.720,00:15:06.440,and His Majesty’s favor.
00:15:06.800,00:15:09.790,你的父亲也在皇上跟前得脸,00:15:07.800,00:15:10.880,Your father has received honors from His Majesty.
00:15:11.120,00:15:13.030,你样样皆是得意的了,00:15:11.980,00:15:14.260,Everything is going well for you.
00:15:14.720,00:15:20.980,可是我 却是什么都没有的,00:15:16.020,00:15:17.360,But I ...
,,,00:15:19.540,00:15:21.840,I have nothing.
00:15:22.920,00:15:26.070,记得小的时候和姐姐一起,00:15:23.760,00:15:25.760,"I remember when we were little,"
00:15:26.400,00:15:27.790,把折好的纸船放下水,00:15:26.440,00:15:29.460,we set off paper boats into the river together.
00:15:29.560,00:15:33.630,嬷嬷说了 这船漂得远便嫁得远,00:15:30.580,00:15:32.200,The nursemaid said
,,,00:15:32.260,00:15:34.360,"the further the boats traveled,"
00:15:34.320,00:15:35.950,漂得近便嫁得近,00:15:34.960,00:15:37.400,the further from home we would marry.
00:15:37.280,00:15:40.590,可姐姐说 咱们俩的船,00:15:38.260,00:15:39.780,But you said
00:15:41.280,00:15:42.500,要放得一样远,00:15:40.600,00:15:43.620,both our boats had to travel the same distance
00:15:43.240,00:15:46.750,以后便嫁去一处 最好是两兄弟,00:15:44.020,00:15:45.980,So we would marry in the same place -
,,,00:15:46.400,00:15:48.220,ideally to two brothers.
00:15:47.960,00:15:49.830,这样咱们就可以天天在一起了,00:15:48.760,00:15:51.360,Then we could stay together for the rest of our lives.
00:15:52.480,00:15:55.870,可是现在咱们天天在一起,00:15:53.480,00:15:57.020,We are in the same place now.
00:15:57.600,00:15:58.950,却不想生疏至此,00:15:58.520,00:16:00.880,But I never imagined our hearts could drift so far.
00:16:01.000,00:16:05.230,姐姐 你是真要与我生分了吗,00:16:01.980,00:16:03.020,"Meizhuang,"
,,,00:16:04.660,00:16:06.920,do you really intend to drift apart?
00:16:07.960,00:16:10.150,天下无不散的筵席,00:16:09.060,00:16:11.440,"""Even the best banquet must come to an end."""
00:16:11.160,00:16:13.510,没有生分不生分这一说,00:16:12.200,00:16:14.560,It isn't a matter of drifting or not.
00:16:16.360,00:16:20.060,你回去吧 无事也不必再来了,00:16:17.220,00:16:18.440,"You can leave now,"
,,,00:16:19.080,00:16:21.080,and you need not visit if not necessary.
00:16:23.560,00:16:25.150,你总有一天会明白我的,00:16:24.400,00:16:26.380,You will understand me one day.
00:16:26.640,00:16:27.700,或许吧,00:16:27.500,00:16:28.960,Perhaps.
00:16:30.000,00:16:34.110,既然姐姐不喜欢人来打扰,00:16:30.860,00:16:32.280,"Meizhuang,"
,,,00:16:34.000,00:16:35.800,"since you don’t wish to be disturbed,"
00:16:37.560,00:16:39.590,那我便待到功成那一日再来吧,00:16:38.500,00:16:41.140,I won't return until my goal is achieved.
00:17:13.000,00:17:14.350,给皇后娘娘请安,,,
00:17:14.880,00:17:16.070,娘娘万福金安,00:17:14.120,00:17:16.920,Peace and grace to Your Majesty
00:17:16.760,00:17:18.710,臣妾给各位姐姐请安,,,
00:17:18.920,00:17:19.670,起来吧,00:17:17.920,00:17:20.440,"- Peace to Your Highnesses.
- Rise."
00:17:20.000,00:17:20.830,谢皇后娘娘,00:17:20.920,00:17:21.840,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:22.600,00:17:24.230,正好惠贵人也在,00:17:23.480,00:17:25.320,It's nice that Lady Vertu is here as well.
00:17:24.480,00:17:26.470,很久没见到你们一起过来了,00:17:25.320,00:17:27.680,I have not seen you together for a while.
00:17:29.560,00:17:30.870,臣妾侍奉太后,,,
00:17:31.080,00:17:32.350,所以不常出来走动,00:17:30.440,00:17:31.920,"I've been serving the Empress Dowager,"
00:17:33.040,00:17:34.070,现在差不多,00:17:31.920,00:17:33.620,so I rarely venture to other palaces.
00:17:34.400,00:17:36.070,是太后该吃药的时候了,00:17:34.020,00:17:37.260,It's about time for Her Majesty to take her medicine.
00:17:37.480,00:17:38.750,臣妾先告退,00:17:38.360,00:17:40.340,Please allow me to take my leave.
00:17:40.280,00:17:43.110,好啊 难得太后喜欢你,00:17:41.140,00:17:41.940,All right.
00:17:43.440,00:17:44.310,你就多去走走,00:17:42.540,00:17:45.200,"I'm glad Her Majesty likes you.
You should visit her as much as possible."
00:17:53.240,00:17:54.670,莞嫔 你先坐吧,00:17:54.120,00:17:56.060,"Concubine Sourire, why don't you take a seat?"
00:17:57.520,00:18:00.110,惠贵人她最近对人总是这个样子,00:17:58.580,00:18:01.260,"Lady Vertu has been behaving like that
to everyone recently."
00:18:00.600,00:18:01.740,你别放在心上,00:18:01.460,00:18:02.960,Don't let it worry you.
00:18:02.320,00:18:03.670,可能是时气所致,00:18:03.140,00:18:04.880,Perhaps it is because of the weather
00:18:04.240,00:18:06.110,所以眉姐姐身子总不大好,00:18:05.300,00:18:07.400,that Meizhuang has not been in good health?
00:18:06.680,00:18:08.470,时气所感是小事,00:18:07.600,00:18:09.640,The weather would not cause anything serious.
00:18:08.840,00:18:10.550,只是女人家身子娇贵,00:18:09.760,00:18:11.180,But women are fragile
00:18:10.840,00:18:11.900,得好好养着,00:18:11.420,00:18:12.980,and need to be taken better care of.
00:18:12.400,00:18:13.620,别和端妃一样,00:18:13.400,00:18:14.820,Don't be like Consort Honnête -
00:18:13.960,00:18:15.830,出了大毛病就不好了,00:18:14.820,00:18:16.760,she began to have great trouble with her health.
00:18:16.000,00:18:16.710,是,,,
00:18:17.120,00:18:18.230,皇上同本宫讲,00:18:16.840,00:18:17.800,Yes.
,,,00:18:18.100,00:18:19.400,His Majesty told me that
00:18:18.520,00:18:20.790,说你入宫后一直未见过家人,00:18:19.400,00:18:21.920,you haven't seen your family since you entered the palace.
00:18:21.240,00:18:24.150,本宫已经安排了你母亲今日入宫,00:18:22.280,00:18:25.380,I've arranged for your mother to visit you today.
00:18:24.560,00:18:25.990,你去碎玉轩等着吧,00:18:25.580,00:18:27.320,You can wait in the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:18:28.120,00:18:29.260,多谢皇后娘娘,00:18:29.060,00:18:30.640,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:31.160,00:18:32.510,好好去准备着吧,00:18:32.160,00:18:33.780,Go get ready for her visit.
00:18:32.880,00:18:35.550,午后你母亲和妹妹就会入宫了,00:18:33.860,00:18:36.600,Your mother and sister will arrive in the afternoon.
00:18:36.000,00:18:36.710,是,00:18:36.900,00:18:37.860,Yes.
00:18:37.880,00:18:39.350,大家也都散了吧,00:18:38.920,00:18:40.560,"Well then, you're all dismissed."
00:18:41.280,00:18:42.910,安贵人 你留下来,00:18:42.340,00:18:44.140,"Lady An, please stay behind."
00:18:43.800,00:18:44.430,是,00:18:44.740,00:18:45.520,Yes.
00:18:46.240,00:18:47.910,臣妾告退,00:18:47.280,00:18:49.120,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:19:00.800,00:19:01.430,娘娘,,,
00:19:02.000,00:19:03.270,刚才你都看见了吧,00:19:01.780,00:19:02.820,Your Majesty.
,,,00:19:02.920,00:19:04.740,"You saw what happened just now, right?"
00:19:04.880,00:19:06.990,惠贵人和莞嫔形同陌路,00:19:05.960,00:19:08.200,"Lady Vertu and Concubine Sourire
behave like strangers in the street."
00:19:07.600,00:19:09.150,惠贵人家世不低,00:19:08.720,00:19:10.500,Lady Vertu has a decent family background.
00:19:09.560,00:19:11.550,莞嫔的父亲又屡次升迁,00:19:10.520,00:19:12.740,"And Concubine Sourire's father has been
 promoted several times."
00:19:11.920,00:19:13.830,若是她两人一直朕手,00:19:12.860,00:19:14.800,"If they were united,"
00:19:14.120,00:19:15.910,那宫中的麻烦只怕会更多,00:19:15.000,00:19:17.380,I'm afraid it would only cause more trouble in the palace.
00:19:16.520,00:19:17.790,臣妾也是这样想,,,
00:19:18.120,00:19:19.260,等到惠贵人和莞嫔,00:19:17.440,00:19:18.980,I agree with Your Majesty.
00:19:19.720,00:19:21.990,与华妃一般盛势时就不好办了,00:19:19.060,00:19:22.820,"It would not be desirable if both Lady Vertu and Concubine
Sourire gained as much power as Consort Fleur."
00:19:22.280,00:19:24.150,你这句话很合本宫心意,00:19:23.060,00:19:25.060,I'm of the same mind.
00:19:25.240,00:19:27.070,皇上要宠谁都可以,00:19:26.240,00:19:28.680,"His Majesty can favor anyone he likes,"
00:19:27.960,00:19:29.590,只是如华妃一般的,,,
00:19:29.920,00:19:31.230,不能再有第二个了,00:19:29.040,00:19:32.200,but we can't allow a second Consort Fleur.
00:19:37.120,00:19:38.670,母亲 怎么走了这么久,,,
00:19:39.040,00:19:40.070,还没到姐姐宫里呀,00:19:38.100,00:19:41.100,"Mother, why are we still not at Huan's palace?"
00:19:40.520,00:19:43.390,少说话 这里是紫禁城,00:19:41.500,00:19:42.800,Don't complain.
,,,00:19:42.960,00:19:44.680,We're in the Forbidden City.
00:19:43.800,00:19:46.070,天下没有比这里更大的地方了,00:19:44.840,00:19:46.940,There's nowhere under heaven bigger than this.
00:19:46.440,00:19:47.350,自然走得久,00:19:47.100,00:19:48.600,That's why it's a long trip.
00:19:47.680,00:19:49.830,等下见了姐姐 不许乱说话,00:19:48.600,00:19:50.620,Don't say anything foolish when you see your sister.
00:19:50.080,00:19:50.630,知道了吗,,,
00:19:50.880,00:19:51.630,嗯,00:19:50.840,00:19:51.820,Do you understand?

00:20:19.880,00:20:21.990,母亲一路劳累了 快坐,00:20:20.680,00:20:23.160,"You must have had a very tiring trip, mother. Please sit."
00:20:22.680,00:20:23.270,浣碧上茶,,,
00:20:23.640,00:20:24.230,坐吧,00:20:23.700,00:20:25.440,"Bring the tea, Jade."
00:20:30.560,00:20:31.310,来,,,
00:20:34.720,00:20:35.990,娘娘身份贵重,00:20:35.480,00:20:37.660,Your Highness has become more distinguished in status
00:20:36.720,00:20:38.590,浣碧也出落得更漂亮了,00:20:37.660,00:20:39.820,and Jade has grown more beautiful.
00:20:39.720,00:20:40.550,多谢夫人,00:20:40.560,00:20:41.720,I thank Your Ladyship.
00:20:40.800,00:20:42.710,母亲难得来 也不夸夸我吗,00:20:41.820,00:20:44.040,"Mother, are you not going to compliment me?"
00:20:43.040,00:20:44.830,娘娘自然更漂亮了,00:20:44.040,00:20:46.080,Of course Your Highness has grown even more beautiful.
00:20:45.480,00:20:48.350,姐姐 你的鞋子真漂亮,00:20:46.620,00:20:49.500,"Sister, your shoes are so pretty."
00:20:50.600,00:20:53.190,这屋子里的一切都好漂亮啊,00:20:51.720,00:20:54.320,Everything in this chamber is so gorgeous.
00:20:53.800,00:20:54.390,玉烧,00:20:54.680,00:20:55.760,Yurao!
00:20:54.960,00:20:57.110,这双啊 只是小主平常的鞋子,00:20:56.040,00:20:58.260,These shoes are just My Lady's everyday shoes.
00:20:57.440,00:20:58.870,还有一双皇上赏的玉鞋,00:20:58.400,00:21:00.280,She has a pair of jade shoes gifted by His Majesty.
00:20:59.400,00:21:01.700,都是用蜀锦制成 缀满了珠宝,00:21:00.380,00:21:02.660,They are made of Shu Brocade and studded with jewels.
00:21:02.120,00:21:02.830,那才好看呢,00:21:02.660,00:21:03.760,These shoes don't even compare!
00:21:03.160,00:21:04.430,皇上是待娘娘好,00:21:03.960,00:21:05.540,His Majesty treats Your Highness very well.
00:21:04.880,00:21:06.470,一路上我便听说了,00:21:05.740,00:21:07.480,I heard that on my way here.
00:21:07.320,00:21:08.190,夫人请用茶,00:21:08.160,00:21:09.580,"Please have some tea, Your Ladyship."
00:21:08.720,00:21:10.910,这可是今年新上贡的雪顶含翠,00:21:09.620,00:21:12.040,"This is this year's ""snowdrop jade"",
a recent tribute to the palace."
00:21:11.320,00:21:14.430,这样名贵的茶 我不敢喝,00:21:13.220,00:21:15.340,It's too precious. I don't deserve to drink it.
00:21:14.800,00:21:17.260,母亲 再好也不过是茶叶,00:21:15.600,00:21:16.620,"Mother,"
,,,00:21:16.800,00:21:18.300,it's just a cup of tea.
00:21:17.960,00:21:20.420,女儿知道您喜欢喝茶 快喝吧,00:21:18.780,00:21:20.280,"I know you love tea,"
,,,00:21:20.720,00:21:21.580,please try some.
00:21:21.080,00:21:23.150,娘娘惦记 感激不尽,00:21:21.960,00:21:24.520,I'm grateful for Your Highness's concern.
00:21:24.560,00:21:25.540,这是夫人和二小姐,,,
00:21:25.920,00:21:26.710,最爱吃的点心,00:21:25.640,00:21:27.580,This is Your Ladyship's favorite dessert.
00:21:27.080,00:21:28.190,小主一早就备下了,,,
00:21:28.840,00:21:30.270,听说夫人和二小姐要来,00:21:27.900,00:21:29.560,My Lady prepared it early this morning.
00:21:30.640,00:21:32.110,小主高兴得不行呢,00:21:29.720,00:21:33.540,"My Lady was so happy to hear that
Your Ladyship would be visiting."
00:21:35.320,00:21:37.310,小主 方才安贵人派菊青,,,
00:21:37.640,00:21:38.350,送了些东西来,00:21:36.280,00:21:40.540,"My Lady, Lady An sent Daisy here
to present some gifts to Her Ladyship."
00:21:38.640,00:21:40.910,说是给夫人的 奴婢先收下了,00:21:40.980,00:21:42.520,I've set them aside.
00:21:43.400,00:21:44.310,你们先下去吧,00:21:44.240,00:21:45.320,You may go now.
00:21:44.640,00:21:45.990,我和母亲 妹妹好好说说话,00:21:45.540,00:21:47.020,I'd like to talk with my mother and sister.
00:21:46.480,00:21:47.190,是,00:21:47.380,00:21:48.280,Yes.
00:21:51.520,00:21:52.430,让姐姐看看你,00:21:52.380,00:21:53.860,"Let me look at you, Yurao."
00:22:00.480,00:22:01.150,小主,00:22:01.380,00:22:02.380,My Lady.
00:22:02.920,00:22:03.980,东西都送去了吗,,,
00:22:04.440,00:22:05.070,都送到了,00:22:03.920,00:22:05.180,Did you send the gifts over?
00:22:05.760,00:22:06.390,那就好,00:22:05.340,00:22:06.360,"Yes, My Lady."
00:22:07.040,00:22:08.390,那些可都是山东巡抚,00:22:06.600,00:22:07.640,Good.
00:22:08.680,00:22:10.070,特地进贡的东阿阿胶,00:22:08.020,00:22:11.380,"The Dong'e ejiao was specially offered by
the Governor of Shandong as a tribute."
00:22:10.600,00:22:12.150,大约甄夫人也看得上,00:22:11.620,00:22:13.800,I dare say it will be up to Her Ladyship's standards.
00:22:14.640,00:22:16.150,好了 你先下去吧,00:22:15.560,00:22:17.240,"Well, you can go now."
00:22:16.600,00:22:17.190,是,00:22:17.660,00:22:18.580,Yes.
00:22:20.360,00:22:21.390,凭她是谁,00:22:21.260,00:22:22.720,"No matter who she is,"
00:22:21.760,00:22:23.910,宫里赏的自然是好的,00:22:22.720,00:22:25.280,it's an honor to receive a gift from the palace.
00:22:26.960,00:22:28.910,记得我第一次入甄府的时候,00:22:28.080,00:22:30.220,"I remember when I stayed at their estate,"
00:22:29.800,00:22:31.310,看什么东西都是好的,00:22:30.980,00:22:32.940,everything there looked so exquisite to me.
00:22:32.600,00:22:34.430,什么东西都是我没见过的,00:22:33.540,00:22:35.780,Like nothing I'd ever seen.
00:22:36.200,00:22:39.030,如今 也终于有我赏他们些,00:22:37.200,00:22:38.100,Now
00:22:39.400,00:22:40.540,好东西的时候了,00:22:38.900,00:22:41.400,I can finally grant them something nice.
00:22:41.360,00:22:43.870,小主知恩图报 心肠仁厚,00:22:42.380,00:22:45.460,"My Lady, you're so kind and
generous in expressing your gratitude."
00:22:44.880,00:22:46.270,不只是知恩图报,00:22:45.880,00:22:47.320,"More than expressing my gratitude,"
00:22:47.360,00:22:50.790,而是终于今日是我在上,00:22:48.440,00:22:49.340,it‘s that
,,,00:22:49.980,00:22:51.520,I finally hold a superior status.
00:22:51.440,00:22:53.390,不再受别人的恩惠赏赐了,00:22:52.400,00:22:54.640,I'm not the one receiving gifts and graces anymore.
00:22:53.920,00:22:54.870,恭喜小主,00:22:54.840,00:22:56.240,"Congratulations, My Lady."
00:22:59.280,00:23:01.870,也不知我的父母什么时候,00:23:00.260,00:23:01.340,I wonder
00:23:02.240,00:23:03.220,能入宫来看我,00:23:01.760,00:23:03.940,when my parents will be able to visit me in the palace.
00:23:03.760,00:23:06.390,总会有这么一日的 小主安心,00:23:04.740,00:23:07.680,"Don't worry, My Lady. That day will come."
00:23:07.320,00:23:09.590,或许等小主有孕,00:23:08.280,00:23:08.780,Maybe ...
00:23:10.000,00:23:10.980,夫人也可以来呀,00:23:09.480,00:23:10.840,Her Ladyship will be able to come
00:23:12.120,00:23:13.430,可是现在皇后娘娘,00:23:10.920,00:23:12.520,"when you are pregnant, My Lady,"
00:23:13.840,00:23:14.820,还不许我怀孩子,00:23:12.960,00:23:16.000,"But Her Majesty is not allowing me
to conceive an imperial heir."
00:23:15.600,00:23:16.740,娘娘迟早肯的,00:23:16.460,00:23:18.160,"Her Majesty will, eventually."
00:23:20.360,00:23:21.580,与其等孩子,00:23:21.320,00:23:23.060,"Rather than waiting for a child,"
00:23:22.920,00:23:24.310,还不如等我的恩宠,,,
00:23:24.800,00:23:26.230,可与莞嫔比肩时,00:23:23.940,00:23:25.340,I'd prefer to wait until my favor
00:23:27.600,00:23:29.710,我母亲就可以来宫里,00:23:25.760,00:23:27.700,is equal to Concubine Sourire's.
00:23:30.040,00:23:31.180,风风光光看我了,00:23:28.380,00:23:32.000,Then my mother could visit the palace with tremendous pride.
00:23:32.560,00:23:34.990,姐姐 在宫里过得高不高兴,00:23:33.440,00:23:35.880,"Sister, are you happy living in the palace?"
00:23:35.280,00:23:36.260,姐夫对你好不好,00:23:36.100,00:23:37.760,How does my brother-in-law treat you?
00:23:37.080,00:23:42.630,姐夫 皇上待我是极好的,00:23:38.000,00:23:39.280,Brother-in-law?
,,,00:23:42.160,00:23:43.740,His Majesty treats me exceptionally well.
00:23:43.160,00:23:46.860,只是有时我总得想着说什么好,00:23:44.180,00:23:45.100,But sometimes
,,,00:23:45.360,00:23:46.340,I  need to be very careful
,,,00:23:46.940,00:23:47.840,"of what I say,"
00:23:47.400,00:23:50.030,说什么他才会高兴 也挺累的,00:23:48.140,00:23:50.060,and how I say it to please him.
00:23:50.600,00:23:51.870,所以姐姐瘦了,00:23:50.160,00:23:51.500,It's quite tiring.
00:23:52.160,00:23:53.510,是啊 我瘦了,00:23:51.500,00:23:53.100,So that's why you look thinner.
00:23:54.560,00:23:55.990,你定是正月里吃多了,00:23:53.100,00:23:54.620,"Yes, I'm thinner."
00:23:56.280,00:23:57.470,高了 也胖了,00:23:55.500,00:23:56.940,You must have eaten so much over the New Year.
,,,00:23:57.260,00:23:58.880,You look taller and chubbier than before.
00:23:59.000,00:24:01.460,娘娘瘦了一些 上回小产,00:23:59.820,00:24:01.440,Your Highness has lost some weight.
00:24:01.760,00:24:03.150,身子可都养好了吗,00:24:01.440,00:24:04.240,Has Your Highness recovered from your miscarriage?
00:24:03.560,00:24:05.470,温太医一直替我看着,00:24:04.560,00:24:06.540,Dr. Wen has been attending to my health.
00:24:05.880,00:24:06.790,已经好多了,00:24:06.780,00:24:08.280,It has improved a lot.
00:24:07.320,00:24:10.350,那就好 左右娘娘还年轻,00:24:08.500,00:24:09.360,That's a relief.
,,,00:24:09.840,00:24:11.440,"After all, Your Highness is so young."
00:24:11.080,00:24:12.300,等养好了身子,00:24:11.980,00:24:13.360,Your Highness will certainly have another child
00:24:12.760,00:24:14.310,一定还会有孩子的,00:24:13.760,00:24:15.440,when you've fully recovered.
00:24:15.080,00:24:18.670,何况 如今皇上待娘娘极好,00:24:16.140,00:24:19.720,"Besides, Your Highness is in high favor with His Majesty."
00:24:21.520,00:24:23.230,外人看我是风光无限,00:24:22.380,00:24:24.600,"To an outsider, it looks like I enjoy unending grandeur."
,,,00:24:25.040,00:24:25.760,"But in fact,"
00:24:24.040,00:24:28.830,可是 易求无价宝 难得有情郎,00:24:26.540,00:24:29.920,"I find that ""true affection is even
harder to come by than gold and treasures.”"
00:24:29.240,00:24:33.270,娘娘 含情欲说宫中事,00:24:30.140,00:24:30.800,"Your Highness,"
00:24:33.840,00:24:36.270,鹦鹉前头不敢言,00:24:32.340,00:24:38.080,your heart may overflow with palace woes but withhold your words in front of the parrot.
00:24:37.600,00:24:38.740,母亲这样谨慎,00:24:38.460,00:24:39.660,"Mother, you are very cautious."
00:24:39.040,00:24:40.630,哪怕是寻常夫妻间,,,
00:24:40.880,00:24:43.390,也少不得谨慎二字来保全恩爱,00:24:40.060,00:24:44.160,"Even for ordinary couples, you can never be too
careful in protecting your love and favor."
00:24:43.680,00:24:44.990,何况是帝王家,00:24:44.800,00:24:46.600,Let alone the imperial family.
00:24:46.280,00:24:48.630,娘娘与皇上还有君臣之分,00:24:47.280,00:24:50.200,His Majesty is also the monarch to Your Highness.
00:24:50.480,00:24:52.550,母亲的教诲 我都记着,00:24:51.520,00:24:53.720,"I'll remember your advice, mother."
00:24:53.240,00:24:54.270,除了对皇上,00:24:54.220,00:24:55.740,"Not only with His Majesty,"
00:24:54.840,00:24:56.630,其他也要事事谨慎,00:24:55.840,00:24:57.760,you need to be cautious in everything.
00:24:57.160,00:24:59.390,一个华妃就让你心力交瘁,00:24:58.120,00:25:00.620,"Consort Fleur has already exhausted you emotionally,"
00:24:59.840,00:25:02.070,何况宫里还有这许多人,00:25:00.860,00:25:03.520,but there are still many others in the palace.
00:25:05.120,00:25:07.190,娘娘心疼浣碧是不错,00:25:06.060,00:25:08.560,"There's nothing wrong with
Your Highness being partial to Jade."
00:25:07.760,00:25:09.950,但身边的侍女打扮得太好,00:25:08.700,00:25:11.160,"But if your maids dress so extravagantly,"
00:25:10.400,00:25:12.390,恐怕遭人侧目非议,00:25:11.360,00:25:13.560,it may furrow some eyebrows.
00:25:13.320,00:25:15.390,浣碧 流朱与我一同长大,00:25:14.300,00:25:16.380,Jade and Vermilion grew up with me.
00:25:15.720,00:25:16.470,情同姐妹,00:25:16.560,00:25:18.000,They are like sisters to me.
00:25:18.280,00:25:22.230,情同姐妹 毕竟也不是亲姐妹,00:25:18.660,00:25:20.740,They are like your sisters.
,,,00:25:21.400,00:25:23.680,"But after all, they're not your sisters."
00:25:22.920,00:25:24.950,这才是你的亲妹妹,00:25:23.840,00:25:25.660,This is your sister.
00:25:27.640,00:25:31.030,宫门一入深似海 我也罢了,00:25:28.580,00:25:30.820,"Once you enter the palace, its vastness swallows you."
00:25:32.320,00:25:33.630,给玉烧指个好人家,00:25:31.280,00:25:33.000,There's no point worrying about me.
,,,00:25:33.260,00:25:35.220,We need to find a good family for Yurao.
00:25:34.880,00:25:36.020,平平安安就好了,00:25:35.680,00:25:37.420,So she can live an ordinary peaceful life.
00:25:37.640,00:25:41.590,玉烧的性子最像娘娘 恐怕难哪,00:25:38.640,00:25:41.080,Her personality is a lot like Your Highness's.
,,,00:25:41.300,00:25:43.180,I'm afraid that might be difficult.
00:25:43.920,00:25:45.310,所以我不敢不争气呀,00:25:44.920,00:25:46.400,That's why I have to bring honor to my family.
00:25:45.840,00:25:47.990,为了父亲母亲 也为了玉烧,00:25:46.660,00:25:49.120,"For you, for father, and also for Yurao."
00:25:48.320,00:25:50.270,你的心思家里都知道,00:25:49.320,00:25:51.520,We know how you feel.
00:25:51.480,00:25:53.430,你父亲也是日夜忧愁,00:25:52.420,00:25:54.640,Your father is so worried day and night.
00:25:54.160,00:25:56.670,只恨不能在前朝多为你出力,00:25:55.100,00:25:58.060,He regrets that wasn't able to do more for you in court
00:25:57.600,00:26:00.110,才好保得住你在后宫平安,00:25:58.540,00:26:01.660,so that your life could be peaceful in the harem.
00:26:05.640,00:26:06.950,娘娘 时辰到了,00:26:06.640,00:26:07.960,"Your Highness,"
00:26:07.360,00:26:08.750,夫人和二小姐该回府了,00:26:08.260,00:26:10.560,it's time for Her Ladyship and your sister to return.
00:26:12.880,00:26:15.180,娘娘 我们该走了,00:26:13.820,00:26:16.300,"Your Highness, we should be leaving."
00:26:17.520,00:26:18.660,怎么刚来就要走啊,,,
00:26:19.200,00:26:20.390,母亲也不多陪陪我,00:26:18.460,00:26:20.200,"You just got here, now you're leaving?"
00:26:21.840,00:26:23.510,来得久了宫中不便,00:26:20.200,00:26:21.940,Can't you stay for longer?
,,,00:26:22.780,00:26:25.340,It's not appropriate to stay in the palace for too long
00:26:24.760,00:26:26.870,也免得人说你恃宠而骄,00:26:25.700,00:26:28.640,lest anyone say you have grown conceited over your favor.
00:26:27.960,00:26:29.950,其实你父亲也不愿我来,00:26:28.900,00:26:31.260,"Actually, your father did not want me to visit."
00:26:30.520,00:26:32.470,总怕人说是外戚之故,00:26:31.460,00:26:33.720,Others will see it as a privilege granted to your family.
00:26:34.920,00:26:38.510,我这一回去 也不知什么时候,00:26:35.880,00:26:37.520,"After I leave,"
00:26:38.800,00:26:40.510,才能再入宫来看娘娘,00:26:38.320,00:26:41.220,I don't know when I will be able to see Your Highness again.
00:26:44.480,00:26:48.910,万事 唯有要靠娘娘自己了,00:26:45.420,00:26:46.960,Your Highness
,,,00:26:47.980,00:26:50.480,will have only yourself to count on.
00:26:53.040,00:26:53.790,母亲放心,00:26:53.980,00:26:55.460,"Mother, don't worry."
00:27:00.840,00:27:01.510,走吧,00:27:01.520,00:27:02.340,Let's go.
00:27:07.520,00:27:08.950,莞嫔的家人入宫了,00:27:08.540,00:27:10.560,Sourire's family came to visit.
00:27:10.240,00:27:11.460,略坐坐就走了,00:27:11.280,00:27:12.800,They only stayed briefly.
00:27:12.800,00:27:15.710,难为她 家人进趟宫不容易,00:27:13.740,00:27:15.180,That must be hard on her.
,,,00:27:15.180,00:27:17.060,It's not easy for her to see her family.
00:27:16.360,00:27:18.710,从前本宫的家人倒是常来,00:27:17.480,00:27:19.840,My family used to visit frequently.
00:27:19.560,00:27:23.310,往后这莞嫔也能够得上这荣宠了,00:27:20.500,00:27:24.260,Now Concubine Sourire has finally managed to earn this honor.
00:27:24.480,00:27:26.310,皇上升了莞嫔父亲的官,00:27:25.420,00:27:27.500,His Majesty promoted her father.
00:27:26.560,00:27:28.510,也不过是给点脸面敷衍敷衍,00:27:27.500,00:27:29.960,But it is only a matter of expediency.
00:27:29.320,00:27:33.430,再怎么升也就是个言官 没出息,00:27:30.260,00:27:32.940,He's still a civil official after all.
00:27:34.440,00:27:36.030,皇上驾到,00:27:33.320,00:27:34.920,He has no prospects.
00:27:38.000,00:27:39.220,笑什么呢 这么热闹,00:27:35.800,00:27:37.460,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:27:39.720,00:27:40.550,皇上万安,00:27:38.940,00:27:40.380,What's so funny?
00:27:41.440,00:27:42.110,起来吧,00:27:40.660,00:27:41.940,Peace to Your Majesty.
,,,00:27:42.380,00:27:43.400,Rise.
00:27:44.680,00:27:46.630,臣妾正跟颂芝开玩笑呢,00:27:45.620,00:27:47.580,"I was just joking with Song Zhi,"
00:27:47.000,00:27:48.430,说这天气越来越热,00:27:47.940,00:27:49.880,"saying how the weather is getting hotter and hotter,"
00:27:48.760,00:27:51.110,要跟皇上到圆明园去避暑,00:27:49.880,00:27:52.060,"and how I would love to
go to the Summer Palace with Your Majesty."
00:27:51.400,00:27:52.310,否则留在宫里呀,,,
00:27:52.760,00:27:54.070,都成烤红薯了,00:27:52.280,00:27:55.260,"If we stay here, we will become roasted yams."
00:27:54.520,00:27:56.590,朕哪次去圆明园 没带上你,00:27:55.400,00:27:57.860,When have I ever been to the Summer Palace without you?
00:27:58.160,00:28:00.150,皇上 净了手用膳吧,00:27:59.100,00:28:01.100,"- Your Majesty, let's eat after you've washed your hands
- Certainly."
00:28:00.320,00:28:00.870,好,,,
00:28:01.120,00:28:02.310,臣妾让厨房备了好多,,,
00:28:02.680,00:28:03.310,皇上爱吃的菜,00:28:01.920,00:28:04.440,"I had my kitchen prepare many of
Your Majesty's favorite dishes."
00:28:03.520,00:28:04.150,好啊,00:28:04.460,00:28:05.500,Great!
00:28:20.680,00:28:22.270,这药粉加了什么香料,00:28:21.620,00:28:23.780,What did you add to the herbal powder?
00:28:23.120,00:28:24.150,与从前不同了,00:28:24.060,00:28:25.260,It's different than before.
00:28:24.360,00:28:27.030,从前用的是甘松 吴白芷 桂枝,00:28:25.260,00:28:28.500,"It used to be made with spikenard, angelica,
cassia twig and bamboo leaves"
00:28:27.360,00:28:28.710,和竹叶泡猪胰后,,,
00:28:29.200,00:28:30.870,日暴干研末做的洗手药,00:28:28.500,00:28:30.200,soaked with pork spleen.
00:28:31.440,00:28:33.350,娘娘因不喜桂枝的气味,00:28:30.200,00:28:32.400,This was then sun-dried and crushed into the washing powder.
00:28:33.680,00:28:34.900,所以改用了木兰皮,00:28:32.400,00:28:34.420,"Her Highness dislikes the smell of cassia twig,"
00:28:35.240,00:28:36.270,又加了一味白檀,00:28:34.455,00:28:37.215,"so I used magnolia bark instead,
and added sandalwood."
00:28:36.560,00:28:38.940,洗起来更滋润 味道也好闻,00:28:37.500,00:28:40.140,It's more moisturizing and fragrant.
00:28:39.320,00:28:41.910,从前竟不知道你懂得这些,00:28:40.260,00:28:43.180,I didn't know you were so well-versed in such things.
00:28:42.280,00:28:43.420,娘娘用东西仔细,,,
00:28:44.040,00:28:45.790,奴婢都是留心着 拣选着,00:28:43.220,00:28:45.100,Her Highness is careful about everything she uses.
00:28:46.160,00:28:46.950,替娘娘试用,00:28:45.100,00:28:48.180,So I always select them attentively and try them out first.
00:28:47.680,00:28:48.990,也亏你懂得这些,00:28:48.620,00:28:50.280,It's fortunate that you know all this
00:28:49.680,00:28:50.870,自己的手又白,00:28:50.620,00:28:52.540,and your hands are also quite fair.
00:28:51.520,00:28:53.790,所以华妃才肯用你试过的,00:28:52.540,00:28:55.200,"That's why Consort Fleur would trust
what you've tried for her."
00:28:54.840,00:28:56.790,朕记得你叫颂芝,00:28:55.780,00:28:58.140,Your name is... Song Zhi?
00:28:59.480,00:29:02.070,回皇上的话 奴婢姓乔,00:29:00.420,00:29:03.020,"Your Majesty, my family name is Qiao."
00:29:02.360,00:29:04.070,颂芝是娘娘赐的名字,00:29:03.200,00:29:05.760,The name Song Zhi was granted to me by Her Highness.
00:29:05.240,00:29:07.830,芝兰玉树 好名字,00:29:06.180,00:29:09.420,"Zhi as in angelica, a fragrant herb and a sweet name."
00:29:11.160,00:29:11.870,用膳吧,,,
00:29:12.480,00:29:13.150,是,00:29:12.100,00:29:13.140,Let's eat.
,,,00:29:13.420,00:29:14.440,Yes.
00:29:21.800,00:29:23.190,叫下人做就是了,00:29:22.720,00:29:24.460,Just have the servants do it.
00:29:23.880,00:29:25.100,何必你亲自动手,00:29:24.820,00:29:26.840,You don't need to serve me yourself.
00:29:27.320,00:29:30.350,颂芝 你来替朕布菜,00:29:28.260,00:29:29.600,"Song Zhi,"
,,,00:29:30.060,00:29:31.940,come here and serve me.
00:29:34.680,00:29:37.310,皇上让你布菜 好好做就是了,00:29:35.520,00:29:38.780,"His Majesty asked you to serve him, do it carefully."
00:29:38.960,00:29:39.630,是,00:29:39.900,00:29:40.620,Yes.
00:29:55.480,00:29:58.230,你宫里的小厨房味道是好,00:29:56.420,00:29:59.240,Your kitchen makes excellent food.
00:29:59.200,00:30:00.710,皇上喜欢就最好,,,
00:30:01.000,00:30:02.470,若是皇上不喜欢的,00:30:00.280,00:30:02.020,It's only good if Your Majesty likes it.
00:30:02.960,00:30:04.470,味道再好都是不好的,00:30:02.020,00:30:05.500,"Otherwise, it's not good at all, regardless of the taste."
00:30:05.240,00:30:07.190,你这话大有深意啊,00:30:06.180,00:30:08.200,What profound words!
00:30:07.600,00:30:09.110,臣妾最不会说话了,00:30:08.580,00:30:10.340,I am the worst with words.
00:30:09.560,00:30:12.020,你身边有的是会说话的人,00:30:10.540,00:30:13.120,But your servants are very articulate.
00:30:12.840,00:30:14.060,可见你会调教,00:30:13.780,00:30:15.780,You've had a good influence on them.
00:30:18.320,00:30:19.350,皇上说得是,00:30:19.260,00:30:20.660,Your Majesty is right.
00:30:21.560,00:30:22.670,我许久不见姐姐,,,
00:30:23.000,00:30:25.110,和莞姐姐在一起了 这是怎么了,00:30:23.160,00:30:25.200,"Vertu, I haven't seen you spending time with Sourire recently."
,,,00:30:25.280,00:30:26.620,What happened?
00:30:26.480,00:30:28.990,皇上常去她那儿 我不便过去,00:30:27.400,00:30:30.180,"His Majesty visits her frequently,
so it's not convenient for me to see her."
00:30:29.480,00:30:30.910,又要忙着伺候太后,00:30:30.500,00:30:32.180,"And I've been busy serving the Empress Dowager,"
00:30:31.440,00:30:32.580,是而碰不到了,00:30:32.340,00:30:33.940,so I haven't had a chance to run into her.
00:30:33.120,00:30:35.500,那就好 原是我多心了,00:30:34.080,00:30:35.280,That's a relief.
00:30:35.920,00:30:37.950,见姐姐和莞姐姐总不在一块,00:30:35.380,00:30:36.820,I was overthinking.
00:30:38.480,00:30:40.270,还以为咱们姐妹生分了呢,00:30:37.140,00:30:39.280,I thought the three of us were drifting apart
00:30:41.000,00:30:42.430,你怎会这么认为,00:30:39.460,00:30:41.520,as we haven't seen each other much recently.
00:30:43.080,00:30:44.790,若是大家亲如姐妹,00:30:42.020,00:30:43.920,What makes you think that?
00:30:45.040,00:30:48.310,彼此坦诚相对 又怎么会生分,00:30:44.160,00:30:47.280,"As sisters, we are always honest with each other."
,,,00:30:47.500,00:30:49.020,Why would we ever drift?
00:30:49.520,00:30:52.150,原是妹妹多心 才问了这么一句,00:30:50.520,00:30:53.400,"I should not have asked such a question,
I thought over it too much."
00:30:52.880,00:30:53.830,姐姐别见怪,,,
00:30:54.960,00:30:55.940,你爱多心,00:30:53.760,00:30:55.220,I apologize.
00:30:56.200,00:30:57.950,我又不是第一日才知道,00:30:56.040,00:30:58.980,I know you often overthink things.
00:30:58.440,00:31:00.350,否则也不会巴巴儿地,,,
00:31:00.640,00:31:01.430,跑来告诉我,00:30:59.540,00:31:02.340,"Otherwise, you wouldn't have kindly made the trip"
00:31:01.720,00:31:03.910,莞嫔劝皇上重定华妃的事,00:31:02.540,00:31:05.100,"to let me know about Concubine Sourire's
role in reinstating Consort Fleur."
00:31:04.960,00:31:07.910,关心则乱 我也是担心两位姐姐,00:31:05.840,00:31:08.960,"I told you because I was worried.
I care about you and Sourire."
00:31:08.400,00:31:10.910,担心 若真是担心,00:31:09.320,00:31:10.380,Do you?
00:31:11.360,00:31:13.790,便不会借宝鹃的嘴说与我听,00:31:10.640,00:31:12.220,"If you really cared,"
00:31:14.400,00:31:15.750,莞嫔行事不正,00:31:12.360,00:31:15.180,you wouldn't have had Coua telling me that on your behalf.
00:31:16.440,00:31:18.030,你也未必坦坦荡荡,00:31:15.320,00:31:17.280,What Concubine Sourire did was not right.
,,,00:31:17.460,00:31:20.020,"But did you really tell me out of
the goodness of your heart?"
00:31:19.280,00:31:21.550,姐姐说这话便是错怪妹妹了,00:31:20.340,00:31:22.820,"You have misunderstood me, Vertu."
00:31:22.160,00:31:24.870,我与姐姐同仇敌忾 厌憎华妃,00:31:23.260,00:31:26.120,I resent Consort Fleur in the same way you do.
00:31:25.400,00:31:27.780,才会担心莞姐姐一时糊涂,00:31:26.460,00:31:29.040,So I was worried that Sourire was doing something foolish.
00:31:28.120,00:31:29.390,你若担心她糊涂,00:31:29.200,00:31:30.660,"If you were worried about her,"
00:31:29.840,00:31:31.510,说与她自己知道就是,00:31:30.840,00:31:32.860,you could have told her directly.
00:31:34.040,00:31:34.950,姐姐别生气,,,
00:31:35.680,00:31:37.270,都是陵容胆小又多话,00:31:35.080,00:31:36.600,"Please don't be mad, Vertu."
00:31:37.800,00:31:38.860,才惹姐姐生气,00:31:36.780,00:31:38.720,I'm not good at communicating my heart
00:31:39.520,00:31:40.390,不必了,00:31:38.800,00:31:40.320,and ended up making you upset.
00:31:40.760,00:31:42.670,你有这个工夫和我解释,00:31:40.480,00:31:41.700,Forget it.
00:31:43.000,00:31:45.150,还不如留着力气去讨好皇上,00:31:41.780,00:31:43.960,"If you have time to explain yourself to me,"
00:31:45.640,00:31:47.590,力劝皇上惩治华妃,00:31:44.080,00:31:46.480,"you might as well put some effort into
getting into His Majesty's good graces"
00:31:49.000,00:31:50.030,都是妹妹无能,00:31:46.660,00:31:49.100,and convincing him to punish Consort Fleur.
00:31:50.400,00:31:51.270,无能是小,00:31:49.860,00:31:51.320,I do not have the ability to convince him.
00:31:51.800,00:31:54.030,若是心术不正 挑拨是非,00:31:51.380,00:31:52.760,Inability isn't an issue.
00:31:54.320,00:31:56.150,坏了德行 那才是大事,00:31:52.880,00:31:57.380,"What is an issue, is having a corrupt heart and intentionally driving a wedge between people."
00:31:57.200,00:31:58.310,姐姐教诲的是,00:31:58.140,00:31:59.680,I appreciate your advice.
00:31:58.680,00:32:02.150,不是我要教诲你 大家相识一场,00:31:59.820,00:32:01.620,I had no intention to give any advice.
00:32:02.520,00:32:04.750,有什么话当面说也就罢了,00:32:01.800,00:32:03.560,"We've known each other for a while,"
,,,00:32:03.560,00:32:06.160,so we can speak to one another directly.
00:32:05.480,00:32:08.270,又何必欲擒故纵 步步为营,00:32:06.480,00:32:09.260,We don't have to speak to each other sideways.
00:32:08.560,00:32:09.750,也太辛苦了些,00:32:09.500,00:32:10.920,That is just tiring.
00:32:10.720,00:32:12.790,以后你若再有这样的话,00:32:11.480,00:32:13.880,"If you have such concerns in the future,"
00:32:13.200,00:32:15.030,自己说给她知道便是了,00:32:14.140,00:32:16.200,you can tell her yourself.
00:32:15.800,00:32:17.310,不必再来说给我听,00:32:16.720,00:32:18.540,I don't need to hear it.
00:32:24.240,00:32:25.870,惠贵人说话真不留情面,,,
00:32:26.360,00:32:27.630,奴婢觉得她不得宠,00:32:25.400,00:32:27.280,Lady Vertu was very plain-spoken.
00:32:28.040,00:32:29.350,性子也变得厉害了,00:32:27.360,00:32:28.960,It seems her temperament became tougher
,,,00:32:29.140,00:32:30.460,since she fell out of favor.
00:32:29.640,00:32:32.670,她一直是这样的性子 何曾变过,00:32:30.460,00:32:32.400,Her temperament has always been like this.
,,,00:32:32.900,00:32:34.040,It never changed.
00:32:37.080,00:32:38.270,他们手里拿的是什么,00:32:38.000,00:32:39.680,What are they carrying?
00:32:39.280,00:32:41.070,这条路是通往碎玉轩的,00:32:40.300,00:32:42.400,This road leads to the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:32:42.360,00:32:44.150,大概是给碎玉轩送补药的吧,00:32:43.200,00:32:45.200,It's probably some herbal tonics.
00:32:45.000,00:32:46.630,莞嫔还在喝进补的药吗,,,
00:32:47.280,00:32:48.830,听说莞嫔娘娘小产后,00:32:46.060,00:32:47.960,Is Concubine Sourire still taking tonics?
00:32:49.320,00:32:50.460,身子还是虚,00:32:48.360,00:32:51.520,"I heard that Her Highness's constitution
has been weak since her miscarriage"
00:32:50.920,00:32:52.550,所以皇上特意下旨调理,00:32:51.940,00:32:53.780,so His Majesty specially ordered some herbs for her.
00:32:53.160,00:32:55.620,果然了 我们三个人,00:32:54.280,00:32:55.480,"As expected,"
00:32:56.400,00:32:58.110,终究是莞嫔最得宠,00:32:55.800,00:32:57.260,"of the three of us,"
,,,00:32:57.480,00:32:59.640,Concubine Sourire gained the highest favor in the end.
00:32:58.880,00:33:02.070,皇后娘娘说得对 莞嫔得宠,00:32:59.960,00:33:01.820,Her Majesty is right.
,,,00:33:02.000,00:33:03.820,"While Concubine Sourire is in favor,"
00:33:02.880,00:33:07.190,谁和莞嫔交好 境遇自然会好些,00:33:03.960,00:33:05.680,being close with her
,,,00:33:05.860,00:33:08.260,is also being close to favor.
00:33:07.600,00:33:10.190,可是莞嫔娘娘病愈后,00:33:08.560,00:33:11.340,"But after Concubine Sourire's recovery,"
00:33:10.720,00:33:12.270,便和小主少来往了,00:33:11.760,00:33:13.740,"she stopped seeing you so frequently, My Lady."
00:33:12.920,00:33:15.350,姐姐少来 我可以去,00:33:13.940,00:33:16.680,"If she doesn't visit me, I'll just go visit her."
00:33:17.240,00:33:19.350,去太医院请人开个好的方子,00:33:18.340,00:33:20.460,Ask for a good formula from the Imperial Infirmary
00:33:19.800,00:33:20.830,拣一剂补药回来,00:33:20.860,00:33:22.340,and collect the herbs accordingly.
00:33:21.760,00:33:22.390,是,00:33:22.640,00:33:23.620,Yes.
00:33:34.960,00:33:36.990,刚才还能言善道的,00:33:36.060,00:33:38.100,You were impressively verbose at dinner.
00:33:38.000,00:33:40.630,怎么这会儿一句话都没有了,00:33:39.040,00:33:41.540,Why have you gone so quiet now?
00:33:41.800,00:33:42.550,娘娘恕罪,00:33:42.620,00:33:44.320,I beg Your Highness's forgiveness.
00:33:43.200,00:33:46.270,恕罪 你做错什么了,00:33:44.340,00:33:45.940,What did you do wrong
00:33:47.520,00:33:48.660,不就是喜欢在皇上面前,00:33:46.200,00:33:47.780,that I need to forgive?
00:33:49.080,00:33:49.910,晃你那双爪子吗,00:33:48.280,00:33:51.020,"Weren't you pleased with yourself
waving your paws about before His Majesty!"
00:33:50.320,00:33:52.350,娘娘娘娘,00:33:51.160,00:33:52.420,"- I ...
- Your Highness."
00:33:53.040,00:33:54.870,这梳子您要是不喜欢,00:33:52.680,00:33:53.800,Your Highness.
,,,00:33:54.080,00:33:56.120,"If Your Highness dislikes this comb,"
00:33:55.240,00:33:57.910,就赏给奴才吧 丢了怪可惜的,00:33:56.160,00:33:57.620,you can give it to me as a reward.
,,,00:33:57.620,00:33:59.500,It would be a pity to throw it away.
00:33:59.480,00:34:02.150,颂芝姑娘 外面的药罐子里,00:34:00.380,00:34:01.640,"Song Zhi,"
00:34:02.480,00:34:03.870,还炖着娘娘的坐胎药呢,00:34:02.240,00:34:05.140,Her Highness's prenatal tonics are brewing outside.
00:34:04.640,00:34:05.550,你去看着火啊,00:34:05.640,00:34:07.240,Why don't you go watch over the stove?
00:34:14.200,00:34:15.230,娘娘别生气,,,
00:34:15.680,00:34:17.430,皇上只是随口夸了一句,00:34:15.240,00:34:16.600,Your Highness need not be angry.
00:34:17.840,00:34:18.710,能有什么呀,00:34:16.700,00:34:18.540,It was just a mindless compliment from His Majesty.
00:34:19.200,00:34:20.470,娘娘要是真的生气了,00:34:18.820,00:34:20.300,It doesn't mean anything.
00:34:20.920,00:34:23.590,那皇上知道了可要真生气了,00:34:20.300,00:34:24.460,"His Majesty will not be pleased if he knows
Your Highness got angry about it."
00:34:24.080,00:34:25.030,现在连本宫身边,,,
00:34:25.440,00:34:26.790,都出现这样的狐媚子,00:34:25.200,00:34:27.640,Now even my own palace has a sly minx!
00:34:28.000,00:34:31.390,嘴快伶俐 没事还晃她那双爪子,00:34:28.760,00:34:30.560,Quick-witted and honey-mouthed
00:34:32.080,00:34:33.910,娘娘 这宫里的女人,00:34:30.780,00:34:32.960,and waving her paws about over nothing!
00:34:34.520,00:34:36.110,哪个不是给皇上看的,00:34:33.100,00:34:35.220,"Your Highness, all the women in the palace"
00:34:36.840,00:34:38.060,娘娘在意皇上没错,00:34:35.540,00:34:37.260,are here to serve His Majesty.
00:34:38.640,00:34:40.870,可是眼下娘娘刚刚复宠,00:34:37.860,00:34:39.640,I understand that Your Highness cares for His Majesty.
00:34:41.480,00:34:43.270,就算皇上真的喜欢颂芝姑娘,00:34:39.740,00:34:42.300,"But since Your Highness has just regained favor,"
00:34:43.840,00:34:45.110,您也要装得大度些,00:34:42.440,00:34:44.660,"even if His Majesty is fond of Song Zhi,"
00:34:45.680,00:34:46.630,不要让皇上觉得,00:34:44.760,00:34:46.540,Your Highness has to act generously.
00:34:47.120,00:34:48.790,您忌妒 不能容人,00:34:46.700,00:34:48.160,So that His Majesty does not feel that
00:34:49.360,00:34:51.310,娘娘 您最重要的,00:34:48.260,00:34:50.260,Your Highness is jealous or intolerant.
00:34:51.800,00:34:53.390,是皇上的欢心哪,00:34:50.360,00:34:52.420,"Your Highness, what matters most"
00:34:54.440,00:34:56.110,本宫明天就打发她出去,00:34:52.820,00:34:54.640,is His Majesty's favor.
00:34:56.680,00:34:57.660,不让她见皇上,00:34:55.420,00:34:57.460,I will banish her from the palace tomorrow.
00:34:58.880,00:35:00.020,娘娘心里生气,00:34:57.660,00:34:59.400,She can't see His Majesty again.
00:35:00.320,00:35:01.910,但面子上不要露出来,00:34:59.920,00:35:02.820,Your Highness should not reveal any anger on your face.
00:35:02.240,00:35:03.380,而且当着皇上的面,,,
00:35:03.680,00:35:05.310,还要尤其对颂芝姑娘好,00:35:03.200,00:35:06.660,"Rather, when Your Highness is with His Majesty,
you must be particularly nice to Song Zhi."
00:35:05.880,00:35:07.910,这样皇上就会觉得您大度,00:35:06.940,00:35:09.300,"This way, His Majesty will perceive your generosity"
00:35:08.600,00:35:11.510,也可以拿这个堵住众人的嘴啊,00:35:09.660,00:35:12.600,and it will stop the gossip in the palace.
00:35:12.560,00:35:14.350,本宫本来就没什么见不得人的,00:35:13.300,00:35:15.600,I have nothing to be ashamed of!
00:35:15.360,00:35:17.950,娘娘 人言可畏啊,00:35:16.000,00:35:19.160,"Your Highness, rumors can be truly frightful."
00:35:19.240,00:35:20.550,本宫害怕流言吗,00:35:20.320,00:35:22.380,You think I'm afraid of rumors?
00:35:22.840,00:35:24.990,本宫就是怕皇上相信流言,00:35:23.660,00:35:26.580,I only fear that His Majesty might believe them.
00:35:26.920,00:35:27.790,奴才就知道,,,
00:35:28.120,00:35:29.990,娘娘心里最在意的就是皇上,00:35:27.960,00:35:31.160,I know Your Highness cares about His Majesty the most.
00:35:37.880,00:35:39.020,把这个赏给颂芝吧,00:35:38.880,00:35:40.360,Reward this to Song Zhi.
00:35:39.640,00:35:41.430,娘娘圣明 奴才这就去办,00:35:40.700,00:35:43.080,"Your Highness is enlightened.
I will go give it to her now."
00:35:52.840,00:35:55.350,宝鹃 把药端过来,00:35:53.800,00:35:56.320,"Coua, bring over the medicine."
00:36:02.160,00:36:02.910,煎好了,00:36:03.060,00:36:04.180,Is it ready?
00:36:03.880,00:36:06.470,按照您的吩咐都煎好了,00:36:04.180,00:36:07.360,"Yes, as you bade me, My Lady."
00:36:07.120,00:36:08.590,是用最好的药材吗,00:36:08.140,00:36:09.960,Did you use herbs of the finest quality?
00:36:09.320,00:36:10.270,都是最好的,00:36:10.360,00:36:11.740,Only the best.
00:36:11.000,00:36:13.670,那就好 莞姐姐身子弱,00:36:12.000,00:36:13.080,Good.
00:36:14.480,00:36:15.870,是得好好补补,00:36:13.540,00:36:14.940,Sourire is frail.
,,,00:36:15.420,00:36:17.160,She needs the nourishment.
00:36:26.680,00:36:27.660,小主 您要干吗,00:36:27.480,00:36:29.100,"What are you doing, My Lady?"
00:36:29.040,00:36:29.870,这么好的药,,,
00:36:30.360,00:36:31.550,没有药引子怎么行,00:36:30.040,00:36:32.600,Even the best ingredients call for a catalyst.
00:36:32.080,00:36:33.060,人血是最好的,,,
00:36:33.600,00:36:34.990,小主玉体 怎可损伤,00:36:33.040,00:36:34.460,Human blood is the best catalyst.
00:36:35.720,00:36:36.550,还是让奴婢来吧,00:36:34.600,00:36:36.240,"My Lady, your noble body cannot be damaged."
00:36:36.760,00:36:37.510,不用 我来,00:36:36.520,00:36:37.580,Please take my blood instead.
00:36:37.920,00:36:39.270,小主 还是奴婢来吧,00:36:37.580,00:36:38.800,"No, I can do it."
00:36:39.440,00:36:40.070,不用,00:36:38.960,00:36:40.240,"My Lady, please don't."
,,,00:36:40.380,00:36:41.340,Stop!
00:36:57.520,00:36:59.750,浣碧 什么时辰了,00:36:58.440,00:37:00.680,"Jade, what time is it?"
00:37:02.640,00:37:03.510,姐姐醒了,00:37:03.800,00:37:05.300,"Sourire, you woke up."
00:37:08.280,00:37:09.110,你怎么来了,,,
00:37:09.560,00:37:11.030,妹妹在自己宫里熬的药,00:37:09.260,00:37:10.600,Why are you here?
00:37:11.440,00:37:12.660,拿来姐姐这里温着,00:37:10.680,00:37:12.360,I brewed this tonic in my palace
00:37:14.320,00:37:16.030,是按着温太医的方子抓的,00:37:12.360,00:37:14.280,It's been kept warm on the stove.
00:37:16.440,00:37:18.030,又添了几味进补的药材,00:37:15.320,00:37:17.380,It was prepared according to Dr. Wen's formula
00:37:18.360,00:37:20.350,姐姐喝了便很快能痊愈,00:37:17.420,00:37:19.280,with a few additional nourishing herbs.
,,,00:37:19.280,00:37:21.680,You will have a speedy recovery if you take this.
00:37:22.480,00:37:23.700,可是温太医近来,00:37:23.500,00:37:25.360,But Dr. Wen has not
00:37:25.480,00:37:27.070,并没有开新的药方给我,00:37:26.440,00:37:28.700,prescribed new herbs for me recently.
00:37:38.800,00:37:40.110,姐姐快趁热喝了吧,00:37:39.800,00:37:41.960,You should have some while it's warm.
00:37:53.000,00:37:54.870,这什么药啊 腥味这么重,00:37:53.940,00:37:56.340,What's in the tonic? It has a strong smell.
00:37:56.400,00:37:56.990,来,00:37:57.220,00:37:58.560,Here.
00:38:03.360,00:38:04.340,姐姐别怕,00:38:04.280,00:38:05.640,Don't worry.
00:38:04.720,00:38:07.180,妹妹已经喝过了 没事的,00:38:05.740,00:38:08.200,I've had some of it. It's safe.
00:38:11.440,00:38:12.750,姐姐难道信不过我,00:38:12.440,00:38:14.000,"Do you not trust me, Sourire?"
00:38:18.280,00:38:19.070,这是怎么了,00:38:19.200,00:38:20.460,What happened to your wrist?
,,,00:38:20.460,00:38:21.340,Oh ...
00:38:20.680,00:38:23.140,没什么 不小心伤到的,00:38:21.720,00:38:24.180,"Nothing, it was an accident."
00:38:25.520,00:38:26.350,手怎么了,00:38:26.600,00:38:27.920,What happened?
00:38:30.680,00:38:31.590,你的手怎么了,00:38:30.500,00:38:32.860,"My goodness, what happened?"
00:38:32.680,00:38:35.350,姐姐小产后虽已痊愈,00:38:33.680,00:38:36.620,"Even though you have now recovered from your miscarriage,"
00:38:36.560,00:38:40.310,却总是体虚 我查阅古方,00:38:37.680,00:38:39.860,you have still been feeling weak.
,,,00:38:40.240,00:38:42.240,I consulted some ancient formulae
00:38:41.280,00:38:44.190,说是以人血入药最能滋补,00:38:42.460,00:38:45.460,"and they say that human blood can bring out
the nourishing elements of herbs."
00:38:45.920,00:38:47.230,所以才尽力一试,00:38:46.920,00:38:48.700,So I tried using my blood
00:38:48.720,00:38:50.630,希望姐姐可以身体强健,00:38:49.740,00:38:52.080,I hope that it can help improve your health
00:38:51.560,00:38:53.110,再为皇上生儿育女,00:38:52.500,00:38:54.120,and prepare you for another pregnancy.
00:38:53.320,00:38:55.780,你疯了 古方岂可当真,00:38:54.120,00:38:55.620,Were you out of your mind?
,,,00:38:55.760,00:38:57.420,You can't trust ancient formulae!
00:38:56.800,00:38:58.670,况且我也不是什么大病,00:38:57.780,00:38:59.640,I'm not even ill.
00:38:59.120,00:39:00.430,多吃些药膳就会好的,00:39:00.180,00:39:01.900,My health will recover with nourishing herbs.
00:39:00.840,00:39:03.550,我不管 我只要姐姐好好的,00:39:01.900,00:39:03.260,I don't care.
00:39:04.320,00:39:05.790,再能生下孩子便可,00:39:03.340,00:39:05.040,All I want is for you to be in good health
,,,00:39:05.380,00:39:07.280,and to be able to have another child.
00:39:08.760,00:39:11.270,自姐姐再度得皇上爱幸之后,00:39:09.840,00:39:12.460,"After you regained favor from His Majesty,"
00:39:12.360,00:39:15.030,我便觉出姐姐与我生分了不少,00:39:13.280,00:39:16.280,"I have been feeling distant from you, Sourire."
00:39:16.080,00:39:16.710,不知是因为,,,
00:39:17.040,00:39:18.630,我也得皇上宠爱的缘故,00:39:17.140,00:39:19.940,I don't know if that's because of His Majesty's favor for me
00:39:19.400,00:39:20.950,还是怪我那日在翊坤宫,,,
00:39:21.240,00:39:24.270,无能为力 没能救出姐姐,00:39:20.580,00:39:23.100,or my inability to prevent Consort Fleur
00:39:24.840,00:39:26.550,眼睁睁看着孩子没了,00:39:24.040,00:39:25.660,punishing you in her courtyard.
00:39:26.800,00:39:28.590,妹妹 你别瞎想,00:39:25.840,00:39:27.660,I could only watch as you lost your child.
,,,00:39:27.680,00:39:29.580,"Lingrong, don't dwell on it."
00:39:29.800,00:39:31.710,妹妹在宫中无依无靠,00:39:30.840,00:39:32.960,I have no one else to rely on in this palace
00:39:33.360,00:39:34.830,唯有姐姐跟皇上,00:39:34.500,00:39:36.420,other than you and His Majesty.
00:39:36.960,00:39:38.590,若因为皇上的宠爱,00:39:38.020,00:39:39.980,If you distanced yourself from me
00:39:39.160,00:39:40.380,而使姐姐生疏,00:39:40.100,00:39:42.180,"because of His Majesty's favor to me,"
00:39:41.560,00:39:43.230,妹妹宁愿只要姐姐,00:39:42.660,00:39:44.640,I would rather have you than His Majesty.
00:39:44.400,00:39:48.390,陵容 我不是这个意思 只是,00:39:45.400,00:39:47.760,"Lingrong, that's not what I meant."
00:39:48.680,00:39:52.550,姐姐 眉姐姐已经跟咱们生疏了,00:39:48.620,00:39:50.420,"- It's just ...
- Sourire."
,,,00:39:51.640,00:39:53.860,Meizhuang has already drifted apart from us.
00:39:53.600,00:39:55.630,难不成你也要跟我生分了吗,00:39:54.600,00:39:56.820,Will you also turn me away?
00:39:59.360,00:40:00.910,我们三人一同入宫,00:40:00.460,00:40:02.640,The three of us entered the palace together.
00:40:02.760,00:40:04.030,我虽比不上眉姐姐,,,
00:40:04.320,00:40:05.990,自幼跟你一起长大的情谊,00:40:03.700,00:40:07.180,"Although I didn't grow up with you as she did,"
00:40:07.000,00:40:09.510,可当时在甄府一同度过的日子,00:40:08.060,00:40:10.640,there's not a day I'm not grateful
00:40:10.840,00:40:12.350,妹妹没有一日忘怀,00:40:11.920,00:40:14.200,for the time your family took care of me.
00:40:13.520,00:40:17.030,是 就算你一心为我,00:40:14.520,00:40:15.640,"Yes,"
00:40:17.640,00:40:19.310,又何必要这样自残身体呢,00:40:16.680,00:40:18.480,"but even if you wanted to help me,"
00:40:19.640,00:40:21.630,因为姐姐是唯一肯帮我的人,00:40:18.560,00:40:20.460,why did you have to harm yourself?
,,,00:40:20.600,00:40:23.060,Because you are the only one who will help me!
00:40:22.680,00:40:24.350,若姐姐都不肯信我,00:40:23.700,00:40:25.660,"If you do not trust me,"
00:40:25.400,00:40:29.350,在这后宫之中 还有谁能信呢,00:40:26.420,00:40:28.320,who else can I trust
,,,00:40:29.100,00:40:30.700,in the harem?
00:40:31.560,00:40:35.790,是 红颜弹指老 未老恩先断,00:40:32.500,00:40:33.820,You're right.
00:40:36.920,00:40:38.190,到时候能陪我,00:40:34.300,00:40:37.420,"“Beauty withers in the snap of a finger.
But favor fades even before age.”"
00:40:38.520,00:40:40.310,斜倚熏笼坐到天明的,00:40:37.680,00:40:39.200,Only you and Meizhuang
00:40:41.200,00:40:42.550,也只有你和眉姐姐了,00:40:39.500,00:40:43.580,"will ""sit with me by the incense burner until dawn""
[from a poem about a concubine who lost favor]"
00:40:42.760,00:40:43.510,不会的,,,
00:40:44.240,00:40:45.380,姐姐不会失宠,00:40:43.720,00:40:44.880,"No, Sourire,"
00:40:46.760,00:40:48.390,我会一直与姐姐一起,00:40:45.300,00:40:47.040,you will never be out of favor.
00:40:49.120,00:40:50.030,陪着姐姐,00:40:47.860,00:40:49.860,I will always be by your side
,,,00:40:50.160,00:40:51.820,to keep you company.
00:40:52.120,00:40:54.150,好了 别伤心了,00:40:53.020,00:40:54.160,It's all right.
00:40:55.880,00:40:56.750,你若有心,00:40:54.160,00:40:55.520,Don't be sad.
00:40:57.560,00:40:59.350,就替我那孩子抄些经文吧,00:40:56.760,00:40:58.300,"If you have the heart to,"
,,,00:40:58.520,00:41:00.480,you can copy some sutras for my child.
00:41:00.320,00:41:01.460,也盼他早登极乐,00:41:01.320,00:41:02.820,I hope he will reach the Pure Land.
00:41:01.880,00:41:04.110,不用姐姐说 早抄了许多,00:41:02.860,00:41:05.360,You didn't need to ask. I have already copied some.
00:41:05.040,00:41:05.870,那就好,,,
00:41:07.320,00:41:08.870,这几日我总觉得乏力,00:41:06.060,00:41:07.500,I appreciate it.
00:41:10.240,00:41:11.300,不如你回去时,00:41:08.360,00:41:10.580,I've been feeling fatigued recently.
00:41:11.960,00:41:13.910,把我抄好的经文送去宝华殿,00:41:11.120,00:41:14.900,May I trouble you to bring my copies to the Baohua Hall
00:41:14.280,00:41:15.150,捎给那孩子,00:41:15.000,00:41:16.660,so they can send it to my child?
00:41:16.280,00:41:19.070,也算我这个做母亲的尽点心意,00:41:17.220,00:41:20.380,"It's all I can do for him, as his mother."
00:41:21.000,00:41:22.790,那姐姐把抄好的经文给我,00:41:22.000,00:41:23.980,"If you give your copies to me,"
00:41:23.160,00:41:23.990,我现在就去,00:41:24.060,00:41:25.420,I will go right away.
00:41:24.760,00:41:27.270,浣碧 你去取经文来,00:41:25.780,00:41:28.080,"Jade, bring the sutras"
00:41:27.560,00:41:28.700,陪安贵人去宝华殿吧,,,
00:41:29.080,00:41:29.670,是,00:41:28.420,00:41:29.960,and go with Lady An.
,,,00:41:30.160,00:41:31.000,Yes.
00:41:35.080,00:41:36.140,姐姐好生休息,00:41:35.920,00:41:37.660,"I will let you rest, Sourire."
00:41:37.000,00:41:38.060,妹妹即刻就去,00:41:38.020,00:41:39.400,I will take my leave now.
00:41:53.000,00:41:54.950,小主 这药喝吗,00:41:54.120,00:41:56.420,"My Lady, are you going to drink it?"
00:41:56.760,00:41:59.390,不是温太医开的药 我都不喝,00:41:57.780,00:42:00.660,I don't take any medicine that is not prescribed by Dr. Wen.
00:42:01.000,00:42:01.710,去倒了吧,00:42:01.840,00:42:03.040,Discard it.
00:42:03.280,00:42:05.790,安贵人对小主倒是有心,00:42:04.220,00:42:07.400,"Lady An cares for you from her heart, My Lady."
00:42:08.680,00:42:11.310,是否有心 不在这些东西上,00:42:09.560,00:42:12.300,Care does not reside in an object.
00:42:12.480,00:42:14.190,她是否真的割肉都不要紧,00:42:13.540,00:42:15.700,"Whether she cut herself or not,"
00:42:15.520,00:42:18.310,我只盼她还有些姐妹真心,00:42:16.480,00:42:19.320,I hope her heart harbors some sincerity.
