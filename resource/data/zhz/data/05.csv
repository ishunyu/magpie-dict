00:02:24.080,00:02:25.030,启禀小主子,00:02:25.520,00:02:26.836,"My Lady,"
00:02:26.160,00:02:28.390,奴才再也不能伺候小主了,00:02:27.235,00:02:30.000,I can no longer be in your service.
00:02:29.440,00:02:31.590,怎么了 有话好好说,00:02:30.642,00:02:33.163,What happened? Calm yourself down.
00:02:36.160,00:02:38.110,刚才内务府公公前来传话,,,
00:02:38.960,00:02:40.230,启祥宫丽嫔娘娘,00:02:37.244,00:02:40.022,The Household Department just came to deliver a message.
00:02:40.960,00:02:43.190,指名让奴才过去伺候,00:02:40.173,00:02:44.627,Concubine Beauté has specially requested me to work in her palace.
00:02:50.960,00:02:51.590,知道了,,,
00:02:53.200,00:02:54.750,丽嫔娘娘那儿也是个好去处,00:02:52.200,00:02:53.357,I see.
00:02:55.680,00:02:56.820,能去也是你的造化,00:02:54.200,00:02:58.378,It's not bad for you to serve Her Highness Concubine Beauté.
00:02:58.200,00:02:59.830,收拾了东西即刻就去吧,,,
00:03:00.320,00:03:01.110,多谢小主,00:02:59.488,00:03:01.343,You may pack and leave right away.
,,,00:03:01.343,00:03:02.848,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:03:03.960,00:03:05.100,奴才舍不得您,00:03:05.212,00:03:06.942,I really wish I could stay.
00:03:06.200,00:03:09.740,奴才走后 小主您要保重身子呀,00:03:07.341,00:03:11.207,"After I leave, please take care of your health."
00:03:18.280,00:03:18.950,浣碧,,,
00:03:20.880,00:03:21.990,把宫里的人都唤进来,00:03:19.618,00:03:20.698,"Jade,"
00:03:22.600,00:03:23.230,是,00:03:22.006,00:03:23.587,call everyone in.
,,,00:03:23.587,00:03:24.560,Yes.
00:03:40.960,00:03:43.550,我这一病 快两个月了,00:03:42.090,00:03:45.132,I have been sick for almost two months already.
00:03:46.080,00:03:47.110,病中怕吵闹,,,
00:03:48.720,00:03:50.350,也实在无需这么多人来伺候,00:03:47.200,00:03:51.811,"I prefer a quiet healing environment
and my palace is overstaffed for that."
00:03:51.800,00:03:53.510,所以今儿找你们来只问一句话,,,
00:03:54.760,00:03:56.350,若谁有意离开碎玉轩,00:03:53.000,00:03:55.760,I've summoned all of you to ask one question only:
00:03:57.440,00:03:59.430,去浣碧那里领一锭银子便可走人,00:03:55.949,00:04:00.987,"If anyone wishes to leave the Palace of Pearl Jade,
you may take a sycee from Jade and leave."
00:04:02.760,00:04:05.030,大家还不快恭喜康公公和印公公,,,
00:04:05.440,00:04:06.350,丽嫔那儿已经指名了,00:04:03.834,00:04:09.169,"We all should congratulate Mr. Kang and Mr. Yin
on their new positions with Concubine Beauté."
00:04:06.680,00:04:07.630,要他们去伺候,,,
00:04:08.080,00:04:09.670,待会儿收拾完东西就走,,,
00:04:10.000,00:04:11.510,小主素日待康公公不薄,00:04:09.320,00:04:11.220,They will pack and leave today.
00:04:11.960,00:04:13.870,康公公也巴儿狗似的殷勤得很,00:04:11.220,00:04:15.211,"My Lady has treated you kindly, Mr. Kang,
and you have been as loyal as a dog."
00:04:14.160,00:04:15.910,怎么如今攀了高枝说走就走,,,
00:04:16.240,00:04:17.750,连主仆情分都不顾了,00:04:15.400,00:04:19.161,"But when you see a higher branch to jump to,
you can forget about your mistress, can't you?"
00:04:18.680,00:04:20.350,流朱姑娘 您错怪我了,00:04:19.538,00:04:21.820,"Vermilion, you misunderstood."
00:04:21.280,00:04:23.030,奴才一心想伺候小主,,,
00:04:23.720,00:04:25.670,可丽嫔娘娘指名让我过去,00:04:22.490,00:04:27.131,"I only have the heart to serve My Lady,
but Concubine Beauté asked for me."
00:04:26.840,00:04:29.030,奴才我也是身不由己呀,00:04:27.999,00:04:30.560,I cannot be where my heart wants to be.
00:04:29.960,00:04:31.070,好个身不由己,,,
00:04:31.400,00:04:32.540,我竟不知这世上,00:04:31.060,00:04:32.574,Your heart?
00:04:32.880,00:04:34.590,还有牛不喝水强按头的道理,00:04:32.725,00:04:35.933,"I never knew that you could force a cow to drink
by pressing its head."
00:04:35.000,00:04:36.510,既然你一心想伺候小主,,,
00:04:36.800,00:04:39.150,那么这份忠心倒辜负不得,00:04:36.084,00:04:40.446,"Since you are devoted to serving My Lady,
your loyalty must not be compromised."
00:04:39.400,00:04:41.030,不如你去辞了丽嫔娘娘,,,
00:04:41.400,00:04:42.270,告诉丽嫔娘娘,,,
00:04:42.560,00:04:44.230,你是个一身不侍二主的忠仆,00:04:40.520,00:04:45.551,"Why don't you decline and tell Her Highness that
a loyal servant won't serve two masters?"
00:04:44.520,00:04:46.150,丽嫔娘娘自然不会怪你,,,
00:04:46.400,00:04:48.590,我呢 也立即向您斟茶认错,00:04:45.702,00:04:49.740,"I'm sure Concubine Beauté will understand.
And I will apologize to you over tea."
00:04:49.160,00:04:51.540,只怕是有人口不应心罢了,00:04:50.377,00:04:52.800,I'm afraid your mouth doesn't say what your heart wants to.
00:04:51.800,00:04:52.590,流朱,,,
00:04:53.240,00:04:54.590,康公公忠心大着呢,00:04:52.983,00:04:54.003,Vermilion.
00:04:54.920,00:04:56.060,伺候谁都是一样的,00:04:54.380,00:04:57.340,"Mr. Kang has great loyalty.
It doesn't matter who he serves."
00:04:57.160,00:04:58.350,浣碧给银子,00:04:58.480,00:05:00.000,"Jade, give him the sycee."
00:05:02.400,00:05:05.030,康公公 好走,00:05:03.735,00:05:06.611,"Farewell, Mr. Kang."
00:05:07.880,00:05:10.550,印公公你也拿好了,00:05:09.038,00:05:12.078,"And you too, Mr. Yin."
00:05:11.640,00:05:13.510,以后多学着你师傅的忠心,00:05:12.802,00:05:15.108,You must learn from your shifu's loyalty.
00:05:13.960,00:05:15.350,前程远大着呢,00:05:15.108,00:05:16.805,It goes a long way.
00:05:19.560,00:05:20.430,谢小主,00:05:20.720,00:05:22.334,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:05:29.960,00:05:30.830,要走的一起走了,,,
00:05:31.760,00:05:33.150,今日还有得银子给你们,00:05:31.000,00:05:32.796,Go with them if you wish!
00:05:33.440,00:05:34.500,若过了今日再想走,00:05:32.840,00:05:34.440,While you can still get the money.
00:05:34.960,00:05:36.310,小主立刻回了皇后,,,
00:05:36.600,00:05:37.660,拉去慎刑司做苦役,00:05:34.511,00:05:39.191,"If you make a request after today,
My Lady will send you to the Department of Penalty."
00:05:38.160,00:05:39.110,你们自己想清楚了,00:05:39.191,00:05:40.609,Don't think twice!
00:05:40.120,00:05:42.580,奴才愚笨 怕是伺候不好小主,00:05:41.062,00:05:44.009,"I'm afraid I am incompetent to serve you, My Lady."
00:05:55.360,00:05:57.920,奴婢愿跟随小主 绝无二心,00:05:56.520,00:05:59.660,"My Lady, I am willing to follow you without a second thought."
00:06:03.120,00:06:04.550,奴婢也跟随小主,00:06:04.489,00:06:06.287,"Me as well, My Lady."
00:06:10.040,00:06:11.260,奴才受常在恩惠,,,
00:06:11.720,00:06:12.860,决不敢背弃常在,00:06:11.211,00:06:12.909,"I am indebted to your favors, My Lady."
00:06:13.520,00:06:14.390,为何这样说,00:06:12.909,00:06:14.590,I'd never dare to betray you.
00:06:14.760,00:06:16.830,奴才的哥哥病在四执库没人理会,00:06:14.779,00:06:15.906,Why is that?
00:06:17.280,00:06:19.150,若不是小主在病中仍挂念着,,,
00:06:19.680,00:06:20.950,请了温大人去医治,00:06:15.906,00:06:23.317,"When my brother was desperately sick,
you sent Dr. Wen to treat him."
00:06:21.400,00:06:22.110,只怕,,,
00:06:23.240,00:06:24.630,只怕哥哥早就不成了,,,
00:06:25.600,00:06:27.470,奴才兄弟受小主这等大恩,00:06:24.332,00:06:26.638,"Without you, my brother wouldn't still be alive."
00:06:27.920,00:06:29.030,一定尽忠侍奉,00:06:26.940,00:06:30.400,"We owe you a great debt.
I will spare no effort in my service."
00:06:29.440,00:06:30.500,今生报不完的,,,
00:06:30.800,00:06:32.630,将来死了变个大青牛,00:06:30.480,00:06:32.725,"If I can't pay you back in this life,"
00:06:33.000,00:06:34.750,驮着小主成菩萨去,00:06:32.725,00:06:36.193,I will become a black ox that takes you to the Pure Land.
00:06:35.040,00:06:35.750,油嘴,,,
00:06:36.520,00:06:37.910,这都是奴才的真心话,00:06:36.193,00:06:37.397,Stop it.
00:06:38.320,00:06:39.380,绝不敢诳骗小主,00:06:37.548,00:06:40.652,"I mean every word I say.
I would never lie to My Lady."
00:06:40.120,00:06:40.950,行了行了,,,
00:06:41.720,00:06:43.430,回头把头再磕破了,00:06:41.120,00:06:42.797,Enough of the bows.
00:06:43.760,00:06:45.190,还得找温太医再来一次,00:06:43.061,00:06:46.822,"If you break your forehead,
I will have to ask Dr. Wen to help you again."
00:06:45.920,00:06:47.430,这外头人都已经说了,,,
00:06:47.920,00:06:49.060,说咱们碎玉轩的人,,,
00:06:49.400,00:06:50.830,一个个都病快快的,00:06:47.154,00:06:51.794,"I do not want the outsiders to keep saying that
everyone in my palace is weak and sick."
00:06:54.480,00:06:55.790,如今入冬了夜里凉,,,
00:06:56.400,00:06:58.510,小允子在廊上上夜总是受冻,00:06:55.617,00:06:59.845,"It's been cold at night.
Xiao-Yunzi is always freezing on guard."
00:06:59.080,00:07:00.590,给他备一条厚一点的被子,,,
00:07:01.160,00:07:01.830,是,00:07:00.184,00:07:02.193,Prepare a thicker blanket for him.
00:07:02.440,00:07:03.390,谢小主恩典,00:07:02.193,00:07:03.254,Yes.
00:07:10.520,00:07:11.630,你们跟着我,,,
00:07:11.880,00:07:13.390,这个久病失宠的小主,00:07:03.480,00:07:04.980,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:07:13.720,00:07:14.830,从没享过一天的福,00:07:11.849,00:07:15.989,"All of your days have not been easy,
following an unwell and neglected concubine."
00:07:15.400,00:07:16.510,却还如此待我,,,
00:07:18.480,00:07:19.390,我无以为报,00:07:16.593,00:07:18.704,But you still treat me well.
00:07:22.280,00:07:23.590,只要有我在一日,00:07:19.647,00:07:22.061,I don't know how I can repay your kindness.
00:07:25.080,00:07:26.390,我绝不让你们受委屈,00:07:23.460,00:07:27.680,"For as long as I live,
I won't let your days be difficult."
00:07:27.320,00:07:28.460,多谢小主多谢小主,00:07:28.551,00:07:30.000,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:07:35.680,00:07:37.030,内务府的人真是惫懒,,,
00:07:37.400,00:07:38.540,眼瞧着小主不得势,,,
00:07:38.880,00:07:40.230,连好一点的炭都不送来,00:07:37.240,00:07:41.520,"The Household Department is so dismissive.
Because of My Lady's status, they didn't send good charcoal."
00:07:40.440,00:07:41.310,小点声 你瞧瞧,00:07:41.580,00:07:42.783,Not so loud.
00:07:43.280,00:07:44.190,小主病着,,,
00:07:44.480,00:07:46.990,听了这些话又要难受,00:07:44.480,00:07:48.548,"My Lady is unwell.
She will feel worse if she hears it."
00:07:48.440,00:07:49.390,水烧好了吗,,,
00:07:49.600,00:07:50.350,好了,00:07:49.500,00:07:50.900,Is the water boiling?
,,,00:07:50.900,00:07:51.740,Yes.
00:07:50.720,00:07:53.670,这个炭怕是用不了了 烟太大,00:07:51.891,00:07:55.092,"This charcoal is smoky.
I'm afraid we can't use it indoors."
00:07:54.520,00:07:55.710,我去灌个汤婆子吧,,,
00:07:56.280,00:07:58.270,给小主放到铺里暖和些,00:07:55.506,00:07:59.460,I'll go fill a hot water bottle for My Lady to keep her bed warm.
00:07:58.640,00:07:59.310,你去吧,00:07:59.460,00:08:00.688,"Aye, go ahead."
00:08:02.840,00:08:04.710,二位小主吉祥 小主吉祥,00:08:03.920,00:08:05.541,Peace to My Ladies.
00:08:05.040,00:08:07.390,天真是冷了 你们小主倒好睡,00:08:05.767,00:08:09.040,"It's very cold these days,
the perfect weather for Attendant Sourire to sleep more."
00:08:08.240,00:08:09.990,沈贵人吉祥 安答应吉祥,00:08:09.455,00:08:11.640,Peace to Lady Shen and Companion An.
00:08:18.120,00:08:19.510,这屋里好冷,00:08:19.580,00:08:21.280,It's freezing in here.
00:08:20.800,00:08:22.710,怎么样 你好些了吗 眉姐姐,00:08:21.689,00:08:23.740,"- Are you feeling better?
- Meizhuang."
00:08:23.800,00:08:24.780,姐姐 妹妹,00:08:24.306,00:08:26.285,"- Sourire.
- Lingrong."
00:08:26.240,00:08:27.150,冰凉的手,,,
00:08:27.480,00:08:28.390,好些了吗,00:08:27.500,00:08:29.860,"- Your hands are cold.
- Have you been better?"
00:08:29.600,00:08:30.510,老样子吧,,,
00:08:31.320,00:08:32.870,老是这样可怎么行呢,00:08:30.874,00:08:32.400,Just the same.
00:08:35.480,00:08:37.430,姐姐这个玉钗颜色极好,00:08:32.626,00:08:34.389,You can't go on like this.
00:08:37.800,00:08:38.940,定是皇上赏的吧,00:08:36.700,00:08:40.280,"I like the color of your hairpin.
It must be a gift from His Majesty."
00:08:40.280,00:08:42.580,眉姐姐现在圣眷正浓呢,00:08:41.340,00:08:43.894,Meizhuang is in high favor now.
00:08:43.000,00:08:44.350,碎玉轩冷僻,,,
00:08:44.640,00:08:46.390,天凉了就更不宜养病了,00:08:44.271,00:08:47.780,"Your palace is secluded,
and the cold makes it even less suitable for recuperation."
00:08:46.800,00:08:48.510,我给你带了几篓银炭来,,,
00:08:48.800,00:08:49.830,你先对付着用吧,00:08:48.044,00:08:51.292,"I brought you several baskets of silver charcoal.
It should last for a while."
00:08:50.280,00:08:52.870,我见槿汐烧的炭盆都是用的黑炭,00:08:51.659,00:08:54.292,I saw Jinxi was burning dark charcoal.
00:08:53.400,00:08:55.550,定是内务府那帮奴才使坏,00:08:54.669,00:08:57.758,The Household Department must be giving you trouble.
00:08:56.600,00:08:58.430,我总要禀明了皇后才是,00:08:57.758,00:08:59.925,I have to report this to the Empress.
00:08:59.400,00:09:02.070,我久病失势 难免他们不周到些,00:09:00.665,00:09:03.405,Inconsideration is natural for a favorless concubine.
00:09:02.920,00:09:04.350,多一事不如少一事吧,00:09:03.949,00:09:06.110,Let's save ourselves from one more trouble.
00:09:05.560,00:09:06.590,况且你受宠,,,
00:09:06.960,00:09:08.510,他们也不敢十分怠慢我,00:09:06.820,00:09:10.020,"Because you're in favor, they don't dare neglect me too much."
00:09:09.160,00:09:11.750,再说你们不也给我送来了吗,00:09:10.375,00:09:13.149,"Besides, you two have already brought me some charcoal."
00:09:12.520,00:09:15.310,雪中送炭的情谊可比什么都可贵,00:09:13.540,00:09:16.971,"Nothing can compare to the kindness
of sending charcoal on a snowy day."
00:09:16.360,00:09:17.710,亏得你好性子,,,
00:09:18.080,00:09:20.110,连康禄海那样没心肝的东西走了,00:09:17.670,00:09:22.358,"It's because you have a tolerant mind.
You even put up with that heartless Kang Luhai."
00:09:20.440,00:09:21.310,你都能忍耐,,,
00:09:21.920,00:09:23.390,既是没心肝的东西,,,
00:09:23.920,00:09:25.140,不在眼前也清净,00:09:23.197,00:09:26.631,"When a heartless person is out of sight,
he's out of my mind."
00:09:26.440,00:09:27.830,你的意思是,00:09:27.620,00:09:29.276,What do you mean?
00:09:28.520,00:09:31.190,奴才不在于多只在于忠心与否,00:09:29.691,00:09:32.974,The loyalty of the servants outweighs the number.
00:09:33.480,00:09:36.390,是啊 看来回去我也得留心,00:09:34.709,00:09:38.038,"Indeed, I will be careful about mine as well."
00:09:37.280,00:09:38.390,陵容也是,,,
00:09:39.560,00:09:41.550,妹妹不懂得如何驾驭下人,00:09:38.500,00:09:40.160,"And you too, Lingrong."
00:09:41.840,00:09:42.980,多谢姐姐提醒,00:09:40.734,00:09:44.325,"Thank you for your reminder.
I will learn to manage my servants."
00:09:44.880,00:09:47.390,只是甄姐姐这病长久未愈,,,
00:09:47.840,00:09:48.590,想必,,,
00:09:48.840,00:09:51.070,也是因为病中太过操心的缘故,00:09:46.041,00:09:52.120,"Sourire is having a slow recovery
probably because of her troubled mind."
00:09:51.440,00:09:53.590,我还好你怎么样,00:09:52.459,00:09:55.299,I'm all right. What about you?
00:09:55.480,00:09:56.510,可曾侍寝了,,,
00:09:57.280,00:09:58.750,皇上哪里会记得我,00:09:56.560,00:09:58.340,Have you served His Majesty?
00:09:59.720,00:10:00.670,你别多心,00:09:58.491,00:10:00.411,Why would His Majesty even remember me?
00:10:01.000,00:10:02.470,西北战事吃紧,00:10:00.726,00:10:02.200,Don't overthink.
00:10:02.680,00:10:04.870,皇上一时顾不上后宫也是常有的,00:10:02.200,00:10:06.262,"With the warfare in the Northwest,
it's natural that His Majesty overlooks the harem."
00:10:05.240,00:10:07.150,你迟早会侍奉圣驾的,00:10:06.451,00:10:08.718,You will serve His Majesty sooner or later.
00:10:08.560,00:10:09.950,皇上忙 我知道,,,
00:10:10.360,00:10:13.150,听说皇上十来天都没进后宫了,00:10:09.720,00:10:14.500,"I understand. I heard that His Majesty
has not visited the harem for over ten days."
00:10:13.560,00:10:16.870,是啊 太后知道了又要念叨呢,00:10:14.689,00:10:18.100,"Yes, the Empress Dowager will be chattering if she finds out."
00:10:20.320,00:10:22.700,我知道天冷了 要抱暖炉子,,,
00:10:23.160,00:10:25.620,有了这个暖炉套子便不会烫着手,00:10:21.680,00:10:24.300,"In this weather, I know you'll be using hot water bottles."
00:10:25.920,00:10:27.550,就连夜给姐姐做了一个,00:10:24.489,00:10:28.748,"I made this cover overnight
so your hands wouldn't get burned."
00:10:30.040,00:10:32.870,这织花锦是刚进宫时,,,
00:10:33.160,00:10:34.550,每位新人各得一匹的,00:10:31.300,00:10:35.773,"This flower-patterned textile was our welcome gift
when entering the palace."
00:10:35.320,00:10:36.460,这么好的料子,,,
00:10:36.800,00:10:38.750,做个暖炉套子岂不可惜了,00:10:36.517,00:10:40.080,Isn't it a pity to have it made into a cover?
00:10:39.000,00:10:41.300,不可惜妹妹没有什么,00:10:40.160,00:10:41.496,Not at all.
00:10:41.600,00:10:43.310,拿得出手的东西送给姐姐,00:10:41.798,00:10:44.031,I don't have anything presentable.
00:10:43.600,00:10:44.660,姐姐喜欢就好,,,
00:10:45.000,00:10:45.630,喜欢,00:10:44.800,00:10:46.268,It's worthwhile if you like it.
00:10:47.240,00:10:48.270,快年下了,00:10:46.268,00:10:47.287,I do.
00:10:48.480,00:10:49.870,皇后让我到宫中看看,,,
00:10:50.200,00:10:52.660,各处装点得怎么样我得先走了,00:10:48.342,00:10:52.369,"The new year is near,
so the Empress sent me to check the decorations in the harem."
00:10:52.920,00:10:54.390,快去吧 路上小心,00:10:52.520,00:10:53.916,I have to go now.
00:10:55.680,00:10:57.510,那妹妹也改日再来看姐姐,00:10:53.916,00:10:55.976,"Of course, be careful when you walk."
00:10:58.440,00:11:00.190,你身子弱 天气凉,00:10:56.800,00:10:59.420,I will also leave and visit you another day.
00:11:00.480,00:11:02.510,就别出来走动了 免得冻着,00:10:59.615,00:11:03.680,"You may not be used to the cold.
Don't go outside if you don't have to."
00:11:02.840,00:11:05.470,没关系 我喜欢和姐姐们在一起,00:11:03.984,00:11:07.025,It's all right. I like spending time with you both.
00:11:07.080,00:11:09.110,槿汐 送两位小主出去,,,
00:11:09.520,00:11:10.310,是,00:11:08.254,00:11:10.654,"Jinxi, please walk them out."
00:11:10.600,00:11:11.660,那你好好养着啊,00:11:10.654,00:11:11.508,Yes.
,,,00:11:11.705,00:11:13.586,Take care and feel better soon.
00:11:18.560,00:11:19.950,小主该喝药了,00:11:20.000,00:11:21.800,"My Lady, it's time for your medicine."
00:11:27.800,00:11:29.190,这药可还要喝多久,00:11:29.081,00:11:30.992,How much longer do you have to take this?
00:11:30.240,00:11:32.700,毕竟是药三分毒 只怕伤身哪,00:11:31.482,00:11:34.520,"After all, any medicine can do some harm to your health."
00:11:33.440,00:11:34.190,这药,,,
00:11:34.520,00:11:36.510,只是不让我的病好得那么快罢了,,,
00:11:36.880,00:11:37.670,不碍事的,00:11:34.698,00:11:39.187,"This formula only slows down my recovery.
There's no need to worry."
00:11:39.640,00:11:40.670,没有人发现吧,00:11:40.840,00:11:42.459,Did anyone find out?
00:11:42.800,00:11:45.030,只有我和流朱 没有旁人知道,00:11:43.815,00:11:46.471,Just Vermilion and I. No one else knows.
00:11:46.200,00:11:47.150,只是小主,,,
00:11:47.360,00:11:49.310,为何连沈贵人和安答应也瞒着,00:11:47.483,00:11:50.707,But why would you even hide this from Lady Shen and Companion An?
00:11:51.200,00:11:52.910,正因我与她们情同姐妹,,,
00:11:53.320,00:11:54.270,才不能告诉,00:11:52.399,00:11:55.613,"I see them as my sisters.
That's why it's best they don't know."
00:11:55.000,00:11:56.270,凡事都有个万一,,,
00:11:56.800,00:11:57.990,万一他日事发,,,
00:11:58.520,00:11:59.710,也不至于连累她们,00:11:56.146,00:12:01.109,"There is a chance this may come to light one day.
If that happens, they won't be implicated."
00:12:06.640,00:12:09.750,难得采月姑娘过来,,,
00:12:10.160,00:12:11.190,姑娘快请坐,00:12:08.959,00:12:11.282,"Lunar, you never have to make the trip here."
00:12:11.600,00:12:12.990,还不快拿椅子来请姑娘坐,00:12:11.433,00:12:13.924,Please have a seat. Bring a chair quickly.
00:12:13.200,00:12:14.030,不坐了不坐了,,,
00:12:14.400,00:12:16.430,刚替贵人送东西去碎玉轩,00:12:13.924,00:12:15.256,It's all right.
00:12:16.760,00:12:18.430,顺道来领这个月的月例,00:12:15.520,00:12:19.780,"Lady Shen just had some items sent to Attendant Sourire.
So I stopped by for this month's stipend."
00:12:19.000,00:12:19.590,快去,,,
00:12:19.840,00:12:21.750,把沈贵人宫里的月例银子包好,00:12:20.313,00:12:23.355,Go pack the stipend for Lady Shen's palace.
00:12:22.200,00:12:23.260,请采月姑娘带走,,,
00:12:23.600,00:12:24.430,是,00:12:23.355,00:12:24.713,Lunar is waiting.
00:12:25.760,00:12:27.310,姑娘从碎玉轩来,00:12:24.713,00:12:26.329,Yes.
00:12:27.640,00:12:28.390,是啊,00:12:26.760,00:12:28.860,You came from the Palace of Pearl Jade?
00:12:28.720,00:12:31.590,我们小主同莞常在是自幼的交情,00:12:29.011,00:12:32.891,"Yes, Lady Shen and Attendant Sourire
have been friends since childhood."
00:12:32.080,00:12:33.140,莞常在病了,,,
00:12:33.440,00:12:34.870,我们小主挂心得很,00:12:33.184,00:12:36.200,"My Lady has been concerned
ever since Attendant Sourire fell sick."
00:12:35.120,00:12:37.750,莞常在病着该好好调养调养,00:12:36.260,00:12:39.212,I hope Attendant Sourire is being taken good care of.
00:12:38.320,00:12:39.380,这个自然,,,
00:12:39.640,00:12:41.470,病人嘛 本该多照顾着些,00:12:39.434,00:12:42.663,"Of course, we all care for someone when they're unwell."
00:12:42.200,00:12:43.830,碎玉轩缺东少西的,,,
00:12:44.240,00:12:46.700,幸亏我们小主平日挑好的送去了,00:12:43.195,00:12:45.497,Yet her palace is ill-equipped for the winter.
00:12:47.080,00:12:49.870,否则啊还不知道到什么田地呢,00:12:45.497,00:12:48.298,"Fortunately, My Lady has always been sending things to her."
00:12:50.840,00:12:52.870,这怎么好叫贵人操心呢,00:12:48.562,00:12:51.128,Who knows what would have happened otherwise?
00:12:53.120,00:12:54.870,这都是我们内务府人的疏漏,00:12:52.017,00:12:56.120,"How can we have troubled Lady Shen about this?
This is the negligence of our department."
00:12:55.120,00:12:57.420,回头 回头我就叫人补上,00:12:56.459,00:12:59.163,I will... I'll have things made right in no time.
00:12:58.600,00:13:00.350,公公打理内务府上下,,,
00:13:00.680,00:13:02.110,每天的事千头万绪,,,
00:13:02.560,00:13:04.670,肯定是下面的奴才大意了,00:12:59.734,00:13:06.540,"Thank you for taking your time.
It must be an omission of your staff."
00:13:07.520,00:13:11.110,颂芝姑姑 哪阵风把您给吹来了,00:13:08.000,00:13:12.414,"Aiyo, what wind carried you here, Madam Songzhi?"
00:13:11.880,00:13:12.750,少献殷勤,,,
00:13:13.200,00:13:14.630,这不是快过年了吗,00:13:12.995,00:13:14.300,Don't butter me up.
00:13:14.880,00:13:16.630,翊坤宫的金纸不够用了,00:13:14.300,00:13:17.780,"The New Year is approaching.
Our palace is short on gold wrapping paper."
00:13:16.880,00:13:18.990,我怕娘娘要包东西赏人用,,,
00:13:19.440,00:13:20.790,所以就过来拿些,00:13:17.931,00:13:22.060,"Her Highness may need to prepare gifts.
So I came to get some in advance."
00:13:21.040,00:13:22.390,姑姑不早说,00:13:22.060,00:13:23.825,You should have told me earlier.
00:13:22.720,00:13:25.590,翊坤宫的金纸是最早送过去的,,,
00:13:25.960,00:13:27.430,又足足多添了一倍,00:13:23.825,00:13:28.800,"We sent golden paper to your palace before anyone else's,
and doubled the amount for you."
00:13:27.920,00:13:31.150,方才皇后宫里又拿了一迭去,00:13:29.070,00:13:32.440,The Empress's palace just collected one stack.
00:13:31.520,00:13:33.900,剩下的还要分给各宫的小主,,,
00:13:34.280,00:13:35.830,怕均不出多的了,00:13:32.779,00:13:37.213,"I'm afraid we have to share the remaining gold paper

00:13:43.880,00:13:46.590,一向翊坤宫要东西没有不给的,00:13:45.078,00:13:47.699,"The requests from my palace
have never been turned down before."
00:13:46.840,00:13:48.950,既然缺 就先挪了有的用,,,
00:13:49.200,00:13:50.790,稍后补上不就是了,00:13:47.925,00:13:52.043,"Since you still have gold paper in store,
send it to my palace and replenish some later."
00:13:50.960,00:13:51.750,这,00:13:52.043,00:13:53.371,But...
00:13:54.520,00:13:56.550,有些人的小主位分低,,,

00:14:10.560,00:14:11.990,我怕是记错日子,00:14:09.567,00:14:10.725,Congratulations.
00:14:12.600,00:14:14.350,还以为沈贵人在受罚,00:14:11.818,00:14:13.924,Perhaps I misremembered the date.
00:14:14.640,00:14:15.990,没得领月例呢,00:14:13.924,00:14:17.110,I thought Lady Shen was still forfeiting her stipend.
00:14:25.000,00:14:27.560,黄规全我可是告诉你了,00:14:26.122,00:14:28.774,"Huang Guiquan, I've said what I said."
00:14:28.240,00:14:29.910,到时候要是没有,,,
00:14:30.680,00:14:31.820,别怪娘娘生气,00:14:29.440,00:14:33.600,"If we run out, don't blame Her Highness for her temper."
00:14:38.000,00:14:40.230,这叫什么事啊,00:14:39.040,00:14:41.658,"Aiyo, what a job it is."
00:14:58.280,00:14:59.340,可冻坏人了,,,
00:14:59.680,00:15:00.430,年赏下来了吗,00:14:59.243,00:15:01.800,"- I'm frozen to the bone.
- Did you get everyone's year-end rewards?"
00:15:00.840,00:15:01.550,都下来了,,,
00:15:02.360,00:15:04.550,总算内务府顾着沈贵人的面子,00:15:01.800,00:15:03.216,Yes.
00:15:05.080,00:15:05.910,一点都没少,00:15:03.482,00:15:07.483,"All thanks  to Noble Lady Shen,
the Household Department gave us the amount in full."
00:15:07.320,00:15:08.710,幸亏有了沈贵人,,,
00:15:09.520,00:15:11.510,方才沈贵人派了人来,00:15:08.540,00:15:10.573,It's fortunate we have Lady Shen.
00:15:11.760,00:15:12.710,还送了好些东西呢,00:15:10.573,00:15:13.902,She also just had a lot more gifts sent here.
00:15:13.040,00:15:13.750,是吗,,,
00:15:14.080,00:15:15.590,这下可以好好过个年了,00:15:14.091,00:15:15.023,Did she?

00:15:16.960,00:15:18.790,今儿都二十五了吧,00:15:18.056,00:15:20.000,Isn't today the 25th already?
00:15:20.120,00:15:21.710,也不知小主子的病能不能好,00:15:21.040,00:15:23.466,I wonder if My Lady can get well enough
00:15:22.800,00:15:24.790,可别误了除夕晚上的合宫夜宴啊,00:15:23.680,00:15:26.240,to attend the imperial banquet on New Year's Eve.
00:15:25.040,00:15:28.390,没事 方才江福海过来传了懿旨,00:15:26.320,00:15:27.405,Don't worry.
00:15:29.080,00:15:30.790,说是小主病着,00:15:27.405,00:15:30.000,Jiang Fuhai just came to announce the Empress's edict
00:15:31.360,00:15:33.470,皇后恩准留宫休养,00:15:30.240,00:15:33.760,that My Lady is allowed to rest in her palace.
00:15:34.240,00:15:35.790,除夕夜不必去了,00:15:33.760,00:15:36.967,She doesn't need to attend the banquet on New Year's Eve.
00:15:36.240,00:15:37.110,这多好啊,,,
00:15:37.440,00:15:38.420,咱们一同守岁,,,

00:16:05.600,00:16:07.110,多谢皇上,00:16:05.507,00:16:06.501,Have a seat.
00:16:08.440,00:16:09.910,皇兄每回都说不必拘束,00:16:06.765,00:16:08.607,I thank Your Majesty.
00:16:10.320,00:16:12.990,可是按照规矩来呀 还是拘束,00:16:09.398,00:16:11.549,"Imperial brother, you always tell us to ignore the rules."
00:16:13.400,00:16:15.780,这话也就十七弟会说,00:16:11.549,00:16:14.224,"(Yunli, Noble Prince Guo)
But no one listens or ever forgets the rules."
00:16:16.080,00:16:17.060,他最怕拘束,00:16:14.601,00:16:18.522,"Only my seventeenth brother would say that.
He never stands on ceremony."
00:16:18.360,00:16:20.740,今儿不逃席 不迟到,00:16:19.640,00:16:22.427,He's not absent or even late today.
00:16:21.240,00:16:22.510,已经是很难得了,00:16:22.427,00:16:23.940,That is a surprise.
00:16:24.840,00:16:27.350,今夜团聚守岁 臣弟怎么能迟到,00:16:25.940,00:16:28.828,How can I be late for the New Year reunion?

00:21:10.360,00:21:11.310,真的 你别胡说,,,
00:21:11.600,00:21:12.630,小允子 别小气,00:21:10.794,00:21:12.481,"- Really?
- Don't... talk nonsense."
00:21:12.960,00:21:13.630,拿给我瞧瞧,00:21:12.481,00:21:14.840,"Xiao-Yunzi, don't be shy.
Let me see it."
00:21:13.920,00:21:15.190,快拿出来看看 拿出来看看,00:21:14.840,00:21:16.380,Let us see.
00:21:23.000,00:21:24.270,太像了 太像了,00:21:23.870,00:21:25.320,It looks just like you.
00:21:24.520,00:21:26.630,小允子你手好巧啊,00:21:25.320,00:21:27.893,"Xiao-Yunzi, you have gifted hands."
00:21:26.840,00:21:27.510,是啊,,,
00:21:27.760,00:21:28.350,奴才手拙,00:21:27.893,00:21:28.808,He does.
00:21:28.680,00:21:29.790,剪不出小主的花容月貌,,,
00:21:30.120,00:21:31.710,下次剪个更好的再给小主,00:21:28.808,00:21:32.780,"Not at all, it doesn't do justice to your beautiful face.
I'll make a better one next time."
00:21:32.240,00:21:33.270,是很像小主,,,
00:21:33.720,00:21:35.390,不过光看这眉眼,00:21:33.357,00:21:34.956,It does resemble My Lady a lot.
00:21:35.920,00:21:37.750,倒 倒有点像浣碧,00:21:34.956,00:21:36.960,"But on the eyes and brows,"
00:21:40.120,00:21:41.710,我哪里能跟小主比呀,00:21:37.727,00:21:39.488,it also looks like Jade.
00:21:42.040,00:21:42.870,让我看看,00:21:41.116,00:21:42.920,How can I compare to My Lady?
00:21:44.520,00:21:46.070,浣碧跟我时间久了,00:21:43.160,00:21:44.420,Come here.
00:21:46.440,00:21:47.500,还真挺像的,00:21:45.820,00:21:48.720,Jade does look like me after living together all these years.
00:21:48.640,00:21:50.230,那我怎么半点不像小主,,,
00:21:50.760,00:21:51.870,若人人都一模一样,00:21:50.000,00:21:51.849,But why don't I look like you?
00:21:52.160,00:21:53.070,可不要吓人了,00:21:52.038,00:21:54.440,Wouldn't it be scary if everyone looked the same?
00:21:54.520,00:21:55.870,不过你那贪玩的性子,,,
00:21:56.280,00:21:57.420,倒和我挺像的,00:21:55.670,00:21:59.010,But you take after my playful nature.
00:21:58.920,00:22:01.150,我听说 宫中有这样的习俗,00:21:59.720,00:22:02.620,I heard about this tradition in the palace.
00:22:01.640,00:22:02.550,在除夕之夜,,,
00:22:02.840,00:22:05.110,若是把心爱的东西挂到树枝上,,,
00:22:05.480,00:22:06.510,而且挂得越高越好,00:22:02.760,00:22:08.820,"On New Year's Eve, you can make a wish by hanging
your favorite thing on a tree. The taller the better!"
00:22:06.840,00:22:07.750,便可以祈福,,,
00:22:08.240,00:22:09.630,小主若是喜欢这个小像,,,
00:22:10.000,00:22:12.270,不妨就把它挂到院子的树枝上,00:22:09.308,00:22:13.695,"My Lady, if you like this portrait,
why not put it onto a tall tree in the yard?"
00:22:12.720,00:22:14.990,这样可以祈求来年事事如意,00:22:13.884,00:22:16.320,You can hope for good fortunes in the coming year.
00:22:15.520,00:22:17.270,这也是小允子的福气嘛,,,
00:22:17.520,00:22:18.310,好主意,00:22:16.800,00:22:18.492,It will also be a blessing for Xiao-Yunzi.
00:22:19.720,00:22:22.710,不过我看这院子里都是枯树枝,00:22:18.492,00:22:19.561,Good idea.
00:22:23.080,00:22:24.110,没什么可挂的,00:22:21.268,00:22:25.893,But there are only bare branches in our yard.
00:22:25.680,00:22:27.230,不如我们找个有梅花的地方,,,
00:22:27.640,00:22:28.430,把小像挂上去,00:22:26.808,00:22:29.689,How about we put the portrait on some blooming plum trees?
00:22:28.720,00:22:29.390,好啊,,,
00:22:29.600,00:22:30.580,倚梅园的梅花就好,00:22:29.689,00:22:30.689,Wonderful!
00:22:30.960,00:22:31.710,离咱们这儿还近,00:22:30.689,00:22:32.960,"The Garden of Leaning Plums is a good place, and close to us."
00:22:32.120,00:22:32.910,是白梅吗,,,
00:22:33.200,00:22:34.260,是玉蕊檀心梅,00:22:33.000,00:22:34.180,Are the flowers white in color?
00:22:34.520,00:22:36.150,开得像红云似的 好看极了,00:22:34.180,00:22:37.360,"No, they are pink with a jade-white center.
They look like beautiful rosy clouds."
00:22:37.360,00:22:38.070,不错,00:22:38.080,00:22:39.254,Lovely.
00:22:39.000,00:22:41.910,雪花映着红梅簇簇,,,
00:22:42.360,00:22:43.500,暗香浮动,00:22:40.186,00:22:44.996,"Clouds of red plum against the white snow,
and a floating fragrance."
00:22:44.160,00:22:45.950,这才算是良辰美景吧,00:22:45.260,00:22:47.318,What a beautiful scene for a memorable night.
00:22:46.680,00:22:47.390,我去看看,,,
00:22:48.200,00:22:49.550,小主 小主 去不得,00:22:47.808,00:22:49.208,I've got to see it!
00:22:49.840,00:22:50.820,小主身子尚未大好,00:22:49.220,00:22:51.040,"My Lady, don't go."
00:22:51.160,00:22:51.830,不能外出走动,,,
00:22:52.120,00:22:53.150,况且皇后盼咐下来说,00:22:51.086,00:22:53.015,"My Lady, you shouldn't go out due to your health."
00:22:53.440,00:22:55.550,小主身感时疾 不宜外出走动,00:22:53.206,00:22:56.711,"And the Empress instructed that
your condition might spread to others."
00:22:55.960,00:22:58.110,若是传到皇后耳中 怕要怪罪的,00:22:57.066,00:22:59.400,We will be held responsible if Her Majesty finds out.
00:22:58.320,00:22:59.150,是啊,,,
00:23:00.360,00:23:01.580,这夜深人静的,00:22:59.400,00:23:00.520,Indeed.
00:23:02.240,00:23:03.670,大家都在侍宴呢,00:23:01.394,00:23:04.678,Everyone is at the banquet at this time.
00:23:05.000,00:23:06.670,我一会儿穿着斗篷出去,,,
00:23:07.000,00:23:08.140,既暖和又不显眼,00:23:06.223,00:23:09.449,I will wear a cloak to keep myself warm and inconspicuous.
00:23:09.080,00:23:10.670,何况我都病了那么久了,,,
00:23:11.080,00:23:12.350,也该出去散散心了,00:23:10.204,00:23:13.796,"Besides, I've been staying in for so long.
I should go out for a walk."
00:23:13.000,00:23:13.590,小主 小主,,,
00:23:13.800,00:23:14.670,谁都不许跟着,00:23:13.800,00:23:14.790,My Lady...
00:23:15.280,00:23:16.070,我一个人去,00:23:14.790,00:23:16.036,Do not follow me!
00:23:16.920,00:23:18.230,谁要还敢拦着,00:23:16.513,00:23:17.760,I'll go alone.
,,,00:23:18.139,00:23:20.161,Whoever stops me
00:23:19.600,00:23:22.510,我就罚他在雪地里守岁一晚,00:23:20.689,00:23:24.040,will be standing on guard outside for the rest of tonight.
00:23:24.040,00:23:24.830,小主,00:23:25.160,00:23:26.140,My Lady...
00:23:51.680,00:23:52.630,五哥 请,,,
00:23:53.000,00:23:53.750,好好,,,
00:23:54.760,00:23:55.710,平安,00:23:53.569,00:23:55.198,Fifth Brother.
00:23:56.360,00:23:57.630,事事顺心 同乐,00:23:55.915,00:23:58.514,"- I wish you peace and happiness.
- You too."
00:24:21.640,00:24:23.830,宫中的梅花可开了吗,00:24:22.765,00:24:25.023,Are the plum trees flowering in the palace?
00:24:26.040,00:24:27.230,凌霜而开,,,
00:24:28.200,00:24:29.180,朕想去看看,00:24:26.980,00:24:29.184,Plum blossoms rising over the frost and snow.
00:24:30.000,00:24:31.060,天寒地冻的,00:24:29.448,00:24:30.890,I want to go take a look.
00:24:31.360,00:24:32.830,皇上还是保重龙体吧,00:24:31.159,00:24:33.826,"It's freezing cold outside.
Your Majesty should care for your health."
00:24:33.080,00:24:35.670,凌霜而开 怎可辜负,00:24:34.128,00:24:37.049,"They're rising over the frost and snow.
How can I leave them unnoticed?"
00:24:36.480,00:24:37.460,不必多言了,00:24:37.699,00:24:39.137,Say no more.
00:24:39.680,00:24:40.430,苏培盛,,,
00:24:41.120,00:24:41.950,皇上,00:24:40.858,00:24:42.160,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:24:42.300,00:24:43.380,Your Majesty.
00:24:42.880,00:24:45.910,不许人跟着 朕想一个人走走,00:24:43.957,00:24:47.480,"No one is allowed to follow.
I'll take a walk by myself"
00:24:47.080,00:24:48.110,醒醒酒,00:24:48.580,00:24:49.800,to sober up.
00:24:50.880,00:24:52.270,可是皇上 皇上,00:24:52.000,00:24:53.380,"- But Your Majesty...
- Your Majesty..."
00:24:53.000,00:24:54.870,不必多言 皇上,00:24:53.870,00:24:55.240,I'll be fine.
00:24:55.200,00:24:56.830,皇上这是去哪儿啊,00:24:55.240,00:24:56.300,Your Majesty.
,,,00:24:56.320,00:24:58.160,Where is Your Majesty going?
00:25:06.640,00:25:09.070,皇后娘娘 您看这怎么好啊,00:25:07.667,00:25:10.258,"Your Majesty, what shall we do now?"
00:25:09.360,00:25:11.030,外头天黑路滑的,00:25:10.669,00:25:12.640,It's dark and slippery outside.

00:25:24.040,00:25:25.350,不能没有人跟着,00:25:21.871,00:25:26.694,"His Majesty insisted on going by himself,
but he has to be taken care of on such an icy night."
00:25:28.400,00:25:29.950,今天怎么把红梅摆上来了,,,
00:25:30.800,00:25:31.780,华妃不知情,00:25:29.561,00:25:31.621,Why are there red plum flowers today?
00:25:32.760,00:25:35.220,宫宴的布置是华妃安排的,00:25:32.109,00:25:36.330,"Consort Fleur arranged the banquet decorations.
She doesn't know."
00:25:36.600,00:25:38.270,皇后放心臣弟去看看,00:25:37.640,00:25:40.000,"Your Majesty need not worry.
I'll follow His Majesty."
00:25:58.160,00:25:59.220,什么破差事啊,,,
00:25:59.760,00:26:00.550,大过年的,,,
00:26:00.840,00:26:02.230,偏剩我一个人在这儿受冻,00:25:59.228,00:26:03.371,"(Yu Ying'er)
Why do I have to do this in the cold on New Year's Eve?"

00:26:04.400,00:26:05.790,不就是欺负我是新来的吗,00:26:03.824,00:26:05.403,Just because I'm new to the palace!
,,,00:26:05.403,00:26:07.315,Asking me to cut flowers for the gods...

00:27:42.240,00:27:43.550,宫中争斗不断,,,
00:27:44.240,00:27:46.110,要保全自身实属不易,00:27:43.414,00:27:47.763,I understand it is difficult to stay outside the incessant rivalries.
00:27:48.360,00:27:52.670,愿逆风如解意 容易莫摧残,00:27:49.583,00:27:54.891,"“If the northern wind can hear the plum flowers,
spare the blooming wishes for a peaceful spring."""

00:28:05.240,00:28:06.070,再不说话,,,
00:28:06.400,00:28:08.310,便让人把整个倚梅园翻过来,00:28:06.460,00:28:09.561,Answer me or I'll have the entire garden searched!
00:28:12.280,00:28:14.630,奴婢倚梅园的宫女,00:28:13.242,00:28:16.028,I am a maid working in the garden.

00:28:21.640,00:28:23.990,奴婢贱名 恐污了尊耳,00:28:22.680,00:28:25.550,I'm afraid my humble name would tarnish your ears.
00:28:28.920,00:28:29.830,别过来,00:28:30.000,00:28:31.377,Don't come over!

00:29:35.280,00:29:37.150,华妃折了许多梅花插瓶,,,
00:29:37.520,00:29:38.390,她不是有意的,00:29:36.560,00:29:38.602,Consort Fleur decorated the banquet with plum flowers.
00:29:39.960,00:29:41.230,是朕有心,00:29:38.755,00:29:40.153,It wasn't intentional.
,,,00:29:41.247,00:29:42.784,I was sentimental.
00:29:42.680,00:29:45.670,华妃进王府晚 她什么都不知道,00:29:43.738,00:29:47.443,"She married into my estate later.
She knows nothing."
00:29:46.720,00:29:48.910,这么些年了 皇兄还放不下吗,00:29:47.745,00:29:50.662,"It's been years, and Your Majesty still cannot let go?"
00:29:51.560,00:29:52.870,朕放不下什么,00:29:52.594,00:29:54.560,Can't let go of what?
00:29:56.920,00:30:00.870,朕现在就等着开春后天气暖了,00:29:58.380,00:30:02.437,I'm looking forward to the warm spring weather.
00:30:02.120,00:30:04.790,你来陪朕说说话 下下棋,00:30:03.200,00:30:06.400,You can come here to talk and play Go with me.
00:30:05.800,00:30:07.910,皇兄之意正中臣弟下怀,00:30:06.954,00:30:09.314,Your Majesty's wish is mine as well.
00:30:08.880,00:30:11.910,不过此时臣弟闻得梅香醉人,,,
00:30:12.280,00:30:13.230,想喝杯酒了,00:30:10.201,00:30:14.615,"But for now, I desire a cup of wine
after smelling the inebriating blossoms."
00:30:13.520,00:30:16.310,这等美事 朕与你同去,00:30:14.841,00:30:17.826,I'll fulfill this delightful wish with you.
00:30:17.600,00:30:19.900,踏雪寻梅 尽兴而归,00:30:18.685,00:30:21.094,"Seeking plums in the snow
and returning with delighted hearts."
00:30:20.280,00:30:21.150,当痛饮三杯,,,
00:30:21.480,00:30:22.510,还有一桩美事,00:30:21.094,00:30:22.678,That deserves three hearty toasts.
00:30:23.720,00:30:26.830,朕没有想到宫女里也有才学之辈,00:30:22.678,00:30:24.719,There was another pleasure.
00:30:27.240,00:30:29.230,也算是意外之喜了,00:30:25.029,00:30:27.924,I didn't expect to come across a talented maid.
00:30:29.480,00:30:30.350,那恭喜皇兄了,00:30:28.489,00:30:30.520,What a nice surprise.
00:30:35.680,00:30:36.510,回来了 小主,00:30:30.520,00:30:32.135,"Congratulations, Imperial Brother."
00:30:37.560,00:30:38.590,小主回来了,00:30:37.067,00:30:38.580,"You're back, My Lady."
00:30:43.560,00:30:44.510,怎么了 小主,00:30:38.769,00:30:40.080,My Lady.
00:30:45.320,00:30:47.070,来 小主 先喝杯茶,00:30:44.773,00:30:46.229,What is wrong?
,,,00:30:46.407,00:30:48.540,Have some tea to warm up.
00:30:50.240,00:30:51.070,可是冻坏了,00:30:51.496,00:30:52.956,Are you numb from the cold?
00:30:54.200,00:30:54.950,怎么了,00:30:55.301,00:30:56.660,What happened?
00:31:00.480,00:31:02.470,刚有两只猫向我扑过来,00:31:01.630,00:31:03.983,I came across two cats jumping at me.
00:31:03.080,00:31:03.950,把我吓坏了,,,
00:31:05.040,00:31:06.230,小主自小怕猫,00:31:04.249,00:31:05.636,They scared me.
00:31:06.480,00:31:08.310,一下遇到两只 可不吓着了,00:31:06.134,00:31:10.000,"My Lady has always been afraid of cats.
It must have been frightening to see two at once."
00:31:09.080,00:31:10.550,我去熬一剂浓浓的姜汤,,,
00:31:10.920,00:31:12.270,给小主祛风压惊,00:31:10.641,00:31:14.181,"I'll make strong ginger soup
to dispel the cold and calm your nerves."
00:31:15.560,00:31:18.470,小主 这宫中素来有人爱养猫,00:31:16.745,00:31:19.576,"My Lady, many people like to keep cats in the palace."
00:31:19.000,00:31:20.270,猫的性子又野,00:31:20.246,00:31:21.724,They have an untamed nature.
00:31:20.560,00:31:23.150,您若怕猫 今后可得小心些为好,00:31:21.724,00:31:24.224,You need to be more careful in the future.
00:31:24.280,00:31:25.910,小主 可许了愿了,00:31:25.640,00:31:27.378,Did you make a wish?
00:31:27.880,00:31:28.790,许了,,,
00:31:29.440,00:31:31.150,天太冷 我就回来了,00:31:29.000,00:31:30.269,I did.
00:31:35.440,00:31:37.230,怎么寻到这里来了,00:31:30.720,00:31:32.800,But it was too cold. I came back quickly.
00:31:37.880,00:31:38.750,奴才该死,00:31:36.648,00:31:38.534,Why did you find your way here?
00:31:40.160,00:31:42.510,皇上就是赐死 奴才也不放心,00:31:39.064,00:31:40.726,"Please forgive me, Your Majesty."
00:31:42.920,00:31:44.510,皇上身边没人跟着,00:31:41.525,00:31:45.760,"But I couldn't put my mind at ease
while no one was accompanying Your Majesty."
00:31:44.920,00:31:47.350,所以就悄悄地跟着果郡王来了,00:31:46.180,00:31:48.460,So I followed Noble Prince Guo quietly.
00:31:47.800,00:31:49.950,你竟没发觉黄雀在后,00:31:48.909,00:31:51.567,“The mantis catches the cicada while a siskin follows.”
00:31:50.760,00:31:53.320,臣弟一心在皇兄身上 疏忽了,00:31:51.866,00:31:54.360,"I only had my eyes on Your Majesty.
It was my fault."
00:31:53.840,00:31:57.030,既然来了 朕就交给你个差事,00:31:55.039,00:31:58.400,"Since you are here, I have a task for you."
00:31:57.360,00:31:59.590,倚梅园有个有才学的宫女,,,
00:31:59.840,00:32:00.980,你去给朕找出来,00:31:58.633,00:32:02.020,"I need you to look for a knowledgeable maid
in the Garden of Leaning Plums."
00:32:01.280,00:32:04.070,办好了 朕就当你将功折罪,00:32:02.419,00:32:05.326,That will make up for your mistake.
00:32:04.600,00:32:05.510,奴才遵旨,00:32:05.880,00:32:07.108,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:32:06.960,00:32:09.830,但是奴才愚笨 请皇上指点,00:32:08.133,00:32:11.315,But I hope Your Majesty can enlighten my dull mind
00:32:10.080,00:32:12.590,该如何去考究这宫女的才学呢,00:32:11.315,00:32:13.804,how to test the knowledge of the maid.
00:32:12.880,00:32:15.030,你且问她逆风如解意,,,
00:32:15.360,00:32:16.310,下句是什么,00:32:14.031,00:32:18.225,"Ask her what is the next line for
""If the northern wind can hear the plum flowers."""
00:32:19.120,00:32:19.790,嗻,00:32:20.425,00:32:21.445,Aye.
00:32:26.280,00:32:28.660,刚才还说打马吊提神守岁呢,,,
00:32:28.920,00:32:31.030,结果呢 一个个都犯困了,00:32:27.300,00:32:32.380,"They hoped the game of Madiao cards would keep them awake,
but everyone is dozing off now."
00:32:34.480,00:32:36.510,也是我自己撑不住想睡了,00:32:35.761,00:32:37.804,I am sleepy as well.
00:32:38.080,00:32:40.310,今天小主手气好 赢了好几把,,,
00:32:40.600,00:32:42.430,也该叫咱们存点压岁钱,00:32:39.221,00:32:43.580,"My Lady, your luck was incredible today.
Now we don't have any lucky money for the new year."
00:32:42.760,00:32:44.030,还不是你们让着我,00:32:43.891,00:32:45.682,It was only because you all went easy on me.
00:32:46.400,00:32:49.910,我刚入宫 不太懂衣料纹样的事,00:32:47.624,00:32:51.451,I don't know much about fabric patterns in the palace.
00:32:50.760,00:32:53.550,我想问问你 团龙密纹,00:32:52.141,00:32:55.068,I wanted to ask you about dragon roundels.
00:32:54.240,00:32:55.220,什么样的人,,,
00:32:55.600,00:32:57.190,才能用团龙密纹的花样,00:32:55.558,00:32:58.616,Who can wear this pattern in the palace?
00:32:57.600,00:32:59.150,小主怎么想起问这个,00:32:58.842,00:33:00.498,"Why do you ask, My Lady?"
00:32:59.480,00:33:02.190,今日宫宴 不是遍请王公贵戚吗,00:33:00.875,00:33:03.742,I was just wondering what people would wear for the banquet.
00:33:03.840,00:33:05.390,原来小主想到这个,00:33:05.117,00:33:06.678,"I see, My Lady."
00:33:06.520,00:33:08.820,团龙密纹乃上用的图纹,00:33:07.655,00:33:10.177,The dragon roundels are not for normal princes.
00:33:09.240,00:33:10.670,等闲亲王也不可用,,,
00:33:11.320,00:33:13.550,非得是皇上看重的兄弟才可以,00:33:10.516,00:33:14.481,"They are exclusively used by the Emperor
and his most esteemed brothers."
00:33:16.440,00:33:18.110,先帝爷子孙昌茂,,,
00:33:19.200,00:33:20.750,能与皇上同饮夜宴的,00:33:17.780,00:33:23.018,"Of the prior emperor's many princes,
who could be invited to the New Year banquet?"
00:33:21.120,00:33:21.950,是哪几位王爷,,,
00:33:22.160,00:33:22.950,五爷 十爷,00:33:23.282,00:33:24.880,Lord V and Lord X.
00:33:25.080,00:33:26.270,还有十七爷,00:33:26.125,00:33:27.660,And Lord XVII.
00:33:27.480,00:33:29.470,他虽然和皇上不是一母所生,,,
00:33:30.040,00:33:32.070,但是从小是由太后抚养大的,00:33:28.725,00:33:30.985,"He is a half-brother of His Majesty,"
00:33:32.400,00:33:33.750,所以和皇上很亲近,00:33:31.340,00:33:33.702,but they both were brought up by the Empress Dowager.
00:33:34.680,00:33:36.510,未进宫前我也有所耳闻,00:33:33.702,00:33:35.212,They are very close.
,,,00:33:36.000,00:33:38.421,I've heard of Lord XVII before entering the palace.
00:33:37.360,00:33:41.470,十七爷闲云野鹤 精于六艺,00:33:38.760,00:33:43.020,"He's proficient in the Six Arts and lives ""as free as a wild crane""."
00:33:42.720,00:33:44.310,笛声更是京中一绝,,,
00:33:45.880,00:33:47.230,先帝在世的时候,00:33:43.875,00:33:46.515,His flute playing is unrivaled in the capital.
00:33:47.720,00:33:50.100,九王夺嫡之事何等的惨烈,00:33:47.040,00:33:51.302,Nine of the princes fought ruthlessly for the throne.
00:33:51.320,00:33:54.550,唯有十七爷整日与诗书为伴,,,
00:33:54.920,00:33:56.830,倒成全了他的福气尊贵,00:33:52.504,00:33:58.033,"Lord XVII found pleasure in solitude
and that granted him a distinguished life."
00:33:57.440,00:33:58.660,你这话倒也极是,00:33:58.610,00:34:00.177,That is true.
00:33:59.720,00:34:01.950,有时候不争,,,
00:34:02.480,00:34:04.590,比能争会争之人有福多了,00:34:00.879,00:34:05.960,Those who fight are not always as blessed as those who don't.
00:34:05.080,00:34:06.990,所以小主也是有福之人哪,00:34:06.182,00:34:08.380,"That's why you are a blessed one, My Lady."
00:34:07.880,00:34:08.590,但愿如此,,,
00:34:09.200,00:34:10.790,时候不早了 快睡吧,00:34:08.960,00:34:10.480,I surely hope so.
,,,00:34:10.480,00:34:12.340,"It's late. Sleep well, My Lady."
00:34:16.920,00:34:20.590,皇上有旨 今年节下宫中同庆,00:34:18.140,00:34:21.965,"Per His Majesty's decree, the whole palace
will celebrate the New Year together."
00:34:21.240,00:34:22.670,皇上出了个对联,,,
00:34:23.520,00:34:26.150,无论是太监或是宫女,00:34:22.304,00:34:24.852,His Majesty has a couplet riddle for everyone.
00:34:26.480,00:34:29.630,谁要能对得上的 皇上重重有赏,00:34:24.852,00:34:30.893,"Any eunuch or maid who can solve it
will be amply rewarded."
00:34:30.320,00:34:32.750,那就劳烦公公说给咱们听听,00:34:31.461,00:34:34.307,"Please tell us the riddle, sir."
00:34:33.680,00:34:35.630,咱们大伙儿虽然不太懂,,,
00:34:35.920,00:34:38.480,但是也可以和大家一同乐一乐嘛,00:34:35.029,00:34:39.312,It will be fun even if we don't know much about riddles.
00:34:41.440,00:34:42.420,可都听清了,,,
00:34:43.080,00:34:46.750,皇上的上联是逆风如解意,00:34:42.900,00:34:45.802,"Listen up, the first line is"
,,,00:34:46.292,00:34:48.302,"""If the northern wind can hear the plum flowers."""
00:34:55.480,00:34:56.540,有谁知道啊,00:34:56.689,00:34:58.550,Does anyone know the second line?
00:35:02.160,00:35:04.830,容易莫摧残,00:35:03.515,00:35:06.410,"""Spare the blooming wishes for a peaceful spring."""
00:35:16.920,00:35:20.070,你心有旁骛 败局已定,00:35:18.083,00:35:21.378,"Your mind is elsewhere.
The game is over."
00:35:22.160,00:35:22.950,输了,,,
00:35:23.880,00:35:24.590,臣弟的棋艺,00:35:23.238,00:35:24.618,I lost.
00:35:24.840,00:35:26.350,根本就不能与皇兄相较量,00:35:25.217,00:35:27.700,My skills are no match for Your Majesty.
00:35:32.200,00:35:35.150,皇上 您盼咐奴才办的事,,,
00:35:35.600,00:35:37.070,奴才已经尽力去办了,00:35:34.903,00:35:38.531,"Your Majesty, I've completed the task to the best of my ability."
00:35:37.560,00:35:38.430,但是,,,
00:35:40.240,00:35:41.630,皇兄只说了上半句,00:35:38.720,00:35:40.000,But...
00:35:42.000,00:35:43.630,这下半句苏培盛不知道,00:35:41.578,00:35:45.043,"Your Majesty didn't say the answer to the riddle.
Su Peisheng doesn't know the second line."
00:35:44.240,00:35:45.430,这差事不好办吧,00:35:45.269,00:35:46.880,That must be a difficult job.
00:35:45.760,00:35:48.670,你办不好是你不中用,00:35:46.920,00:35:50.000,"If it's not done well,
that's because you lack competence."
00:35:49.080,00:35:49.830,皇上息怒,,,
00:35:50.520,00:35:52.110,皇上您下了半天的棋了,00:35:50.040,00:35:51.615,May Your Majesty calm your anger.
00:35:52.400,00:35:53.430,也该口渴了,00:35:51.615,00:35:54.500,Your Majesty must be thirsty after the game.
00:35:53.800,00:35:55.190,若真要责怪奴才,,,
00:35:55.480,00:35:56.910,也请先喝口茶吧,00:35:55.006,00:35:58.240,Please have a cup of tea before punishing me.
00:36:20.640,00:36:24.790,这茶是用梅花上的雪水泡的吗,00:36:21.885,00:36:26.083,Is the tea made of the snow on the plum flowers?
00:36:25.880,00:36:27.550,怎么有一股梅香呢,,,
00:36:28.800,00:36:30.870,皇上恕罪是奴婢身上,00:36:27.006,00:36:29.217,It smells of plum blossoms.
00:36:31.200,00:36:32.870,不小心染上了梅花气味,00:36:30.000,00:36:34.139,"I beg Your Majesty's pardon.
That is the smell of my clothes."
00:36:33.280,00:36:34.260,惊扰圣驾,,,
00:36:34.800,00:36:35.940,皇兄身边的下人们,00:36:34.139,00:36:35.971,I didn't mean to disturb Your Majesty.
00:36:36.240,00:36:37.270,真是越来越别致了啊,00:36:35.971,00:36:38.676,Your Majesty certainly has unique attendants.
00:36:37.960,00:36:38.710,回头啊,,,
00:36:38.960,00:36:40.230,我也让府里的下人们,,,
00:36:40.600,00:36:41.740,个个都身染花香,00:36:39.031,00:36:42.861,"I will ask my servants to also
soak themselves in the smell of flowers."
00:36:42.040,00:36:43.830,朕瞧着你眼生,00:36:43.200,00:36:45.308,I don't remember seeing you before.
00:36:44.760,00:36:46.430,什么时候来御前伺候的,00:36:45.572,00:36:47.761,When did you start serving here?
00:36:49.360,00:36:51.950,逆风如解意 容易莫摧残,00:36:50.534,00:36:53.640,"""If the northern wind can hear the plum flowers,
spare the blooming wishes for a peaceful spring."""
00:36:52.400,00:36:55.030,在倚梅园侍弄花草 劳作辛苦,00:36:53.740,00:36:56.511,I was tending to the flowers in the Garden of Leaning Plums.
00:36:55.440,00:36:56.790,得蒙苏总管关爱,,,
00:36:57.280,00:36:59.110,所以奴婢才有幸,,,
00:36:59.520,00:37:01.030,来到御前伺候一次,00:36:56.700,00:37:02.360,"Mr. Su pitied my hard work,
and offered me the honor to serve Your Majesty once."
00:37:02.040,00:37:04.030,一路上过来冷不冷啊,00:37:03.154,00:37:05.522,Was it cold walking all the way here?
00:37:05.680,00:37:06.710,风雪已停,,,
00:37:06.960,00:37:10.430,比除夕之夜弄湿了鞋袜要好许多,00:37:07.000,00:37:11.720,"The wind and snow have stopped.
It's much better than the shoe-drenching night on New Year's Eve."
00:37:17.440,00:37:18.950,难为你的心思了,00:37:18.678,00:37:20.331,You did a thoughtful job.
00:37:20.280,00:37:22.230,奴婢还有倚梅园的工夫要做,,,
00:37:22.720,00:37:23.860,先行告退,00:37:21.476,00:37:24.896,"Your Majesty, I shall return to my work in the garden."
00:37:24.520,00:37:26.350,倚梅园多的是梅花,00:37:25.679,00:37:27.812,The garden is full of plum flowers.
00:37:27.240,00:37:29.670,朕这儿倒缺一缕梅香,00:37:28.491,00:37:31.072,But I need one in my palace.
00:37:30.200,00:37:31.390,你且留下吧,00:37:31.449,00:37:33.009,You may stay here.
00:37:32.920,00:37:35.150,多谢皇上 多谢皇上,00:37:33.980,00:37:36.349,I thank Your Majesty.
00:37:35.400,00:37:36.310,你叫什么名啊,00:37:36.500,00:37:37.840,What is your name?
00:37:37.400,00:37:39.630,奴婢贱名余莺儿,00:37:38.820,00:37:40.960,My humble name is Yu Ying'er.
00:37:41.040,00:37:46.630,封倚梅园宫女余莺儿为官女子,00:37:42.200,00:37:47.825,Yu Ying'er is granted the title of Escort.
00:37:47.280,00:37:49.070,赐居钟粹宫,00:37:48.278,00:37:50.560,She will reside in the Palace of Accumulated Purity.
00:37:49.600,00:37:50.390,嗻,00:37:50.560,00:37:51.609,Yes.
00:37:50.760,00:37:53.030,皇上万岁万岁万万岁,00:37:51.986,00:37:54.340,Long live the Emperor!
00:37:54.200,00:37:57.030,玉楼金阙慵归去,,,
00:37:57.760,00:38:00.950,且插梅花醉洛阳,00:37:55.317,00:38:02.421,"""Rather than a leisurely return to Heaven’s jade and gold palaces,
I would instead be drunk among the flowering Luoyang plums."""
00:38:05.880,00:38:07.550,姑娘不明白皇上的意思,00:38:07.139,00:38:09.377,Do you not understand what His Majesty said?
00:38:08.800,00:38:11.670,奴婢不明白 还请王爷明白告诉,00:38:09.960,00:38:13.007,"No, I hope Your Lordship can enlighten me."
00:38:12.320,00:38:13.460,这是李白的诗,,,
00:38:14.000,00:38:16.030,皇上喜欢李白的诗,00:38:13.475,00:38:17.795,"It is a poem by Li Bai. His Majesty likes Li Bai.
[It's not by Li Bai. He's testing her.]"
00:38:18.120,00:38:20.230,奴婢知道了 多谢王爷,00:38:19.373,00:38:22.093,I thank Your Lordship. I understand now.
00:38:24.480,00:38:25.430,王爷走好,,,
00:38:27.120,00:38:28.100,你这要去哪儿啊,00:38:25.500,00:38:27.267,I bid Your Lordship goodbye.
00:38:28.520,00:38:30.230,奴才正要到内务府,00:38:27.986,00:38:29.717,Where are you heading to?
00:38:30.520,00:38:31.710,跟敬事房存档呢,00:38:29.906,00:38:33.278,"I'm going to register the new concubine
with the Household Department and Attendance Services."
00:38:33.080,00:38:35.590,公公办好了差事 皇上要赏你,00:38:34.180,00:38:37.080,"His Majesty will reward you for your hard work, sir."
00:38:36.440,00:38:37.710,奴才不敢 不敢,00:38:37.160,00:38:39.360,I dare not think of that.
00:38:38.680,00:38:39.510,公公慢走,,,
00:38:39.880,00:38:41.190,这路走错了不打紧,,,
00:38:41.520,00:38:42.390,这东西交错了人,,,
00:38:42.840,00:38:43.820,那可就不好办了,00:38:39.804,00:38:46.193,"When you deliver something, it's better to take the wrong route
than to hand over the wrong thing."
00:38:53.240,00:38:54.870,你会唱昆曲,,,
00:38:55.680,00:38:57.430,奴婢的父亲是昆曲班子的,00:38:54.629,00:38:56.340,You can sing Kunqu Opera?
00:38:57.840,00:38:59.190,所以奴婢会唱两句,00:38:57.309,00:39:00.560,I learned it from my father. He's in a Kunqu troupe.
00:39:03.680,00:39:06.430,王爷您刚才说东西交错了人,00:39:04.848,00:39:08.108,"Your Lordship was saying ""to hand over the wrong thing""."
00:39:06.960,00:39:09.910,这意思是 能否请王爷明示啊,00:39:08.384,00:39:11.187,Would Your Lordship clarify that for me?
00:39:10.960,00:39:12.390,我不过随口说说罢了,00:39:12.226,00:39:14.092,It was just a thought I had. Don't mind it.
00:39:21.920,00:39:24.070,有桩奇事可要说与你听听,00:39:23.101,00:39:25.312,A strange thing happened in the palace.
00:39:24.720,00:39:25.780,又有什么新鲜事,,,
00:39:26.840,00:39:28.150,皇上不知怎的,00:39:25.826,00:39:27.238,What is it?
00:39:28.440,00:39:30.190,看上了倚梅园的一个宫女,00:39:28.161,00:39:31.825,"His Majesty somehow became fond of
a maid from the Garden of Leaning Plums."
00:39:31.480,00:39:33.150,先是封了官女子,,,
00:39:33.480,00:39:34.990,前儿又晋了答应,00:39:32.731,00:39:36.311,"She was first titled Escort,
and has just been promoted to Companion."
00:39:36.760,00:39:38.710,是倚梅园,00:39:37.880,00:39:40.280,From... the Garden of Leaning Plums?
00:39:39.080,00:39:39.870,是啊,00:39:40.360,00:39:41.480,Yes.
00:39:43.080,00:39:45.590,皇上看上宫女也是常有的事,00:39:44.340,00:39:47.040,It is not uncommon for an emperor to favor a maid.
00:39:46.600,00:39:48.510,如今皇上很宠她呢,00:39:48.000,00:39:49.860,His Majesty dotes on her.
00:39:49.480,00:39:50.350,能和你比吗,00:39:50.620,00:39:52.040,As much as you?
00:39:53.600,00:39:54.820,快要赶上我了,00:39:54.900,00:39:56.207,Almost as much.
00:39:55.600,00:39:57.430,听说她还会唱昆曲,00:39:56.782,00:39:59.003,I heard that she can sing Kunqu.
00:39:59.000,00:39:59.950,果然新鲜,,,
00:40:00.800,00:40:02.270,插着花儿听着曲儿,00:40:00.080,00:40:01.300,That is a novelty.
00:40:02.680,00:40:03.550,我也喜欢,00:40:02.060,00:40:04.918,"I would also like a girl who's good at
arranging flowers and singing Kunqu."
00:40:04.840,00:40:06.510,不过皇上再如何宠她,,,
00:40:06.800,00:40:07.940,她的出身搁在那儿,,,
00:40:08.280,00:40:09.260,也越不过你去,00:40:06.118,00:40:10.324,"But regardless of how favored she is,
with her background she will not surpass you."
00:40:09.600,00:40:10.870,这个我自然知道,00:40:10.626,00:40:12.220,I know that.
00:40:11.280,00:40:13.660,只是陵容心里不快活,00:40:12.446,00:40:14.900,But Lingrong is not happy about it.
00:40:14.160,00:40:17.110,也是 都入宫那么久了,00:40:15.211,00:40:16.426,Right.
00:40:17.480,00:40:19.270,她到现在都还没有侍寝,00:40:16.841,00:40:20.536,She has not even served His Majesty yet.
00:40:19.880,00:40:21.550,别人承宠也就罢了,,,
00:40:21.920,00:40:22.870,偏偏是个身份,,,
00:40:23.120,00:40:24.710,比她微贱十倍的宫女,00:40:21.082,00:40:26.060,"She doesn't mind the other concubines,
but this one has a birth ten times humbler than hers."
00:40:25.120,00:40:27.350,如今又和她平起平坐了,,,
00:40:27.720,00:40:29.430,她心里自然是不痛快,00:40:26.286,00:40:30.826,It upsets her now that they are at the same rank.
00:40:30.200,00:40:31.710,陵容那么久没侍寝,,,
00:40:32.680,00:40:34.150,难道是她自己不想承宠,00:40:31.320,00:40:35.620,Does Lingrong not want to serve His Majesty and gain more favor?
00:40:35.760,00:40:37.590,皇上不常来后宫,,,
00:40:37.880,00:40:40.150,即使来了也是去华妃,00:40:37.011,00:40:39.191,His Majesty is a rare visitor to the harem.
00:40:40.360,00:40:42.150,和几个得宠的妃嫔那儿,00:40:39.191,00:40:43.440,"When he does come,
he only visits Consort Fleur and a few others."
00:40:43.160,00:40:45.620,你是知道宫中的人何等势利,00:40:44.195,00:40:46.878,You know how the people treat you in the palace.
00:40:46.000,00:40:49.230,没有恩宠 活得连奴才也不如,00:40:47.234,00:40:50.512,"You would live worse than a maid
if you aren't favored by His Majesty."
00:40:50.360,00:40:52.270,这话让旁人说也就罢了,,,
00:40:52.720,00:40:55.470,你可是入宫以来恩宠不断的,00:40:51.800,00:40:56.936,"The other concubines might say that.
But you have been continuously favored since arriving."
00:40:56.440,00:40:59.070,看着别人 我也有点害怕,00:40:57.540,00:41:00.550,I'm just concerned now that I've seen others.
00:40:59.880,00:41:02.630,要是有一天我也失宠了,00:41:01.183,00:41:03.766,What if one day I fall out of favor too?
00:41:03.000,00:41:04.630,且不论姐姐心志家世,,,
00:41:05.120,00:41:06.910,但凭皇上对姐姐的情意,,,
00:41:07.400,00:41:09.110,姐姐是断断不会失宠的,00:41:04.171,00:41:10.560,"Not even to mention your intellect and background,
His Majesty's affection for you will not let that happen."
00:41:10.080,00:41:11.190,但愿如此,00:41:11.318,00:41:12.629,I do hope so.
00:41:15.240,00:41:16.910,小主 元宵的节礼下来了,,,
00:41:17.240,00:41:18.430,请小主回去瞧瞧,00:41:16.444,00:41:18.935,"My Lady, we have gifts for the Lantern Festival.
[the 15th of the first lunar month]"
00:41:19.320,00:41:20.270,那我先走了,00:41:18.935,00:41:20.299,Please go check on them.
,,,00:41:20.299,00:41:21.700,I will leave now.
00:41:42.560,00:41:43.830,给沈贵人请安,00:41:43.774,00:41:45.554,Peace to Noble Lady Shen.
00:41:45.400,00:41:46.510,余妹妹有礼了,00:41:46.397,00:41:48.444,Companion Yu is being courteous.
00:41:49.680,00:41:53.300,天寒地滑 皇上怕我摔着,00:41:51.017,00:41:53.120,The roads are wet and slippery.
00:41:54.080,00:41:55.830,特意赏了一乘辇轿,00:41:53.240,00:41:57.049,"His Majesty bestowed a sedan
to escort me on my trips."
00:41:56.960,00:42:00.390,请恕妹妹不便下轿给姐姐请安了,00:41:58.200,00:42:01.416,"Please pardon my inconvenience
to greet you on the ground."
00:42:00.680,00:42:01.740,妹妹说得是啊,00:42:01.642,00:42:03.096,You're right.
00:42:02.280,00:42:05.310,若是摔着了 可如何伺候皇上呢,00:42:03.435,00:42:06.753,"If you fell, you wouldn't be able to serve His Majesty."
00:42:06.640,00:42:07.700,贵人姐姐,,,
00:42:08.520,00:42:10.470,妹妹刚从华妃娘娘处过来,,,
00:42:11.040,00:42:12.430,要去向皇后请安,00:42:07.946,00:42:13.829,"Noble Lady, I came from Consort Fleur's palace
and I'm going pay respects to Her Majesty."
00:42:13.320,00:42:15.880,不知姐姐能否让我先过去,00:42:14.561,00:42:17.280,Will you please make way for me?

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
