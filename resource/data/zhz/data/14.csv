00:02:25.320,00:02:27.110,华妃 你是怎么了,00:02:25.900,00:02:28.880,"Consort Fleur, what is the matter with you?"
00:02:27.960,00:02:30.790,这么好的日子 你干嘛要扫兴啊,00:02:29.160,00:02:32.400,Why would you spoil the mood on such a joyous day?
00:02:34.800,00:02:36.510,臣妾并无什么委屈,00:02:36.026,00:02:38.060,It's not that I harbor grievances against anyone.
00:02:38.000,00:02:40.910,只是见莞贵人作惊鸿舞,00:02:39.206,00:02:42.240,"Seeing Lady Sourire perform ""Dance of the Startled Swan"""
00:02:41.840,00:02:44.870,一时触动情肠才有所失仪,00:02:42.685,00:02:45.800,"deeply touched me in my heart of hearts,
and I slipped on decorum."
00:02:45.800,00:02:48.990,昔日纯元皇后作惊鸿舞的时候,,,
00:02:49.240,00:02:50.220,你尚未入府,00:02:46.906,00:02:51.700,"You had not entered the family
when Empress Première performed the ""Startled Swan."""
00:02:51.200,00:02:54.030,如何会有情肠可触,00:02:52.389,00:02:55.880,Why are you emotional about the dance today?
00:02:55.840,00:02:58.270,臣妾闲来翻阅诗书,00:02:56.640,00:02:59.601,"I've been idling away my days reading poetry,"
00:02:58.640,00:03:02.510,见有唐玄宗梅妃楼东赋一篇,00:02:59.827,00:03:03.559,"I stumbled upon ""Lament from the East Tower"" by Consort Mei."
00:03:03.320,00:03:04.830,读来触动惊心,00:03:04.326,00:03:06.575,Her poem filled me with dread.
00:03:06.000,00:03:10.150,惊鸿舞出自梅妃 为得宠时所舞,00:03:07.120,00:03:11.200,"Consort Mei composed ""Dance of the Startled Swan""
when she was in high favor with Emperor Xuanzong."
00:03:11.480,00:03:14.870,楼东赋则写于幽闭上阳宫之时,00:03:12.577,00:03:16.421,She wrote this poem during the time she was confined to Shangyang Palace.
00:03:16.200,00:03:19.430,今日见惊鸿舞而思楼东赋,00:03:17.266,00:03:20.959,"The ""Startled Swan"" today brought my mind to her ""Lament from the East Tower."""
00:03:20.920,00:03:23.630,臣妾为梅妃伤感不已,00:03:21.716,00:03:25.003,I can't refrain from feeling sad for Consort Mei.
00:03:25.280,00:03:28.590,你一向不在诗书上留心,00:03:26.349,00:03:29.720,You've never shown much interest in poetry before.
00:03:29.240,00:03:31.430,如今竟有如此兴致了,00:03:30.463,00:03:32.583,Why have you become fond of reading poems?
00:03:31.840,00:03:32.950,臣妾愚昧,,,
00:03:33.880,00:03:36.180,闻听诗书可以怡情养性,00:03:32.788,00:03:37.526,I heard that poetry and literature can enlighten untutored minds.
00:03:37.240,00:03:39.150,臣妾自知无德无才,00:03:38.427,00:03:40.142,"Devoid of talent and virtue,"
00:03:39.560,00:03:40.700,若不修身养性,,,
00:03:41.520,00:03:43.710,实在无颜面再侍奉皇上,00:03:40.289,00:03:45.160,"I will not have the face to serve Your Majesty
if I don't cultivate my character."
00:03:44.360,00:03:47.870,你既说对楼东赋有感,00:03:45.427,00:03:49.050,"Since you sympathize with the poem,"
00:03:49.040,00:03:50.310,何不说来听听,00:03:50.080,00:03:51.825,why not share your thoughts with us?
00:03:54.320,00:03:59.590,君情缱绻 深叙绸缪,00:03:55.369,00:04:00.940,"“Your fond words said
your love would bind us inseparably.”"
00:04:00.160,00:04:04.790,誓山海而常在 似日月而无休,00:04:01.000,00:04:06.623,"""It’ll endure as the sun and the moon,"" you vowed,
""it’ll abide as mountains and seas."""
00:04:06.600,00:04:10.380,奈何嫉色慵慵 妒气冲冲,00:04:07.400,00:04:11.840,"“How she [Yang Guifei, another consort]
seethed with wrathful jealousy.”"
00:04:11.640,00:04:15.310,夺我之爱幸 斥我于幽宫,00:04:12.285,00:04:17.070,"“She deprived me of your love,
banishing me into this forlorn tower.”"
00:04:17.240,00:04:22.910,思旧欢之莫得 想梦着乎朦胧,00:04:18.278,00:04:24.476,"“No more can I reach the bliss of yesteryears;
in dreams, I see only a hazy memory.”"
00:04:25.240,00:04:26.870,臣妾每每读到此处,00:04:26.353,00:04:28.462,"Every time I read these lines,"
00:04:27.680,00:04:30.950,都深感梅妃思君情长,00:04:28.773,00:04:32.077,"I am deeply saddened by Consort Mei's
love and longing for her husband."
00:04:40.400,00:04:42.860,皇上 华妃娘娘之事,,,
00:04:43.520,00:04:45.230,本是皇上后宫家事,00:04:41.559,00:04:46.580,"Your Majesty, the matter concerning Consort Fleur
is a family affair within your harem."
00:04:45.600,00:04:47.270,臣弟不敢插嘴,00:04:46.844,00:04:48.744,I dare not comment on it.
00:04:47.840,00:04:51.110,只是华妃娘娘侍奉皇上多年,,,
00:04:51.520,00:04:53.590,未曾有过什么大错,00:04:49.103,00:04:54.943,"But Her Highness hasn't committed
any serious wrongs while serving Your Majesty all these years."
00:04:54.440,00:04:56.110,若有侍奉不到之处,00:04:55.299,00:04:57.580,"If there was something unthoughtful in her service,"
00:04:56.440,00:04:59.310,还望皇上念其多年伴驾,,,
00:04:59.920,00:05:01.550,原谅娘娘,00:04:57.580,00:05:02.700,"I hope Your Majesty can forgive Her Highness
considering her many years of dedicated service."
00:05:06.640,00:05:11.150,华妃 实在是难为你了,00:05:07.667,00:05:08.879,"Consort Fleur,"
,,,00:05:09.814,00:05:12.451,it must have been hard on you.
00:05:12.280,00:05:14.030,你住的地方太过偏僻,00:05:13.330,00:05:15.599,Your residence in the Summer Palace is quite remote.
00:05:14.880,00:05:17.150,朕若得空就常去看你,00:05:16.041,00:05:18.400,I'll visit you more often when I have the time.
00:05:20.920,00:05:22.310,臣妾谢过皇上,00:05:21.901,00:05:24.031,I thank Your Majesty.
00:05:26.480,00:05:28.110,妹妹想问曹姐姐一句,00:05:27.291,00:05:29.362,"Cao, I am curious to know..."
00:05:28.680,00:05:30.510,那张写着惊鸿舞的纸条,,,
00:05:31.120,00:05:33.150,是一直握在姐姐袖子里的吧,00:05:29.688,00:05:34.392,"The slip with ""Dance of the Startled Swan"" written on it
was hidden in your sleeve, wasn't it?"
00:05:34.640,00:05:36.150,所以妹妹今日一舞,,,
00:05:36.760,00:05:38.550,竟是姐姐为我注定的呢,00:05:36.000,00:05:39.740,"So my dance was not destined, but orchestrated to happen."
00:05:39.440,00:05:40.580,姐姐有心了,,,
00:05:41.720,00:05:42.830,妹妹你说什么,00:05:40.277,00:05:42.160,I must thank you for the effort.
00:05:43.480,00:05:44.910,姐姐我听不明白,00:05:42.720,00:05:44.344,"Sourire, what are you talking about?"
00:05:45.840,00:05:47.030,姐姐聪慧,00:05:44.515,00:05:46.495,I do not understand.
00:05:47.680,00:05:49.430,自然知道没有惊鸿舞,00:05:46.833,00:05:48.569,Your acute mind must understand that
00:05:49.760,00:05:50.950,就不会有楼东赋,00:05:48.758,00:05:52.508,"without ""Startled Swan,"" ""Lament from the East Tower""
would not have been written."
00:05:52.280,00:05:54.270,梅妃含情所著的楼东赋,,,
00:05:54.520,00:05:56.550,没有能使她再度得幸于唐玄宗,00:05:53.415,00:05:57.840,"While Consort Mei's heart-rending poem
failed to rekindle the love of Emperor Xuanzong,"
00:05:57.240,00:05:59.190,倒是华妃娘娘感动了皇上,00:05:58.302,00:06:00.842,Her Highness Consort Fleur moved His Majesty deeply.
00:06:00.640,00:06:02.550,想来梅妃若芳魂有知,,,
00:06:03.040,00:06:05.190,也会感知姐姐这番苦心吧,00:06:02.000,00:06:06.560,"Consort Mei's unrestful soul
must be so appreciative of your painstaking effort."
00:06:05.880,00:06:09.110,妹妹 你说什么便是什么吧,00:06:07.000,00:06:10.340,"It is whatever you say, Sourire."
00:06:09.720,00:06:12.550,姐姐我笨口拙舌的也辩不明白,00:06:11.000,00:06:14.100,My tongue lacks the eloquence to vindicate myself.
00:06:13.160,00:06:15.430,只是妹妹你若有空,,,
00:06:15.640,00:06:17.590,还是好好照顾惠贵人的胎吧,00:06:14.280,00:06:18.880,"Perhaps you should spend all your free time
taking care of Lady Vertu's pregnancy."
00:06:18.040,00:06:20.500,毕竟那才是皇上真正关心的,00:06:19.000,00:06:21.700,"After all, that's His Majesty's prime concern."
00:06:20.880,00:06:21.830,那是必然的,00:06:21.860,00:06:23.300,By all means.
00:06:34.600,00:06:36.510,费了这样大的心思扳倒她,,,
00:06:37.040,00:06:38.020,如今却要眼睁睁地,,,
00:06:38.400,00:06:39.430,看着她东山再起,00:06:35.920,00:06:40.820,"We exerted so much effort trying to bring her down,
only to watch her rise up again."
00:06:40.240,00:06:41.710,叫我怎么甘心呢,,,
00:06:42.360,00:06:43.750,其实姐姐心里清楚,00:06:41.000,00:06:43.260,I can't accept this!
00:06:44.280,00:06:46.350,华妃再起本是意料中事,00:06:43.400,00:06:47.680,"Meizhuang, you know this.
Her rising is expected."
00:06:47.120,00:06:48.470,不过时间早晚而已,00:06:48.000,00:06:49.800,It's always just a matter of time.
00:06:49.280,00:06:51.550,我是怕这日子又要难过了,00:06:50.433,00:06:53.000,I'm just afraid that our life will become difficult again.
00:06:52.960,00:06:54.510,有姐姐肚子里的这一位,,,
00:06:54.760,00:06:55.740,咱们什么都不怕,00:06:53.920,00:06:57.400,"With this sweetheart in your belly,
there's nothing we should worry about."
00:06:56.560,00:06:57.910,所以姐姐勿要动气,,,
00:06:58.560,00:06:59.750,好好安胎要紧,00:06:57.800,00:07:01.300,"Don't let anything upset you.
Your pregnancy matters the most."
00:07:00.120,00:07:01.470,他才一个多月大,,,
00:07:01.800,00:07:03.470,是男是女还不知道呢,00:07:01.400,00:07:04.680,"It's only been one month.
We don't even know if it's a boy or a girl."
00:07:03.680,00:07:04.590,男女都好,,,
00:07:04.840,00:07:06.270,都是咱们的心肝宝贝,00:07:04.720,00:07:07.734,"Regardless, they will always be our dearest baby."
00:07:07.440,00:07:08.310,宝贝呀,,,
00:07:08.720,00:07:11.430,好好劝劝你额娘别再生气啦,00:07:08.584,00:07:12.840,"Dear baby, please tell your mother to stop feeling upset."
00:07:13.400,00:07:15.150,你啊 就爱胡说,00:07:14.555,00:07:16.375,Stop talking nonsense.
00:07:16.440,00:07:17.500,其实今日之事,,,
00:07:17.840,00:07:19.470,皇后只会比咱们更头痛,00:07:17.344,00:07:20.522,"What happened today will be more of a headache
to the Empress than to us."
00:07:19.960,00:07:21.950,皇后都不着急 咱们急什么,00:07:20.860,00:07:23.320,Let's not fret when Her Majesty doesn't.
00:07:23.000,00:07:24.220,你说得也是,,,
00:07:25.040,00:07:27.110,可是今儿我看你跳舞的时候,00:07:24.120,00:07:25.700,You are right.
00:07:27.360,00:07:28.630,可把我担心坏了,00:07:26.242,00:07:29.433,But I couldn't help feeling worried when you were dancing.
00:07:28.960,00:07:30.350,我知道你会跳舞,00:07:29.840,00:07:31.611,I knew that you could dance well.
00:07:30.600,00:07:33.590,却不知原来跳与不跳都是过错,00:07:31.611,00:07:35.035,"But I never expected it would be an offense
either way - dancing, or not."
00:07:34.320,00:07:35.870,今日之事是侥幸,00:07:35.520,00:07:37.240,I got by with sheer luck.
00:07:36.680,00:07:40.030,倒是曹贵人城府之深 防不胜防,00:07:38.020,00:07:41.240,"But we can never be too careful given
Lady Cao's deep cunning and guile."
00:07:40.840,00:07:41.950,她再要害你,,,
00:07:42.200,00:07:43.870,也架不住皇上喜欢你,00:07:42.000,00:07:45.060,"No matter how she tried to harm you,
you are shielded by His Majesty's favor."
00:07:44.920,00:07:47.350,倒是你 瞒着皇上好辛苦,00:07:45.900,00:07:48.427,But why were you hiding your talents from His Majesty?
00:07:47.840,00:07:48.950,你若早露一手,,,
00:07:49.320,00:07:51.150,她也不敢拿这个算计你,00:07:48.783,00:07:52.540,"If she had seen your skills beforehand,
she wouldn't have plotted this against you."
00:07:51.400,00:07:52.150,万幸,,,
00:07:52.360,00:07:54.030,她们不知道我会什么不会什么,00:07:52.600,00:07:55.300,"Fortunately, they are not aware of my strengths and shortcomings."
00:07:54.320,00:07:56.750,否则岂不更放心大胆地算计我,00:07:55.400,00:07:57.920,"Otherwise, they would be even bolder in their plots."
00:08:01.880,00:08:02.710,启禀莞贵人,,,
00:08:03.160,00:08:04.270,皇上得了些好诗,,,
00:08:04.600,00:08:06.470,请您往勤政殿一同品评,00:08:03.022,00:08:07.800,"Lady Sourire, His Majesty invites you to appreciate
his newly collected poems at the Governance Hall."
00:08:07.400,00:08:09.700,那你快去吧 别叫皇上等着,00:08:08.600,00:08:11.187,Go immediately. Don't make His Majesty wait.
00:08:10.840,00:08:11.710,那我先去了,00:08:12.080,00:08:13.320,I'll go now.
00:08:20.800,00:08:21.550,苏公公,,,
00:08:21.920,00:08:22.830,莞贵人吉祥,00:08:21.526,00:08:22.582,Mr Su.
,,,00:08:22.582,00:08:24.226,Peace to Lady Sourire.
00:08:23.880,00:08:26.070,前朝几位大人正在里头呢,00:08:25.004,00:08:27.301,His Majesty is currently in a meeting with some officials.
00:08:26.560,00:08:28.350,麻烦小主稍等片刻,00:08:27.524,00:08:29.657,"I hope you won't mind waiting here for a while, My Lady."
00:08:28.920,00:08:29.550,是,,,
00:08:31.080,00:08:31.950,皇上,00:08:30.260,00:08:31.191,Certainly.
00:08:32.280,00:08:34.660,如今朝廷还正在对西北用兵,00:08:32.295,00:08:35.755,"Your Majesty, considering the ongoing wars in the northwest,"
00:08:35.280,00:08:38.150,华妃之兄年羹尧正在效命之时,00:08:36.300,00:08:39.400,"the service of Consort Fleur's brother
Nian Gengyao is crucial to the state."
00:08:38.840,00:08:40.190,望皇上三思啊,00:08:40.000,00:08:41.640,I hope Your Majesty will reconsider.
00:08:41.600,00:08:44.830,朝廷正在用人之际 事从权宜,00:08:42.500,00:08:46.360,"At this juncture, a decision regarding court appointments should be expedient."
00:08:45.080,00:08:46.790,皇上宽恕华妃娘娘,,,
00:08:47.040,00:08:48.630,也是安定军心哪,00:08:46.360,00:08:49.980,"Your Majesty's forgiveness of Consort Fleur
will also lift military morale."
00:08:49.320,00:08:51.830,朕知道了 你们退下吧,00:08:50.453,00:08:53.156,I understand. You can leave now.
00:08:56.240,00:08:57.870,小主吉祥 小主吉祥,00:08:57.340,00:08:59.040,Peace to My Lady.
00:09:01.240,00:09:02.380,小主 请,00:09:02.400,00:09:04.040,"My Lady, please."
00:09:06.600,00:09:08.630,皇上 莞贵人来了,00:09:07.641,00:09:09.712,"Your Majesty, Lady Sourire is here."
00:09:11.720,00:09:12.990,臣妾给皇上请安,,,
00:09:13.400,00:09:14.710,皇上万福金安,00:09:13.000,00:09:16.020,"I bow before Your Majesty.
Peace and grace to Your Majesty."
00:09:15.520,00:09:18.950,朕头痛得很 你来帮朕揉一揉,00:09:16.599,00:09:20.119,I have a headache. I can use a massage from you.
00:09:19.840,00:09:20.510,是,00:09:21.010,00:09:22.200,Yes.
00:09:38.160,00:09:39.380,皇上有烦心事,00:09:39.100,00:09:40.960,Is something troubling Your Majesty?
00:09:40.560,00:09:41.470,你怎么知道,00:09:41.450,00:09:43.080,How do you know?
00:09:43.960,00:09:45.750,殿中虽供着茉莉花,,,
00:09:46.280,00:09:47.910,可臣妾还是闻到了,00:09:45.320,00:09:50.780,"Despite jasmine flowers being placed in the chamber,
I can still detect the scent of menthol."
00:09:48.240,00:09:49.380,薄荷脑油的气味,,,
00:09:50.960,00:09:52.550,皇上只要遇到烦心事,,,
00:09:53.080,00:09:54.190,就会用薄荷脑油,00:09:52.240,00:09:55.740,"I know Your Majesty applies menthol
when something is bothering you."
00:09:55.560,00:09:57.230,你一向善解人意,00:09:56.760,00:09:58.949,You are always attentive to my mind.
00:10:01.680,00:10:05.630,你便猜一猜朕为什么烦心,00:10:02.880,00:10:07.080,Take a guess at what is bothering me.
00:10:07.120,00:10:08.430,皇上心系天下,,,
00:10:09.080,00:10:10.990,自然是为了朝廷中事烦恼,00:10:08.338,00:10:12.258,"Your Majesty is concerned with everything under Heaven.
It must be some trouble at court."
00:10:13.080,00:10:14.300,你说得不错,,,
00:10:14.960,00:10:17.310,其实后宫也是天下的一部分,00:10:14.640,00:10:15.956,You are not wrong.
00:10:17.720,00:10:19.030,朕也要烦心,00:10:16.220,00:10:20.560,"But the harem falls under Heaven as well,
and it too gives me trouble."
00:10:21.280,00:10:24.430,皇后娘娘独自执掌后宫大小事宜,,,
00:10:24.680,00:10:25.390,很是辛苦,00:10:22.396,00:10:27.064,"It has been hard on Her Majesty the Empress
to single-handedly manage all the affairs in the harem."
00:10:26.400,00:10:27.830,该有人为她分忧了,00:10:27.390,00:10:29.320,It is time someone share her burden.
00:10:29.200,00:10:29.990,你怎么看,,,
00:10:30.960,00:10:32.710,华妃娘娘一直协理六宫,00:10:30.260,00:10:31.800,What do you think?
00:10:33.640,00:10:34.780,能为皇后分忧,00:10:32.440,00:10:36.380,"Consort Fleur has always assisted
Her Majesty with palace affairs."
00:10:35.960,00:10:38.710,何况昔日之事只是丽嫔的过错,00:10:37.149,00:10:40.109,Whatever happened was the mistake of Concubine Beauté.
00:10:39.360,00:10:41.070,未必与华妃娘娘有干系,00:10:40.599,00:10:42.859,Consort Fleur was not necessarily involved.
00:10:42.440,00:10:45.000,再说 太后介意的,,,
00:10:45.280,00:10:46.590,只是华妃有些独断,00:10:43.700,00:10:48.040,"Her Majesty the Empress Dowager was just dissatisfied
 over Consort Fleur being a little overbearing."
00:10:47.680,00:10:49.190,如今给的教训也够了,00:10:48.653,00:10:50.707,I believe Her Highness has learned a lesson.
00:10:54.640,00:10:55.670,华妃的事,,,
00:10:57.600,00:10:59.150,肯定会让你受些委屈,00:10:56.000,00:11:00.540,"But Consort Fleur....
That will make you feel aggrieved."
00:11:00.800,00:11:04.310,只是你放心 朕必然会护着你,00:11:02.040,00:11:05.538,"But don't worry, I'll protect you from any harm."
00:11:07.920,00:11:09.030,只要是为了皇上,,,
00:11:09.960,00:11:12.110,臣妾就没有什么委屈的,00:11:09.180,00:11:13.860,"I will never feel aggrieved over anything
 if it's for Your Majesty."
00:11:18.720,00:11:19.990,今日倒是稀罕了,,,
00:11:20.360,00:11:22.550,连敦亲王都来替娘娘求情了,00:11:20.100,00:11:23.960,"What a rare day today!
Even State Prince Dun spoke up for Your Highness."
00:11:23.360,00:11:25.310,他这个人平时一向倨傲,,,
00:11:25.560,00:11:27.150,连皇上都不放在眼里,00:11:24.377,00:11:28.597,"He has always been a haughty man,
not even respectful towards His Majesty."
00:11:28.080,00:11:29.990,敦亲王有倨傲的本钱,00:11:29.224,00:11:31.360,He's entitled to feel superior.
00:11:31.320,00:11:32.950,他的生母温僖贵妃,,,
00:11:33.280,00:11:35.070,是孝昭仁皇后的亲妹,00:11:32.540,00:11:36.440,"His mother, Noble Consort Wenxi,
is the younger sister of Empress Xiaozhaoren,"
00:11:35.880,00:11:37.270,而当今太后,,,
00:11:37.520,00:11:40.110,曾是孝昭仁皇后的校书侍女,00:11:37.100,00:11:41.580,"while the current Empress Dowager was merely
 preceptor maid to Empress Xiaozhaoren."
00:11:40.520,00:11:41.740,当年九王夺嫡,,,
00:11:42.800,00:11:45.390,十爷所交好的八爷 九爷 十四爷,00:11:41.580,00:11:43.839,"After the battle for the throne among the nine lords,"
00:11:45.800,00:11:46.830,都遭贬斥,00:11:43.839,00:11:47.880,"although State Prince Dun's associates
Lords VIII,  IV, and XIV were banished,"
00:11:47.440,00:11:50.000,唯独他还留着亲王的爵位,00:11:48.476,00:11:50.956,he managed to retain the title of State Prince.
00:11:51.640,00:11:53.230,眼看着皇上登基,,,
00:11:53.640,00:11:55.510,他哪能咽得下这口气,00:11:52.781,00:11:56.680,"But he cannot swallow his anger
over His Majesty's rise to the throne."
00:11:56.480,00:11:57.950,那他还肯帮着娘娘,00:11:57.820,00:11:59.717,Then why would he help Your Highness?
00:11:59.680,00:12:01.750,他这哪里是帮着本宫啊,00:12:00.804,00:12:03.500,He was not helping me.
00:12:02.560,00:12:06.430,是顺水推舟卖本宫哥哥人情罢了,00:12:03.640,00:12:07.440,"He was ""pushing the boat along the current""
to earn favor from my brother."
00:12:06.640,00:12:07.470,年大将军,,,
00:12:07.760,00:12:09.470,敦亲王身份尊贵,00:12:07.440,00:12:08.880,Great General Nian?
00:12:10.560,00:12:11.700,先帝在时,,,
00:12:11.960,00:12:14.110,还曾与哥哥和十四爷共事,00:12:08.922,00:12:17.100,"Prince Dun was highly ranked among his brothers
and worked with my brother on affairs in Qinghai Province."
00:12:14.400,00:12:16.030,一起处理过青海事务,,,
00:12:16.360,00:12:17.990,算是有几分交情吧,00:12:17.280,00:12:19.180,Perhaps he did it for old times' sake.
00:12:22.520,00:12:24.710,无论啊 谁帮着娘娘都好,,,
00:12:24.960,00:12:27.420,只要娘娘重新得到皇上的宠爱,00:12:23.665,00:12:29.760,"For whatever reason, I'm happy as long as
 Your Highness regains His Majesty's favor."
00:12:27.720,00:12:28.670,奴婢就高兴,,,
00:12:31.600,00:12:32.740,衣裳都准备好了吗,00:12:32.740,00:12:34.160,Is the dress ready?
00:12:33.600,00:12:34.430,准备好了,00:12:34.200,00:12:35.640,"It is, Your Highness."
00:12:34.680,00:12:36.830,皇上最喜欢娘娘穿红色,00:12:35.640,00:12:38.060,His Majesty likes seeing Your Highness in red.
00:12:38.280,00:12:40.660,那就快点帮本宫更衣 是,00:12:39.600,00:12:42.000,"- Then hurry and help me get changed.
- Yes, Your Highness."
00:12:41.000,00:12:42.110,免得皇上等急了,00:12:42.100,00:12:43.500,I must not make His Majesty wait.
00:12:47.160,00:12:48.350,娘娘操劳了一日,,,
00:12:48.720,00:12:49.830,不如早点休息吧,00:12:48.500,00:12:51.180,"Your Majesty had a long day.
You should rest early."
00:12:51.000,00:12:53.950,这一日 真是笑得我脸都酸了,00:12:52.191,00:12:55.080,"All the smiling I put on today
has made my face sore."
00:12:54.920,00:12:58.230,这种时候啊 娘娘不想笑也得笑,00:12:56.009,00:12:59.460,"On such an occasion, Your Majesty had to
wear a smile regardless of your feelings."
00:12:58.760,00:12:59.900,真是难为娘娘了,,,
00:13:00.400,00:13:01.540,身为皇后,00:12:59.800,00:13:01.180,It must be hard on Your Majesty.
00:13:01.920,00:13:04.110,永远都不能有说厌烦的时候,00:13:01.500,00:13:05.440,But an empress must never say she's tired.
00:13:05.680,00:13:08.830,一旦被人发觉力不从心了,00:13:06.899,00:13:10.356,"If those who covet my throne ever find
my power weaker than my will,"
00:13:09.760,00:13:11.310,那些盯着后位的人,,,
00:13:11.600,00:13:13.750,不把你生吞活剥了才怪呢,00:13:10.959,00:13:14.578,"they will ""skin and eat me alive""."
00:13:14.600,00:13:15.820,娘娘说得是,00:13:15.960,00:13:17.200,Your Majesty is right.
00:13:16.720,00:13:19.430,今日瞧华妃那副小人得志的样子,00:13:17.889,00:13:21.111,Consort Fleur today... what a small woman to have gotten her way.
00:13:20.000,00:13:21.110,实在是看不上,00:13:21.111,00:13:23.111,It disgusted me.
00:13:22.000,00:13:24.630,她得不得志由皇上说了算,00:13:23.200,00:13:26.160,But she did not disgust His Majesty.
00:13:27.080,00:13:29.460,只是本宫看见温宜那孩子,,,
00:13:30.200,00:13:33.030,便想起本宫的弘晖,00:13:28.140,00:13:36.180,"Only, I couldn't help thinking of my son Honghui,
on the ceremony of his first birthday."
00:13:33.320,00:13:34.790,周岁礼时的样子,,,
00:13:36.200,00:13:37.910,大阿哥若还在的话,00:13:36.900,00:13:39.180,If the First Prince were still with us ...
00:13:38.400,00:13:39.990,弘晖若还在,00:13:39.680,00:13:41.698,"If Honghui were with us,"
00:13:40.880,00:13:43.230,一定比三阿哥长得高些,00:13:42.100,00:13:45.033,"he would have grown taller than the Third Prince,"
00:13:43.840,00:13:45.590,长得更加好看些,00:13:45.033,00:13:47.080,and more handsome.
00:13:46.040,00:13:47.630,肯定比三阿哥聪明多了,00:13:47.316,00:13:49.225,And much smarter than the Third Prince.
00:13:50.720,00:13:51.750,是啊,00:13:51.920,00:13:53.475,Indeed.
00:13:52.680,00:13:55.110,弘晖两岁时便会认字了,00:13:53.852,00:13:57.117,"Honghui began to read characters
when he was only two years old."
00:13:57.200,00:13:59.390,三阿哥根本就比不上他,00:13:58.500,00:14:00.829,The Third Prince has nothing that compares.
00:14:01.200,00:14:02.470,娘娘正当盛时,,,
00:14:03.160,00:14:04.870,肯定还能再添一位阿哥,00:14:02.400,00:14:06.040,"Your Majesty is in your prime.
You will certainly have one more prince."
00:14:06.200,00:14:08.030,本宫都年逾四十了,,,
00:14:09.000,00:14:11.270,早已不是适合孕育之身,00:14:07.500,00:14:12.540,"I'm past forty years of age,
not suitable for pregnancy anymore."
00:14:12.480,00:14:14.070,何况姐姐死后,,,
00:14:14.800,00:14:17.150,皇上再未对本宫如从前那般,00:14:13.789,00:14:18.169,"And after my sister died,
His Majesty never treated me the same way."
00:14:19.000,00:14:21.990,本宫自己的身子本宫自己知道,00:14:20.000,00:14:23.240,I know the condition of my health.
00:14:22.200,00:14:23.750,怕是再也不能了,00:14:23.240,00:14:25.113,I'm afraid I'll never be able to.
00:14:24.720,00:14:26.270,皇上虽然嘴上不说,,,
00:14:26.600,00:14:28.550,但是心里还是很尊重娘娘的,00:14:26.000,00:14:29.920,"Even though His Majesty doesn't say so,
he has a lot of respect for Your Majesty in his heart."
00:14:29.960,00:14:33.350,一个女人得不到丈夫的爱,,,
00:14:34.200,00:14:36.550,只得到尊重有什么用呢,00:14:31.100,00:14:38.160,"when a woman does not have her husband's love,
what is the use of his respect?"
00:14:39.400,00:14:41.470,你是和本宫一起过来的人,00:14:40.380,00:14:42.980,You've been through all these years with me.
00:14:42.480,00:14:43.700,皇上对本宫,,,
00:14:44.120,00:14:47.190,比之昔年对姐姐如何呀,00:14:43.604,00:14:48.500,"How do you think His Majesty has treated me
compared to how he treated my sister?"
00:14:48.000,00:14:51.540,娘娘 其实在纯元皇后未进府前,,,
00:14:52.040,00:14:54.030,皇上对娘娘您也是极好的,00:14:49.180,00:14:55.360,"Your Majesty, before Empress Première entered
the family, His Majesty treated you extremely well."
00:14:57.920,00:15:01.540,皇上对本宫再好都比不过姐姐好,00:14:59.260,00:15:02.809,"His Majesty never treated me
as well as he treated my sister."
00:15:02.720,00:15:03.910,太后也是,00:15:03.911,00:15:05.711,And the Empress Dowager too.
00:15:08.120,00:15:09.830,到底本宫是庶出,,,
00:15:10.360,00:15:11.870,不比姐姐是嫡出,00:15:09.280,00:15:13.280,"After all, I am the daughter of a secondary wife
while my sister was of a primary wife."
00:15:14.360,00:15:15.830,如果弘晖还在,,,
00:15:16.480,00:15:19.910,他便是皇上的长子 又成了嫡出,00:15:15.620,00:15:21.180,"If my son Honghui were with us,
he would have been the eldest son and of a primary wife."
00:15:20.880,00:15:22.550,身份是何等尊贵呀,00:15:21.906,00:15:24.226,What a distinguished status he would have.
00:15:29.000,00:15:30.830,弘晖死的时候,00:15:30.340,00:15:32.685,"When Honghui was dying,"
00:15:33.120,00:15:35.390,外面也是这样的雨天,00:15:34.360,00:15:37.014,it was raining just like this.
00:15:40.800,00:15:45.430,剪秋啊 本宫头好痛,00:15:42.000,00:15:43.446,"Autumn,"
,,,00:15:44.320,00:15:46.300,my migraine is piercing right now.
00:15:45.920,00:15:46.950,娘娘,00:15:46.920,00:15:48.400,Your Majesty...
00:15:51.840,00:15:52.590,娘娘,00:15:52.000,00:15:53.880,Your Majesty...

00:16:03.720,00:16:07.710,小主这两日饮食可好 还想吐否,00:16:05.000,00:16:08.940,"My Lady, how was your appetite the last two days?
Do you still feel nauseous?"
00:16:08.280,00:16:09.630,正是这个奇怪了,,,
00:16:09.880,00:16:11.510,这两日倒不想吐了,00:16:09.355,00:16:12.949,"It's strange.
I haven't felt nauseous lately."
00:16:11.960,00:16:13.830,肚子也有些微凉发痛,,,
00:16:14.240,00:16:15.460,不知是何缘故,00:16:13.213,00:16:16.660,"But my stomach aches and feels cold.
I wonder what the reason is."
00:16:16.120,00:16:18.580,安胎的方子已为小主用下,,,
00:16:18.840,00:16:20.710,小主的身体自然安逸,00:16:17.202,00:16:22.182,"My Lady, you will continue to feel at ease
as you have been taking the prenatal tonics."
00:16:21.840,00:16:24.070,至于肚痛发凉嘛,00:16:23.180,00:16:25.620,As for the stomach pain...
00:16:25.040,00:16:27.230,小主怀孕才一月有余,,,
00:16:27.440,00:16:30.030,正常正常 小主莫担心,00:16:26.164,00:16:31.620,it is normal at one month of pregnancy.
00:16:30.760,00:16:32.550,你这样说我就放心了,00:16:31.800,00:16:33.860,I feel reassured hearing you say that.
00:16:33.160,00:16:35.030,我原以为怀孕一个多月,,,
00:16:35.360,00:16:36.790,正是要害喜的时候呢,00:16:34.226,00:16:38.120,"I thought the pregnancy symptoms
would be strong in the first month."
00:16:37.600,00:16:40.030,小主身子强健 怎会被害喜,00:16:38.200,00:16:41.200,"Nay. You are in good health, My Lady.
You would not have such symptoms."
00:16:40.280,00:16:41.950,我想小主一定会为皇上,,,
00:16:42.240,00:16:44.270,生一个健健康康的小阿哥,00:16:41.300,00:16:45.380,"I believe you will give birth to a
healthy prince for His Majesty."
00:16:45.080,00:16:46.390,那就承你吉言了,,,
00:16:47.600,00:16:48.740,采月 是,00:16:46.276,00:16:47.829,I hope I fulfill your auspicious words.
00:16:49.040,00:16:50.790,把父亲托人带来的山楂糕,00:16:48.643,00:16:50.200,"- Lunar.
- Yes."
00:16:51.040,00:16:52.070,赏些给刘太医,00:16:50.200,00:16:53.300,Grant Dr. Liu some of the hawthorn cakes my father sent.
00:16:52.320,00:16:53.270,多谢小主,00:16:53.300,00:16:54.600,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:17:04.920,00:17:08.150,这山楂糕一看便知是齐顺斋所制,00:17:05.000,00:17:09.400,"The hawthorn cakes must be
made by Qishunzhai Bakery."
00:17:09.520,00:17:10.710,齐顺斋的糕点,,,
00:17:11.040,00:17:12.350,不是前年就不做了吗,00:17:10.640,00:17:13.940,Qishunzhai was closed the year before last.
00:17:13.000,00:17:15.350,刘太医是上半年才来的行宫,,,
00:17:16.000,00:17:17.110,怎么会不知道,00:17:14.091,00:17:18.460,"Dr. Liu, you were transferred to the palace this year.
Why didn't you know?"
00:17:20.280,00:17:21.420,微臣想家时,,,
00:17:21.680,00:17:23.430,总会想起齐顺斋的点心,00:17:20.960,00:17:24.720,I always think of Qishunzhai when I miss home.
00:17:23.840,00:17:25.910,所以总觉得那家店还在,00:17:24.900,00:17:27.300,It feels as if the bakery should still be there.
00:17:26.240,00:17:28.590,刚才一时口误 望小主恕罪,00:17:27.300,00:17:29.960,I apologize for my slip of the tongue.
00:17:29.080,00:17:31.070,看来你是思乡情切了,00:17:30.240,00:17:32.340,You must be missing home a lot.
00:17:32.200,00:17:33.260,你若喜欢,,,
00:17:33.520,00:17:35.750,我让采月多给你包些带回去,00:17:33.320,00:17:37.100,I will have Lunar send you more if you like.
00:17:36.000,00:17:38.070,那微臣先谢过小主,00:17:37.280,00:17:39.540,I thank My Lady in advance.
00:17:39.000,00:17:40.220,茯苓 是,00:17:40.240,00:17:41.520,"- Poria.
- Yes."
00:17:40.480,00:17:42.550,好生送刘太医出去 是,00:17:41.520,00:17:43.920,"- See Dr. Liu out.
- Yes."
00:17:42.960,00:17:44.070,刘太医 这边请,00:17:43.920,00:17:45.740,"This way please, Dr. Liu."
00:17:44.880,00:17:46.470,微臣拜谢小主,00:17:46.065,00:17:47.745,I bow to thank My Lady.
00:18:04.400,00:18:06.910,小主歇歇吧 仔细眼睛疼,00:18:05.380,00:18:08.320,"Please take a break, My Lady.
Don't strain your eyes."
00:18:14.200,00:18:16.390,快好了 还是先绣完吧,,,
00:18:16.760,00:18:17.710,小主急什么,00:18:15.460,00:18:18.000,"This one is almost done.
I will finish it."
00:18:18.360,00:18:20.150,惠贵人才一个多月的身孕,00:18:18.000,00:18:19.460,"There's no hurry, My Lady."
00:18:20.480,00:18:21.430,还有八个月,,,
00:18:21.680,00:18:23.350,才能穿上您绣的肚兜呢,00:18:19.649,00:18:24.769,"Lady Vertu is just one month into her pregnancy.
You have eight more months to finish the bib."
00:18:24.960,00:18:26.270,要把这个先绣好,,,
00:18:27.200,00:18:28.420,若眉姐姐看到了,00:18:25.740,00:18:28.000,I must finish this as soon as possible.
00:18:28.960,00:18:31.390,她要是喜欢 我再多绣几个,00:18:28.400,00:18:32.680,"If Meizhuang likes it, I will make a few more."
00:18:32.640,00:18:34.870,你不知道 孩子长得快,,,
00:18:35.320,00:18:36.540,一会儿就长大了,00:18:34.000,00:18:37.500,You have no idea how fast a baby grows.
00:18:37.080,00:18:38.830,若不多绣几个怎么行啊,00:18:37.900,00:18:40.180,They outgrow their clothes in no time.
00:18:39.480,00:18:41.990,瞧您说的 跟自己生过似的,00:18:40.400,00:18:43.335,It's not like you've had children of your own.
00:18:47.320,00:18:48.430,我在家时,,,
00:18:49.440,00:18:51.950,常看母亲给姨娘的几个孩子,00:18:48.360,00:18:54.780,"Growing up, I watched my mother
do needlework for the concubines' children."
00:18:52.320,00:18:53.460,绣这个绣那个的,,,
00:18:54.920,00:18:56.510,所以多少知道些,00:18:56.120,00:18:58.140,That is how I have the knowledge.
00:18:57.440,00:18:59.870,奴婢失言 勾起小主伤心事,00:18:58.900,00:19:01.380,"I'm sorry to have triggered
your sad memories, My Lady."
00:19:00.280,00:19:01.390,请小主责罚,,,
00:19:02.200,00:19:03.030,快起来,00:19:01.380,00:19:02.880,I will take any punishment.
00:19:04.000,00:19:05.140,我责罚你什么,00:19:03.000,00:19:04.480,Please rise.
,,,00:19:05.320,00:19:06.867,Why would I punish you?
00:19:06.640,00:19:09.710,只是不知道母亲现下如何,00:19:08.000,00:19:11.140,But I wonder how my mother has been.
00:19:10.480,00:19:13.270,小主进宫 夫人必定面上有光,00:19:11.602,00:19:14.780,"She must be so honored
that you have entered the palace."
00:19:14.080,00:19:16.030,我不过是一个不得宠的答应,00:19:15.195,00:19:17.434,I'm just a neglected Companion.
00:19:17.200,00:19:20.630,皇上连我是谁也许都不记得,00:19:18.415,00:19:22.020,His Majesty might not even remember who I am.
00:19:24.520,00:19:26.150,不到这条龙飞的时候,00:19:25.731,00:19:28.321,The dragon will have to stay where it is
00:19:28.440,00:19:29.830,它乖乖待着就是了,00:19:29.377,00:19:31.200,before having a chance to soar.
00:19:32.640,00:19:34.030,小主 不好了,00:19:33.774,00:19:35.614,"My Lady, terrible news."
00:19:35.320,00:19:35.910,怎么了,,,
00:19:36.200,00:19:37.070,安大人出事了,00:19:36.439,00:19:37.330,What happened?
,,,00:19:37.330,00:19:38.689,Mr. An had an accident.
00:19:41.480,00:19:42.230,小主,00:19:42.620,00:19:43.820,My Lady.
00:19:46.160,00:19:46.910,姐姐,,,
00:19:48.960,00:19:49.990,姐姐救命,00:19:47.660,00:19:49.140,My sisters.
00:19:50.240,00:19:51.430,陵容 这是怎么了,00:19:50.040,00:19:51.480,"My sisters, help me!"
00:19:51.680,00:19:52.510,起来 慢慢说,00:19:51.480,00:19:53.980,"- Longrong, what happened?
- Rise. Take it easy."
00:19:52.760,00:19:55.350,姐姐 我父亲下狱了,00:19:54.000,00:19:56.640,My father is in jail!
00:19:56.040,00:19:58.190,好端端的怎么会出这样的事呢,00:19:57.100,00:19:59.620,How did that happen all of a sudden?
00:19:58.680,00:19:59.820,我收到家书,,,
00:20:00.160,00:20:02.230,说松阳县令蒋文庆,00:19:59.900,00:20:01.380,I received a letter from home saying
00:20:02.640,00:20:04.230,奉旨押送西北军粮,,,
00:20:04.800,00:20:06.790,我父亲也是随军护送之一,00:20:01.380,00:20:08.000,"while my father assisted the magistrate -
Jiang Wenqing -
transferring army provisions to the Northwest,"
00:20:07.400,00:20:10.070,谁知半路遇上敌军流兵,,,
00:20:10.720,00:20:12.190,军粮被劫走了,00:20:08.700,00:20:13.480,enemy troops attacked them halfway and robbed the provisions.
00:20:12.920,00:20:14.590,蒋文庆也临阵脱逃,,,
00:20:14.920,00:20:16.550,还带走了不少银饷,00:20:14.220,00:20:17.640,Jiang Wenqing escaped and stole lots of money.
00:20:17.600,00:20:20.990,皇上龙颜震怒 随即抓回蒋文庆,,,
00:20:21.440,00:20:23.070,和父亲一起关押着,00:20:18.700,00:20:24.260,"His Majesty, shaking with rage,
decreed my father's arrest along with Jiang Wenqing."
00:20:24.000,00:20:26.380,现在生死未定,00:20:25.200,00:20:27.820,I don't know if he will live or not.
00:20:27.480,00:20:29.430,我怕皇上一怒之下,,,
00:20:29.840,00:20:32.190,爹爹性命难保,00:20:28.820,00:20:33.120,"Given such fierce anger I'm afraid His Majesty
 will sentence my father to death!"
00:20:34.440,00:20:35.420,你可问清楚了,,,
00:20:35.720,00:20:37.630,此事你父亲真未参与其中,00:20:35.700,00:20:38.860,Did you confirm your father wasn't involved at all?
00:20:37.840,00:20:40.590,不会的 父亲一向谨小慎微,00:20:38.860,00:20:40.060,I am sure!
00:20:41.000,00:20:42.350,为人只求自保,00:20:40.060,00:20:43.360,My father has always been cautious in his dealings.
00:20:42.640,00:20:44.230,是万万不敢和蒋文庆的事情,,,
00:20:44.600,00:20:45.740,掺和在一起的,00:20:43.813,00:20:47.000,He would never involve himself in what Jiang Wenqing did.
00:20:46.840,00:20:47.950,事情还未有定论,,,
00:20:48.240,00:20:49.220,你先别急着哭,00:20:48.020,00:20:50.580,"Don't cry, Lingrong.
There's no conclusion to this matter yet."
00:20:49.680,00:20:50.900,咱们想想办法要紧,,,
00:20:51.200,00:20:51.830,是啊,00:20:50.806,00:20:52.380,We must think of a solution.
,,,00:20:52.380,00:20:53.111,Exactly.
00:20:52.040,00:20:54.830,我知道 军情本是大事,00:20:53.111,00:20:57.161,"I understand that anything concerning
the military is of great consequence."
00:20:56.840,00:21:00.830,恐怕父亲凶多吉少,00:20:57.840,00:21:02.340,I'm afraid the odds are more ominous than propitious.
00:21:02.080,00:21:03.350,你家都出了这样的事,,,
00:21:03.680,00:21:05.590,咱们自然要为你去向皇上求情,00:21:03.041,00:21:06.621,We will definitely try to speak to His Majesty on your behalf.
00:21:06.360,00:21:08.230,可是朝政上的事情,,,
00:21:08.960,00:21:10.310,咱们未必插得上嘴啊,00:21:07.700,00:21:11.600,"It's just that... we are not allowed
to pass comments on state affairs."
00:21:10.680,00:21:11.470,是啊,,,
00:21:11.720,00:21:13.190,倒也不必惊动皇上,00:21:11.700,00:21:12.700,You're right.
,,,00:21:12.820,00:21:14.680,There's no need to disturb His Majesty.
00:21:13.680,00:21:16.270,这件事情眉姐姐有法子,00:21:14.780,00:21:17.660,"In fact, Meizhuang can help me."

00:21:18.480,00:21:20.990,因为这件事出在济州界上,00:21:19.380,00:21:22.320,The incident happened within the jurisdiction of Jizhou.
00:21:21.640,00:21:24.790,都由眉姐姐的父亲济州协领审问,00:21:22.697,00:21:26.253,"Your father, as the region's Commander,
will be the interrogator."
00:21:27.360,00:21:31.310,眉姐姐 求您救救父亲 你先起来,00:21:28.300,00:21:32.674,"- Meizhuang, I beg of you to help my father.

00:21:36.880,00:21:38.310,但求姐姐垂怜,00:21:35.580,00:21:37.159,I need to think ...
00:21:38.600,00:21:42.220,一封家书即可救我父亲性命,00:21:38.000,00:21:43.500,"Please have mercy on my father.
A letter from you will be enough to save his life."
00:21:42.600,00:21:43.950,好 你放心,,,
00:21:44.840,00:21:46.110,但是为求妥当,00:21:43.700,00:21:45.620,"Of course, don't worry."
00:21:46.400,00:21:48.190,我要先去见皇上探探口风,00:21:46.039,00:21:49.839,"But I must request an audience with His Majesty
and sound out his opinion."
00:21:51.040,00:21:56.990,谢谢姐姐 陵容感激不尽,00:21:52.240,00:21:54.040,"Thank you, Meizhuang!"
00:21:57.240,00:21:59.750,陵容 先别哭了,00:21:55.400,00:21:58.556,I'm eternally grateful for your help.
,,,00:22:00.000,00:22:01.560,"Lingrong, don't cry."
00:22:09.000,00:22:10.390,惠贵人,,,
00:22:10.640,00:22:12.510,您有着身孕怎么跑出来了,00:22:10.200,00:22:11.598,"Aiyo, Lady Vertu..."
00:22:12.840,00:22:14.670,小心日头晒着您哪,00:22:11.787,00:22:13.900,What brought you here carrying the child?
00:22:15.040,00:22:16.020,皇上在里头吗,00:22:14.126,00:22:16.000,Be careful not to be affected by the heat.
00:22:16.320,00:22:17.030,在,00:22:16.100,00:22:17.404,Is His Majesty inside?
00:22:17.360,00:22:18.670,可是张廷玉大人,,,
00:22:18.920,00:22:20.390,跟隆科多大人也在,00:22:17.520,00:22:20.966,"Yes, but he's with Zhang Tingyu and General Longkodo."
00:22:20.680,00:22:22.030,小主您得多等一会儿,00:22:21.760,00:22:23.340,"I'm afraid you'll have to wait for a while, My Lady."
00:22:22.280,00:22:24.430,怎么 连隆科多大人都来了,00:22:23.340,00:22:26.420,Why is General Longkodo here?
00:22:27.120,00:22:29.680,运往西北的粮草出了点事,00:22:28.100,00:22:31.000,"An accident happened to the
army provisions for the Northwest."
00:22:30.040,00:22:32.630,事关军情 皇上正在大怒呢,00:22:31.100,00:22:34.040,His Majesty is outraged about it.
00:22:33.440,00:22:35.350,可是和安答应的父亲有关,00:22:34.496,00:22:36.536,Does that involve Companion An's father?
00:22:35.600,00:22:36.950,这个奴才倒不清楚,00:22:36.800,00:22:38.536,"That, I have no idea."
00:22:38.160,00:22:40.720,只知道皇上才下了旨意,,,
00:22:41.000,00:22:43.710,为首的蒋文庆啊 斩立决,00:22:39.453,00:22:45.160,"All I know is that His Majesty has announced
the head official, Jiang Wenqing to be beheaded immediately."
00:22:44.400,00:22:46.230,那 那其他人呢,,,
00:22:46.480,00:22:47.790,这个奴才就不知道了,00:22:45.300,00:22:47.680,What ... what about the other officials?
00:22:48.480,00:22:49.110,怎么,00:22:47.700,00:22:49.600,"I don't know, My Lady."
00:22:49.880,00:22:50.750,贵人您是为了,,,
00:22:51.080,00:22:52.710,安答应的父亲求情来的,00:22:49.700,00:22:54.240,"So ... you came here for Companion An's father, My Lady?"
00:22:53.000,00:22:55.070,是 安答应伤心,,,
00:22:55.600,00:22:56.990,我不能坐视不管,00:22:54.300,00:22:57.920,"Yes, Companion An was overcome with grief.
I have to do something."
00:22:57.200,00:22:57.950,不不不,,,
00:22:58.200,00:22:59.750,依奴才看 贵人哪,00:22:58.220,00:22:59.380,No no no ...
00:23:00.000,00:23:02.590,您这个事最好是袖手旁观,00:22:59.380,00:23:03.920,"In my view, My Lady, all you can do is stand by."
00:23:03.880,00:23:05.020,还请公公赐教,00:23:04.814,00:23:06.600,"I hope you will enlighten me, sir."
00:23:08.160,00:23:11.230,皇上一向不喜欢后宫过问政事的,00:23:09.306,00:23:12.320,"His Majesty strongly disapproves of
any concubine interfering in state affairs."
00:23:11.520,00:23:13.230,尤其这是军情大事,,,
00:23:13.800,00:23:16.260,事关年羹尧西北的军情大事,00:23:12.500,00:23:17.500,"This is a great concern for the military,
especially for General Nian Gengyao."
00:23:16.520,00:23:17.500,您这一开口,,,
00:23:17.760,00:23:20.060,不等于是跟华妃过不去了吗,00:23:17.600,00:23:21.160,"If you speak for Companion An,
isn't that equivalent to offending Consort Fleur?"
00:23:20.320,00:23:22.110,可是这不是过得去过不去的事,00:23:21.160,00:23:23.540,But this is not about offending anyone.
00:23:22.720,00:23:23.830,能救人的时候,,,
00:23:24.440,00:23:26.110,我也不能眼睁睁地看着,00:23:23.766,00:23:27.380,"I cannot just stand and watch
when I can save someone's life."
00:23:26.640,00:23:28.310,这事您只能看着,00:23:27.664,00:23:29.920,I'm afraid that is what you will have to do.
00:23:29.040,00:23:29.710,您想,,,
00:23:29.960,00:23:32.390,这事不管皇上知道是不知道,00:23:30.000,00:23:33.780,Please consider:  your father will be lenient as soon as he receives a letter from you;
00:23:32.680,00:23:34.070,您这一封家书回去,,,
00:23:34.640,00:23:36.940,沈大人自然是会从轻发落,00:23:33.780,00:23:38.080,it makes no difference if His Majesty knows of your involvement or not.
00:23:37.560,00:23:40.020,可万一被人抓了这事小题大做,,,
00:23:40.560,00:23:42.070,皇上龙颜震怒,00:23:38.860,00:23:43.340,"But if someone uses your action
 in order to provoke anger in His Majesty,"
00:23:42.520,00:23:45.870,那您父亲的前程要是不要啊,00:23:43.840,00:23:47.540,wouldn't that imperil your father's post?
00:23:50.080,00:23:52.190,可是安答应的父亲,,,
00:23:52.480,00:23:53.950,要真的是被冤枉的话,00:23:51.300,00:23:54.980,But what if Companion An's father is not guilty...?
00:23:54.280,00:23:55.310,要真是冤枉的,,,
00:23:55.600,00:23:58.060,自然会给他洗雪冤枉,00:23:55.000,00:23:59.360,"If so, he will be proven innocent after investigation."
00:23:58.520,00:23:59.660,您没看见皇上,,,
00:23:59.920,00:24:02.070,方才为这事发多大的脾气呢,00:23:59.500,00:24:03.380,You didn't see how furious His Majesty was just now.
00:24:02.520,00:24:05.470,您犯不着拿着您的荣宠去犯险哪,00:24:03.719,00:24:07.119,It's not worthwhile to risk His Majesty's favor for this matter.
00:24:06.600,00:24:09.350,再说 您现下正怀着龙裔,,,
00:24:09.600,00:24:11.470,眼看着就要协理六宫了,00:24:07.774,00:24:12.594,"Also, you are now with child and in sight of
the power to assist in palace management,"
00:24:11.760,00:24:14.220,犯不着去蹚这摊浑水呀,00:24:12.820,00:24:15.780,why would you wade into this muddy water?
00:24:14.840,00:24:17.300,再说 您这一开口劝,,,
00:24:17.720,00:24:19.510,华妃娘娘那儿知道了,00:24:15.900,00:24:20.500,"And if Her Highness Consort Fleur
hears about your pleading,"
00:24:20.040,00:24:23.070,安答应的父亲非死不可了,00:24:21.217,00:24:24.536,Companion An's father will definitely die.
00:24:26.320,00:24:27.150,那,00:24:27.500,00:24:28.563,Then ...
00:24:34.240,00:24:36.590,请公公不要和皇上说我来过了,,,
00:24:36.840,00:24:37.710,是,00:24:35.000,00:24:38.600,"- Sir, please don't tell His Majesty that I came.
- Yes."
00:24:38.080,00:24:40.350,外头热 小主 您赶快回去吧,00:24:38.700,00:24:41.720,"It is hot out here.
Please go quickly, My Lady."
00:24:50.200,00:24:51.230,你先别伤心,,,
00:24:52.320,00:24:53.540,咱们想想别的法子,00:24:51.339,00:24:55.379,Don't be sad. We'll think of another way.
00:24:55.280,00:24:56.470,还有什么法子,,,
00:24:57.800,00:24:59.310,眉姐姐都不能救,00:24:56.200,00:24:58.220,What other way?
00:25:00.360,00:25:02.230,旁人就更没办法了,00:24:58.980,00:25:00.960,Even Meizhuang wasn't able to do anything about it.
00:25:02.760,00:25:03.870,眉姐姐的话在理,00:25:01.500,00:25:03.580,No one else would be able to.
00:25:04.760,00:25:05.820,她若一开口,00:25:03.882,00:25:05.882,What Meizhuang said is reasonable.
00:25:06.360,00:25:08.920,这华妃就更要置你父亲于死地了,00:25:06.000,00:25:10.220,"If she speaks up for you, Consort Fleur
will spare no effort to put your father to death."
00:25:10.520,00:25:12.150,那我还能怎么办,00:25:11.546,00:25:13.646,But what else can I do?
00:25:12.720,00:25:18.390,皇上今天已经下令蒋文庆斩立决,00:25:13.956,00:25:19.636,"His Majesty has announced the
immediate execution of Jiang Wenqing today."
00:25:20.320,00:25:24.190,明日可能就是我父亲了,00:25:21.439,00:25:22.901,Tomorrow ...
,,,00:25:23.343,00:25:26.022,it could be my father.
00:25:27.920,00:25:29.270,咱们去求求皇后吧,00:25:29.295,00:25:31.071,Let's go see the Empress.
00:25:31.400,00:25:32.150,皇后,00:25:32.602,00:25:33.602,The Empress ...
00:25:38.560,00:25:39.950,给两位小主请安,,,
00:25:40.720,00:25:41.830,烦请通报皇后,00:25:39.700,00:25:41.400,Peace to My Ladies.
00:25:42.080,00:25:43.750,我与安小主想面见皇后,00:25:41.900,00:25:45.080,"May I trouble you to inform Her Majesty
that Companion An and I request an audience?"
00:25:44.120,00:25:45.630,两位小主来得真是不巧,,,
00:25:46.080,00:25:47.060,娘娘出去了,00:25:45.200,00:25:46.880,"You've come at an inopportune time, My Ladies."
00:25:47.480,00:25:48.310,我记得这个时候,00:25:47.000,00:25:48.360,Her Majesty is not here.
00:25:48.680,00:25:50.190,娘娘应该午睡才起啊,00:25:48.626,00:25:51.566,"If I recall correctly, this is the time Her Majesty rises from her afternoon nap."
00:25:50.720,00:25:53.150,娘娘去勤政殿见皇上了,00:25:51.840,00:25:54.400,"Her Majesty went to see His Majesty
 at the Governance Hall."
00:25:53.840,00:25:55.390,两位小主暑天赶来,,,
00:25:55.840,00:25:57.350,想必是为了同一件事,00:25:55.026,00:25:59.147,"My Ladies, I believe Her Majesty and you have
endured today's scorching heat for the same reason."
00:25:58.800,00:26:00.510,皇后娘娘好快的消息,,,
00:26:00.880,00:26:02.750,算准了我和姐姐要来求她,00:26:00.020,00:26:01.860,Her Majesty is resourceful.
00:26:03.040,00:26:04.070,就先去见皇上了,00:26:02.124,00:26:05.544,"She anticipated our request and
 went to see His Majesty first."
00:26:04.600,00:26:06.670,娘娘此去不知何时才能回来,00:26:05.741,00:26:08.020,It is uncertain when Her Majesty will be back.
00:26:07.120,00:26:09.030,要不先到偏殿等候吧,00:26:08.226,00:26:10.340,Would you mind waiting in the side chamber?
00:26:09.560,00:26:11.270,茶水都已经备下了,,,
00:26:11.520,00:26:12.550,那就有劳剪秋姑姑了,00:26:10.500,00:26:12.540,Tea has been prepared.
00:26:13.120,00:26:13.710,请,00:26:12.540,00:26:14.180,"Thank you, Madam Autumn."
,,,00:26:14.400,00:26:15.318,Please.
00:26:18.240,00:26:19.710,皇后去了勤政殿,00:26:19.500,00:26:21.180,The Empress went to the Governance Hall?
00:26:22.400,00:26:25.750,大中午的她上那儿去干什么,00:26:23.720,00:26:27.109,"What for, in the midday heat?"
00:26:26.720,00:26:29.830,听说皇后娘娘是为安答应的父亲,,,
00:26:30.200,00:26:31.260,安比槐求情,00:26:28.220,00:26:32.680,"I learned that Her Majesty was pleading
in favor of An Bihuai, Companion An's father."
00:26:33.840,00:26:34.750,你是说,,,
00:26:35.120,00:26:37.580,安比槐运送军粮不力的事,00:26:35.000,00:26:38.880,"You mean, the official who failed to escort the army provisions?"
00:26:38.600,00:26:40.110,娘娘的兄长年将军,,,
00:26:40.360,00:26:41.420,在外辛苦征战,00:26:39.620,00:26:42.940,"Your Highness's brother, General Nian,
is fighting valiantly on the frontier"
00:26:41.840,00:26:43.830,可后方却连这区区小事,,,
00:26:44.160,00:26:45.030,都办不妥当,00:26:43.204,00:26:46.285,"while they couldn't do such
a small thing for him at the back end."
00:26:45.640,00:26:47.350,难怪皇上要生气,00:26:46.734,00:26:48.654,No wonder His Majesty was enraged.
00:26:48.760,00:26:49.870,只是,00:26:50.220,00:26:51.540,Only ...
00:26:50.800,00:26:53.790,皇后娘娘刚去找了一个好人情,,,
00:26:54.480,00:26:56.510,娘娘是否也要走一趟,00:26:52.000,00:26:58.000,"Is Your Highness going to pay a visit as well
now that the Empress has done Companion An a favor?"
00:26:59.280,00:27:02.430,安答应跟莞贵人惠贵人很亲近吧,00:27:00.502,00:27:03.560,Isn't Companion An very close to Lady Sourire and Lady Vertu?
00:27:03.040,00:27:04.390,情同姐妹,00:27:04.200,00:27:05.660,They are like sisters.
00:27:06.480,00:27:08.910,后宫中哪来的什么情同姐妹,00:27:07.640,00:27:10.360,No one can be like sisters in the harem.
00:27:09.640,00:27:11.590,不过是势弱依附势强,,,
00:27:12.040,00:27:13.470,愚笨听从聪明,00:27:11.000,00:27:14.900,"It's just the weak being reliant on the strong,
and the unintelligent obedient to the wise."
00:27:14.560,00:27:17.470,今日是姐妹 明日是仇敌,00:27:15.980,00:27:18.923,Sisters of today will become tomorrow's nemeses.
00:27:18.480,00:27:21.790,面前是笑脸 背后就是刀子,00:27:19.413,00:27:23.180,A smile on the face is only to hide a dagger in the back.
00:27:24.040,00:27:25.470,娘娘一针见血,00:27:25.056,00:27:27.764,"Your Highness's sharp words ""draw blood with one needle."""
00:27:28.640,00:27:31.830,你以为治理后宫是和气安抚好,,,
00:27:32.560,00:27:34.190,还是铁腕之治好,00:27:29.580,00:27:35.460,"Do you prefer the harem to be managed
with a velvet glove or an iron fist?"
00:27:36.680,00:27:39.430,嫔妾愚钝 实在不知这些,00:27:37.753,00:27:40.576,My dull-witted mind knows nothing of such things.
00:27:41.440,00:27:44.390,女人多的地方是非多,00:27:42.758,00:27:45.618,Conflicts occur wherever women gather.
00:27:45.720,00:27:50.230,耍心眼掉眼泪 扮笑脸说是非,00:27:46.940,00:27:51.700,"They cry with scheming tears
and smile despite a spiteful mind."
00:27:51.600,00:27:53.550,表面上一池静水,,,
00:27:54.400,00:27:56.310,底下却暗潮汹涌,00:27:52.859,00:27:57.760,"The harem appears as a pond of still water,
but beneath the surface, turbulent currents surge."
00:27:58.480,00:28:00.350,换做是本宫治理,,,
00:28:01.000,00:28:03.230,必定铁腕铁拳铁石心肠,00:27:59.840,00:28:04.320,"Were I to govern the harem,
I would rule with an iron fist and iron heart."
00:28:04.480,00:28:08.150,重刑之下还有谁敢罔顾法纪,00:28:05.761,00:28:10.000,"I dare anyone to ignore law and discipline
under the threat of severe punishment."
00:28:09.480,00:28:10.750,娘娘说得是,00:28:10.704,00:28:12.387,Your Highness is absolutely right.
00:28:12.920,00:28:15.350,皇后娘娘回宫,00:28:14.216,00:28:16.656,Her Majesty the Empress returns.
00:28:22.480,00:28:24.510,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:28:23.700,00:28:26.140,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:28:25.280,00:28:26.190,都起来吧,,,
00:28:26.400,00:28:27.070,是,00:28:26.300,00:28:27.700,All rise.
00:28:31.960,00:28:32.870,赐座,,,
00:28:33.320,00:28:34.430,谢皇后娘娘,00:28:33.061,00:28:34.141,Have a seat.
,,,00:28:34.480,00:28:35.880,I thank Your Majesty.
00:28:37.080,00:28:41.790,安答应父亲的事本宫已经尽力了,00:28:38.278,00:28:42.758,I did all I could to help Companion An's father.
00:28:42.040,00:28:43.260,可是也没办法,00:28:43.060,00:28:44.600,But it isn't up to me.
00:28:44.000,00:28:46.950,皇上他只说事关朝政,,,
00:28:47.240,00:28:48.510,再不言其他,00:28:45.302,00:28:50.002,His Majesty only said that it was a matter in court.
00:28:49.640,00:28:53.830,娘娘既如此说 那臣妾也无法了,00:28:50.794,00:28:54.954,"If Your Majesty says so ...
That is all I can do as well."
00:28:55.560,00:28:56.870,事到如今,,,
00:28:57.560,00:29:00.120,一是要看你父亲的运数,00:28:56.613,00:29:01.480,"At this point, we can only count on Heaven's blessings,"
00:29:00.640,00:29:04.110,二是要慢慢再看皇上那里,,,
00:29:04.360,00:29:06.030,是否还有商量的余地,00:29:01.800,00:29:07.440,and whether His Majesty will be open to further discussion.
00:29:11.640,00:29:14.270,陵容多谢皇后娘娘关怀体恤,00:29:13.000,00:29:15.760,"Lingrong is most grateful for
Your Majesty's help and consideration."
00:29:14.920,00:29:17.430,必当铭记恩德,00:29:16.137,00:29:19.157,I will always remember Your Majesty's benevolence.
00:29:18.680,00:29:19.430,起来吧,,,
00:29:20.680,00:29:21.390,是,00:29:20.000,00:29:21.161,You may rise.
00:29:21.640,00:29:23.430,谁都有命途不济的时候,00:29:22.600,00:29:25.060,Misfortune can befall anyone.
00:29:25.600,00:29:27.390,本宫身为后宫之主,,,
00:29:28.200,00:29:30.910,也与你们同是侍奉皇上的姐妹,00:29:25.764,00:29:32.200,"I am not only the head of the harem,
but also a sister to all of you in the family."
00:29:31.320,00:29:32.950,能帮你们一把的时候,,,
00:29:33.240,00:29:35.070,自然是要帮你们一把的,00:29:32.700,00:29:36.340,I must help you whenever my ability allows.
00:29:38.040,00:29:39.710,无论此事能否得偿所愿,,,
00:29:40.280,00:29:41.230,皇后娘娘此言,,,
00:29:41.640,00:29:43.590,臣妾们实在感激不尽,00:29:39.500,00:29:45.060,"No matter how things turn out,
we are eternally grateful for Your Majesty's words."
00:29:45.280,00:29:46.670,臣妾自入深宫,,,
00:29:47.320,00:29:49.310,多见华妃威势冷眼,00:29:46.500,00:29:50.820,"Ever since I entered the palace, I have been intimidated
by Consort Fleur's cold and domineering eyes."
00:29:50.120,00:29:53.740,皇后娘娘母仪天下 垂爱后宫,00:29:51.302,00:29:55.360,"Your Majesty is a caring, motherly presence
to the harem and the whole nation."
00:29:55.440,00:29:56.470,臣妾,00:29:56.726,00:29:57.980,I ...
00:29:58.160,00:30:00.230,莞贵人 你一向懂事,,,
00:30:00.920,00:30:03.350,这件事要好好安慰安答应,00:29:59.321,00:30:05.261,"Lady Sourire, you are a sensible person.
You must offer some comfort to Companion An."
00:30:03.560,00:30:04.350,明白吗,,,
00:30:04.800,00:30:07.510,娘娘如此关怀 臣妾感同身受,00:30:06.120,00:30:09.180,"I share the same gratitude as Companion An
for Your Majesty's care and support."
00:30:08.560,00:30:10.790,不知要如何才能回报皇后恩泽,00:30:09.790,00:30:12.690,How may we possibly repay Your Majesty's favor?
00:30:13.360,00:30:15.030,后宫风波频起,,,
00:30:15.560,00:30:18.390,本宫身子不好 实在疲于应付了,00:30:14.500,00:30:19.800,"There is one trouble after another in the harem,
but my health limits my energy to manage it all."
00:30:19.600,00:30:21.310,莞贵人善解人意,,,
00:30:21.560,00:30:23.750,如能知本宫心之所向,,,
00:30:24.320,00:30:27.070,自然能为本宫分劳解忧,00:30:20.800,00:30:28.460,"With a perceptive mind like yours, Lady Sourire,
you can ease some of my worries, if you know what they are."
00:30:37.080,00:30:38.670,这样热的天气,00:30:37.000,00:30:38.400,"Aiya,"
00:30:39.120,00:30:42.230,这香炉里的死灰重又复燃了,00:30:38.480,00:30:43.460,"on such a hot day, the ash in the censer
could flame back up."
00:30:42.560,00:30:43.950,可怎么好啊,00:30:43.686,00:30:45.646,What should we do about it?
00:31:05.520,00:31:07.150,臣妾等身处后宫之中,,,
00:31:07.560,00:31:09.070,仰仗的是皇后的恩泽,00:31:06.980,00:31:10.200,"It is by the grace of Your Majesty
that we can have a peaceful life in the palace."
00:31:09.560,00:31:11.190,能为皇后娘娘分忧解劳,,,
00:31:11.600,00:31:13.070,是臣妾等分内之事,00:31:10.660,00:31:14.460,We therefore must share Your Majesty's burdens.
00:31:13.680,00:31:15.750,俗话说智者劳心,00:31:14.826,00:31:17.342,"""While the wise exercises their mind,""

00:31:16.240,00:31:18.830,臣妾卑微 只能以劳力以报皇后,00:31:17.342,00:31:20.441,"will take the necessary actions
to return Your Majesty's kindness."
00:31:19.960,00:31:24.190,好啊 真的没有让本宫失望,00:31:21.100,00:31:25.100,"Very well, you did not let me down."

finally able to rest upon a branch."""
00:31:35.160,00:31:36.990,其实这后宫里头啊,00:31:34.000,00:31:36.000,[Duan Ge Xing by Cao Cao]
00:31:37.240,00:31:39.310,从来就只有一棵树,00:31:36.460,00:31:40.440,"In sooth, there is only one tree in the harem."
00:31:39.960,00:31:42.870,只是乱花渐欲迷人眼罢了,00:31:41.180,00:31:44.000,But the bright-colored flowers may deceive your eyes.
00:31:43.400,00:31:44.590,只要你看得清,,,
00:31:44.960,00:31:48.950,哪棵是树哪朵是花就好了,00:31:44.500,00:31:50.260,All is well as long as you can distinguish the tree from the flowers.
00:31:49.280,00:31:51.870,多谢皇后娘娘指点 臣妾谨记,00:31:50.449,00:31:53.689,"I thank Your Majesty.
I will always remember your advice."
00:31:58.000,00:32:00.590,皇后去见皇上为安比槐求情的事,,,
00:32:00.840,00:32:02.230,华妃娘娘已经知道了,00:31:59.520,00:32:04.240,"Consort Fleur is aware that the Empress
has seen His Majesty for An Bihuai's case."
00:32:04.000,00:32:05.430,此时没有比华妃娘娘,,,
00:32:05.760,00:32:07.230,更关心皇后娘娘的人了,00:32:05.200,00:32:08.920,"Right now, no one is more concerned about
Her Majesty than Consort Fleur."
00:32:08.440,00:32:10.790,你猜猜华妃现在在做什么,00:32:09.615,00:32:13.120,Take a guess what Consort Fleur is doing.
00:32:12.120,00:32:14.710,想必是与皇后反其道而行之,00:32:13.200,00:32:16.220,"Presumably, she is doing
the opposite of what Her Majesty did -"
00:32:15.200,00:32:17.580,想请皇上从严处置安比槐吧,00:32:16.720,00:32:19.460,pleading with His Majesty to punish An Bihuai severely.
00:32:18.440,00:32:19.790,如此可要多谢她了,00:32:19.500,00:32:21.860,We must thank her if that's the case.
00:32:22.120,00:32:23.510,小主何出此言,,,
00:32:24.600,00:32:25.950,多谢她如此卖力,00:32:23.206,00:32:25.180,"How so, My Lady?"
00:32:26.560,00:32:29.630,如此一来 我可省心多了,00:32:25.804,00:32:32.064,"We must thank her for putting in so much effort,
which will save us a lot of trouble."
00:33:08.760,00:33:11.550,何时来的 朕竟没有发觉,00:33:10.000,00:33:13.480,When did you come in? I wasn't even aware.
00:33:12.840,00:33:15.350,四郎好睡 嬛嬛不忍惊动,00:33:14.002,00:33:16.820,"Si Lang, you were soundly asleep.
I didn't have the heart to disturb you."
00:33:15.920,00:33:17.470,案牍劳形啊,00:33:17.000,00:33:19.045,The memorandums are never exhausted before I am.
00:33:18.160,00:33:20.620,不知不觉看了一天摺子了,00:33:19.460,00:33:23.100,"Before I know it, I have spent the entire day reading."
00:33:22.320,00:33:24.350,那些老头子有事没事,,,
00:33:24.640,00:33:27.150,写一个摺子来啰嗦 烦人哪,00:33:23.402,00:33:28.800,"Those old fogeys never miss a day -
writing to bother me, even over nothing."
00:33:27.760,00:33:29.510,身为言官职责如此,,,
00:33:29.840,00:33:31.270,四郎不必苛责他们,00:33:29.089,00:33:32.665,"It is their duty as the officials.
Si Lang need not be too tough on them."
00:33:33.000,00:33:36.390,何况时有美人来探四郎,,,
00:33:37.000,00:33:39.560,慇勤缠绵 何来案牍之苦呢,00:33:34.300,00:33:41.180,"And with the affectionate ladies visiting to keep you company,
they must have made your work more enjoyable."
00:33:40.800,00:33:44.870,大约是红袖添香 诗情画意吧,00:33:42.028,00:33:47.188,"It must have been a poetic scene where a
""fragrant red cuff perfumed each turned page."""
00:33:49.680,00:33:50.430,好香,00:33:50.718,00:33:52.198,"Hmm, it smells really good."
00:33:51.400,00:33:55.230,妮子越发刁滑了 是朕太过纵你,00:33:52.720,00:33:57.380,"I've humored your cheeky tongue.
You've grown even brasher."
00:33:57.640,00:33:59.990,嬛嬛本就不如华妃娘娘善体君心,00:33:58.800,00:34:02.321,"Compared to Her Highness Consort Fleur,
Huan Huan barely understands Your Majesty."
00:34:01.640,00:34:03.110,只会惹四郎生气,00:34:03.000,00:34:05.236,All I do is upset Si Lang.
00:34:11.640,00:34:13.870,你怎么知道是华妃来过了,00:34:13.060,00:34:15.640,How did you know Consort Fleur was here?
00:34:17.240,00:34:19.670,扇子上的香味是天宫巧,00:34:18.340,00:34:21.345,"The fan is scented with ""Celestial Palace,"""
00:34:20.480,00:34:23.550,这种胭脂甜香扑鼻 制作不易,00:34:21.900,00:34:25.400,"a rare rouge that is intricately crafted
 with a captivating fragrance."
00:34:24.520,00:34:26.470,宫中能用的妃嫔并无几人,00:34:25.900,00:34:28.040,It's granted to very few in the palace.
00:34:27.880,00:34:29.430,皇后娘娘素不喜香,,,
00:34:30.280,00:34:32.580,想来华妃娘娘来见皇上时,00:34:29.180,00:34:31.600,"Her Majesty eschews perfume,"
00:34:33.040,00:34:34.390,必定是精心妆扮,00:34:31.760,00:34:36.060,"so it must be Her Highness who came
elegantly dressed to see Your Majesty."
00:34:35.120,00:34:38.510,所以连扇子上都沾染了胭脂香味,00:34:36.326,00:34:39.832,And the scent of her rouge lingers on the fan.
00:34:40.280,00:34:42.070,你倒是见微知著啊,,,
00:34:42.640,00:34:43.860,四郎且说是不是,00:34:41.476,00:34:43.536,"You can ""discern a great truth from a small phenomenon."""
00:34:44.920,00:34:46.030,什么都瞒不过你,00:34:43.980,00:34:45.640,"Si Lang, just tell me if I'm right."
,,,00:34:46.064,00:34:47.537,Your nose sees everything.
00:34:48.040,00:34:51.030,皇后前脚刚走 华妃就来了,00:34:49.260,00:34:52.620,Consort Fleur set her foot in when the Empress had just left.
00:34:51.880,00:34:53.020,都是为了同一个人,,,
00:34:54.360,00:34:55.750,可是为了安答应的父亲,00:34:53.000,00:34:54.836,They came here for the same person.
00:34:56.120,00:34:57.030,安比槐一事,00:34:55.539,00:34:58.740,"Was it for Companion's father, An Bihuai?"
00:34:57.760,00:34:58.430,正是,00:34:58.900,00:35:00.000,Exactly.
00:34:59.520,00:35:02.910,那么你呢 你又是为何,00:35:00.800,00:35:04.372,"What about you?
What brought you here?"
00:35:04.320,00:35:05.990,让嬛嬛来猜上一猜,00:35:05.600,00:35:07.482,Let Huan Huan take a guess.
00:35:07.160,00:35:08.510,皇后娘娘仁善,,,
00:35:09.240,00:35:11.190,必定是为安答应求情的,00:35:08.620,00:35:12.434,"Her Majesty is kind-hearted.
She must be pleading for Companion An."
00:35:11.880,00:35:13.430,华妃娘娘刚直不阿,,,
00:35:14.160,00:35:16.230,想必是要四郎执法严明,00:35:13.089,00:35:19.100,"Her Highness has a just mind.
She must be in favor of impersonal law enforcement."
00:35:16.600,00:35:17.510,不徇私情,,,
00:35:18.360,00:35:19.190,那么你呢,00:35:19.220,00:35:20.541,What about you?
00:35:19.480,00:35:22.150,后宫不得干政 嬛嬛铭记于心,00:35:20.711,00:35:23.911,"The harem must not interfere in state affairs.
Huan Huan always bears that in mind."
00:35:23.320,00:35:24.430,嬛嬛只是奇怪,,,
00:35:25.080,00:35:26.670,皇后娘娘与华妃娘娘,,,
00:35:26.920,00:35:28.750,同为安比槐一事面见皇上,00:35:24.464,00:35:30.200,"I'm just curious, since Her Majesty and Her Highness
had opposing views on the same issue,"
00:35:29.480,00:35:31.550,不知真的是两位娘娘意见相左,,,
00:35:32.160,00:35:33.220,还是这件事情,,,
00:35:33.520,00:35:35.150,本就值得再细细推敲,00:35:30.704,00:35:36.600,"does that mean their opinions can be reconciled
and the case is worth further examination?"
00:35:36.240,00:35:37.190,什么推敲,00:35:37.215,00:35:38.917,What do you mean?
00:35:43.440,00:35:44.660,臣妾幼时观史,,,
00:35:45.120,00:35:47.310,见圣主明君责罚臣民时,,,
00:35:47.680,00:35:50.270,往往责其首而宽其从 恩威并济,00:35:44.700,00:35:51.800,"From my reading of history, the illustrious emperors
tended to punish the primary culprit while showing mercy to the dependents."
00:35:50.760,00:35:53.470,使臣民敬畏之外更感激天恩浩荡,00:35:51.900,00:35:55.160,"This would inspire in the people
not only reverence but also gratitude."
00:35:54.240,00:35:56.670,皇上一向仰慕唐宗宋祖风范,00:35:55.502,00:35:58.060,"As an admirer of the founding emperors
of the Tang and Song Dynasties,"
00:35:57.280,00:35:58.910,皇上亦是明君仁主,00:35:58.437,00:36:00.957,Your Majesty is a sagacious and benevolent emperor as well.
00:36:00.320,00:36:01.460,臣妾愚昧,,,
00:36:02.000,00:36:04.230,认为外有战事 内有刑狱,00:36:01.302,00:36:03.000,"In my humble opinion,"
00:36:04.720,00:36:06.750,二者清则社稷明,00:36:03.226,00:36:08.366,"the reign is bright when outward wars
and inward penalties are clear."
00:36:08.960,00:36:12.150,朕一向只知你饱读诗书,00:36:10.264,00:36:14.504,"I have known you are well-versed in literature,"
00:36:13.840,00:36:16.220,不想史书国策亦通,00:36:15.000,00:36:18.123,but you are also proficient in history and national tactics.
00:36:17.840,00:36:23.030,句句不涉朝政却句句以史明政,00:36:19.300,00:36:25.020,"You inform governance in light of history
without direct reference to the state affairs."
00:36:24.200,00:36:25.390,有卿如此,,,
00:36:25.960,00:36:27.470,朕如得至宝,00:36:25.364,00:36:28.946,"I'm grateful to have your assistance,
as if adding a jewel to my crown."
00:36:29.800,00:36:33.030,安比槐一事朕会派人重新明查,,,
00:36:33.440,00:36:34.790,必不使一人含冤,00:36:31.260,00:36:36.474,"I will have An Bihuai's case re-investigated.
No innocent should be unjustly convicted."
00:36:36.600,00:36:37.790,臣妾一介女流,,,
00:36:38.600,00:36:39.990,在皇上面前放肆,,,
00:36:40.360,00:36:41.990,还请皇上勿要见怪才好,00:36:37.920,00:36:43.700,"I hope Your Majesty will pardon
my brazen violation of the rules for women."
00:36:42.600,00:36:44.110,后宫不得干政,,,
00:36:45.120,00:36:47.550,若朕单独与你在一起,00:36:43.900,00:36:46.100,"While the harem cannot interfere in the court,"
00:36:48.360,00:36:49.790,朕便是你的夫君,00:36:46.389,00:36:51.279,"I am your husband, not your monarch,
when you are alone with me."
00:36:51.080,00:36:52.510,妻子在夫君面前,,,
00:36:52.840,00:36:54.990,畅所欲言 谈史论政,00:36:52.580,00:36:56.680,"From history to political views, you can speak
freely of anything with your husband."
00:36:56.120,00:36:56.950,有何不可,00:36:56.700,00:36:58.800,There's nothing wrong with that.
00:36:58.040,00:36:58.990,臣妾不敢,00:36:59.206,00:37:00.414,I dare not.
00:36:59.280,00:37:03.350,莞贵人甄氏不敢 甄环无妨,00:37:00.414,00:37:04.733,"Noble Lady Sourire doesn't dare to,
but Zhen Huan can."
00:37:10.040,00:37:14.150,是 嬛嬛在皇上面前不敢僭越,00:37:10.923,00:37:15.592,"Yes, I dare not overstep my bounds before Your Majesty,"
00:37:15.200,00:37:18.230,可是对四郎必定知无不言,00:37:16.573,00:37:20.160,but Huan Huan will talk her heart out to Si Lang.
00:37:27.200,00:37:29.110,奴婢给小主道喜了,,,
00:37:29.800,00:37:31.710,姑姑客气了 怎么,00:37:28.302,00:37:30.820,I'm here to congratulate My Lady!
00:37:32.040,00:37:34.420,今儿一早皇上命济州协领沈自山,00:37:31.000,00:37:33.140,"Thank you, Madam. What happened?"
00:37:34.680,00:37:37.140,重审安大人牵涉运送军粮一案,00:37:33.200,00:37:38.500,"Early this morning, His Majesty ordered Shen Zishan,
the Commander of Jizhou to re-investigate your father's case."
00:37:37.400,00:37:38.670,安大人活命有望了,00:37:38.640,00:37:40.515,We are hopeful that he will be spared.
00:37:40.760,00:37:41.350,真的,,,
00:37:41.640,00:37:42.350,当然了,00:37:41.962,00:37:43.040,Really?
00:37:42.920,00:37:43.900,昨儿个皇后娘娘,00:37:43.040,00:37:44.080,Of course.
00:37:44.320,00:37:45.380,亲自去向皇上求情,,,
00:37:45.960,00:37:47.950,皇上自然会给娘娘面子,00:37:44.120,00:37:49.000,"The Empress pleaded for the case yesterday, and
His Majesty must give face to Her Majesty."
00:37:48.920,00:37:50.190,多谢皇后娘娘,00:37:50.000,00:37:51.461,I thank Her Majesty.
00:37:50.440,00:37:53.310,别 小主还是等安大人无恙时,,,
00:37:53.640,00:37:55.350,再亲自去向娘娘道谢吧,00:37:52.226,00:37:56.920,"Not now, My Lady. You should thank Her Majesty
in person when all is well with your father."
00:37:56.400,00:37:58.310,昨儿个好像莞贵人,,,
00:37:58.680,00:37:59.740,也去向皇上求情了,00:37:57.420,00:38:01.198,It seems that Lady Sourire went to see His Majesty as well.
00:38:00.440,00:38:03.110,说来小主与莞贵人 还有惠贵人,,,
00:38:03.480,00:38:04.510,真是情同姐妹啊,00:38:01.640,00:38:05.960,"Lady Vertu and Lady Sourire are like sisters to you, My Lady!"
00:38:05.280,00:38:07.630,甄姐姐倒真是真心真意待我,00:38:06.514,00:38:09.474,Sourire does treat me wholeheartedly
00:38:08.800,00:38:10.020,只是眉姐姐她,00:38:10.000,00:38:11.396,while Meizhuang ...
00:38:10.600,00:38:13.190,沈贵人已经给沈大人修书一封,,,
00:38:13.560,00:38:15.030,让他多多关照此事,00:38:11.861,00:38:16.148,"Lady Vertu has sent a letter to Mr. Shen
to take care of the matter."
00:38:15.680,00:38:19.190,顺水推舟的人情谁不会做,00:38:16.700,00:38:20.654,"Anyone can give a push to the boat
when it's already carried by the current."
00:38:19.920,00:38:22.030,其实有皇后去求情,,,
00:38:22.600,00:38:24.670,皇上是一定会宽恕安大人的,00:38:20.900,00:38:26.040,"In fact, His Majesty was certainly going to
pardon Mr. An as the Empress spoke for you."
00:38:25.160,00:38:28.700,若是沈贵人肯早些写信给沈大人,,,
00:38:29.440,00:38:31.270,小主也不会这般担心了,00:38:26.300,00:38:32.434,"If only Lady Vertu had sent the letter sooner,
you wouldn't have to worry so much, My Lady."
00:38:33.800,00:38:35.990,奴婢还有差事 就先告辞了,00:38:34.677,00:38:37.600,"I have some errands to run.
Please allow me to take my leave, My Lady."
00:38:36.560,00:38:37.540,姑姑慢走,00:38:37.700,00:38:39.092,"Take care, Madam."
00:38:52.560,00:38:54.670,宝鹃 宝鹃,00:38:54.000,00:38:55.907,Coua...
00:38:55.160,00:38:57.790,对了 你快去找些值钱的东西来,00:38:56.436,00:38:59.376,"Quickly, collect some valuable jewelry of mine."
00:38:58.360,00:38:59.710,父亲经了这番折腾,,,
00:39:00.280,00:39:01.310,家里上上下下,,,
00:39:01.680,00:39:03.310,肯定动了不少银钱关系,00:38:59.640,00:39:04.758,My family must have spent a lot of money to buy favors from others.
00:39:04.240,00:39:05.350,我若不帮衬着,,,
00:39:05.920,00:39:07.910,母亲在家的日子肯定也难过,00:39:05.600,00:39:09.376,"My mother must be having a hard time
at home if I don't help her."
00:39:08.840,00:39:10.060,母亲眼睛不好,,,
00:39:10.640,00:39:12.670,平日里就受几个姨娘的欺负,00:39:10.161,00:39:14.361,"She suffers from poor eyesight, and
my father's concubines often bully her."
00:39:14.400,00:39:16.070,要不是萧姨娘护着,,,
00:39:17.400,00:39:18.670,还不知道要怎样,00:39:15.600,00:39:20.238,"Were if not for my aunt's help,
I can't imagine how much worse it would be for her."
00:39:19.480,00:39:20.700,还好莞贵人素日,,,
00:39:21.040,00:39:22.430,送与小主的东西不少,00:39:20.600,00:39:23.916,It's fortunate that Lady Sourire has sent you many gifts.
00:39:22.800,00:39:25.470,小主可以拣些好的送回府里就是,00:39:24.105,00:39:26.897,"You can select some items and send them home, My Lady."
00:39:25.920,00:39:27.470,再好的东西又能怎么样,,,
00:39:28.640,00:39:29.750,我算是知道了,00:39:27.300,00:39:29.338,What is the use of even the finest jewelry?
00:39:30.120,00:39:33.470,谁的话都没有皇后娘娘的话管用,00:39:29.800,00:39:34.832,"I have finally learned that no one
carries more weight than the Empress."
00:39:34.160,00:39:34.950,那是自然,,,
00:39:35.240,00:39:36.110,除了太后,,,
00:39:36.360,00:39:38.660,皇后娘娘可是宫里最大的女人了,00:39:35.360,00:39:40.400,"Of course, the Empress is the most important woman
in the palace other than the Empress Dowager."
00:39:39.480,00:39:40.590,出了这样的事,,,
00:39:41.200,00:39:44.980,我才知道什么都是靠不住的,00:39:40.520,00:39:46.431,Now I know I can never count on anyone else.
00:39:45.920,00:39:48.300,眉姐姐平日里与我姐妹相称,00:39:46.926,00:39:49.834,"Meizhuang addresses me as her sister,"
00:39:48.800,00:39:52.750,有事相求 便唯恐避之不及,00:39:49.834,00:39:53.920,"but in a crisis, stays away from me like a plague."
00:39:53.480,00:39:54.540,奴婢倒觉得,,,
00:39:55.000,00:39:57.230,莞贵人倒是对小主真心,00:39:54.500,00:39:58.560,"My Lady, I feel that Lady Sourire is sincere to you."
00:39:58.840,00:40:01.400,谁对我好 我心里有数,00:39:59.800,00:40:02.897,I know in my heart who is good to me.
00:40:02.000,00:40:05.190,奴婢觉得靠旁人不如靠自己,00:40:03.236,00:40:06.576,"My Lady, I think you should rely on
yourself rather than anyone else."
00:40:05.840,00:40:08.030,小主想为大人和夫人争气,,,
00:40:08.480,00:40:09.790,不如自己得宠,,,
00:40:10.080,00:40:12.150,扬眉吐气来得更痛快,00:40:07.120,00:40:13.800,"You can gain favor for yourself to ""smooth
your furrowed eyebrows"" and make your parents proud."
00:40:13.080,00:40:17.430,我既没那个本事 也没那个机会,00:40:14.026,00:40:19.053,"I'm incapable of that, and devoid of a chance to do so."
00:40:18.040,00:40:21.150,小主有心就好 有心就有机会,00:40:19.327,00:40:22.527,"As long as you have the heart, My Lady,
there will be a way."
00:40:35.720,00:40:36.550,小主怕热,,,
00:40:36.840,00:40:38.270,你怎么不在里面给小主扇扇子,00:40:37.000,00:40:39.551,"Why are you not fanning My Lady inside
when it's so hot right now?"
00:40:38.680,00:40:39.430,皇上在呢,,,
00:40:39.680,00:40:40.710,我怎么敢在里面待呀,,,
00:40:41.400,00:40:43.070,这些蝉闹得小主睡不好,00:40:39.740,00:40:42.229,His Majesty is here. I don't dare to stay in.
00:40:43.400,00:40:44.910,我出来粘走这些小东西,00:40:42.400,00:40:46.460,"I'm using a sticky pole to catch the cicadas
so My Lady can have better sleep."
00:40:46.000,00:40:47.220,光粘这里有什么用,,,
00:40:47.560,00:40:48.990,外面的院子里多得是呢,00:40:46.864,00:40:48.540,Only catching the cicadas on this tree?
00:40:49.360,00:40:50.500,要一并粘去才安静,00:40:48.540,00:40:51.980,"There are many more trees in the outer yard.
It won't be quiet until you catch them all."
00:40:51.800,00:40:52.910,你不陪我一起呀,,,
00:40:54.040,00:40:55.630,小主让我摘了几朵荷花,00:40:52.226,00:40:54.533,"Hey, aren't you going to do it with me!"
00:40:55.920,00:40:57.310,说午觉睡醒以后要看的,00:40:55.226,00:40:58.620,"My Lady sent me to collect some lotus flowers
so she could see them after her nap."
00:40:57.680,00:40:58.590,我去找个瓶子插上,00:40:58.620,00:41:00.140,I'm going to put them in a vase.
00:41:07.360,00:41:08.190,皇上饶恕,,,
00:41:08.440,00:41:09.580,奴婢不知皇上在这里,00:41:08.274,00:41:11.149,"I beg Your Majesty's pardon.
I didn't know Your Majesty was here."
00:41:10.000,00:41:10.980,实是无心之失啊,00:41:11.149,00:41:12.659,I didn't mean to interrupt.
00:41:12.200,00:41:14.430,小主 浣碧不是有意的,00:41:13.300,00:41:16.140,"My Lady, I didn't mean to."
00:41:17.000,00:41:20.230,你就是那个爱穿绿衫子的浣碧,00:41:18.000,00:41:21.580,You must be the Jade who likes to wear jade.
00:41:21.160,00:41:23.540,奴婢正是 皇上好记性,00:41:22.400,00:41:24.960,"Yes, Your Majesty has a good memory."
00:41:27.840,00:41:29.190,放下东西 下去吧,00:41:28.880,00:41:30.805,You may leave after you put away the flowers.
00:41:29.960,00:41:30.630,是,00:41:31.220,00:41:32.161,Yes.
00:41:48.680,00:41:51.110,为何要把荷花放在宽口瓶里,00:41:50.060,00:41:52.390,Why did you put the flowers in a big bowl?
00:41:52.240,00:41:53.070,回皇上,,,
00:41:53.600,00:41:56.060,奴婢心想 要是花浮在瓶里,00:41:53.640,00:41:58.737,"Your Majesty, I was hoping to keep them floating
in the bowl the same way they're blooming on the lake."
00:41:56.400,00:41:57.460,就好比开在水上,,,
00:41:57.880,00:41:59.070,会更加好看一些,00:41:58.737,00:42:00.737,They will look more beautiful.
00:42:01.400,00:42:03.990,你长得俏丽 心思也细巧,00:42:02.240,00:42:05.558,You have a pretty face and an even more beautiful mind.
00:42:04.800,00:42:05.590,谢皇上,00:42:05.860,00:42:07.480,I thank Your Majesty.
00:42:15.040,00:42:16.790,果然是你调教出来的人,00:42:16.126,00:42:18.108,Even your maid takes after you.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;

A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
