00:02:26.080,00:02:28.030,姜忠敏做事倒是极利落,,,
00:02:28.920,00:02:30.830,才一会儿工夫就打点到家了,00:02:27.420,00:02:32.360,"Jiang Zhongmin is very competent.
Everything has been well-placed in a blink."
00:02:31.800,00:02:33.950,小主昨夜向皇上表明情由了吗,00:02:32.700,00:02:35.560,"My Lady, did you vindicate yourself last night?"
00:02:34.440,00:02:36.350,皇上不会再以为您和眉庄小主,,,
00:02:36.680,00:02:38.230,假怀孕的事有牵连了吧,00:02:35.560,00:02:39.920,"I hope His Majesty no longer believes you were
involved in Meizhuang's feigned pregnancy."
00:02:40.000,00:02:42.560,皇上信与不信全在他一念之间,,,
00:02:43.560,00:02:45.630,我只需做好我分内之事也就罢了,00:02:41.300,00:02:44.960,I cannot predict what thoughts cross His Majesty's mind.
00:02:46.400,00:02:47.510,何必惹他不痛快呢,00:02:44.960,00:02:49.500,"I simply did what I was supposed to do.
I would never wish to get into his bad graces."
00:02:48.840,00:02:49.430,奴才明白了,,,
00:02:50.000,00:02:51.270,就是因为皇上痛快了,,,
00:02:51.720,00:02:52.390,所以才会在意,,,
00:02:52.720,00:02:54.110,是不是有人让小主不痛快,00:02:49.700,00:02:55.580,"I see. When you are in His Majesty's good graces
My Lady, he cares who is disturbing you."
00:02:54.480,00:02:55.390,惩处了黄规全,,,
00:02:56.640,00:02:57.990,那皇上现在应该对小主,00:02:55.580,00:02:57.500,That's why he punished Huang Guiquan.
00:02:58.360,00:02:59.310,半分疑心也没了吧,00:02:57.880,00:03:01.040,"His Majesty must have resolved all his doubts in you, My Lady."
00:03:00.640,00:03:01.430,应该吧,00:03:01.400,00:03:03.440,I hope so.
00:03:04.240,00:03:05.710,只要皇上信小主就好,00:03:05.000,00:03:07.500,"As long as His Majesty trusts you, My Lady."
00:03:14.000,00:03:17.390,皇上 内务府的姜忠敏来了,00:03:15.220,00:03:19.260,"Your Majesty, Jiang Zhongmin from
the Household Department is here."
00:03:17.960,00:03:18.670,叫他进来吧,00:03:19.260,00:03:21.000,Show him in.
00:03:25.560,00:03:26.350,启禀皇上,,,
00:03:27.280,00:03:29.390,波斯国今年进贡螺子黛三斛,00:03:26.860,00:03:30.800,"Your Majesty, only three boxes of
Persian Brow Ink were offered as tribute this year."
00:03:30.040,00:03:31.790,不比往年有二十斛之数,,,
00:03:32.360,00:03:33.790,可以顾及宫中妃嫔,00:03:30.800,00:03:35.740,"Unlike the past years when twenty boxes were offered,
it is insufficient to provide for all the concubines."
00:03:34.320,00:03:35.460,奴才请皇上的旨,,,
00:03:36.200,00:03:38.830,这三斛螺子黛该如何分数,00:03:35.740,00:03:40.760,"I hope Your Majesty can enlighten my dull-witted mind
as to how we will distribute the three boxes."
00:03:40.400,00:03:42.310,这样的小事也来问朕,00:03:41.000,00:03:44.040,Why do you have to ask me over such a trivial matter?
00:03:43.080,00:03:44.140,僧多粥少,,,
00:03:44.640,00:03:45.950,未免嫔妃争执,,,
00:03:46.480,00:03:48.150,皇上的赏赐是最佳的,00:03:44.280,00:03:50.480,"When there is ""too little congee for all the monks"",
Your Majesty's reward will prevent conflicts among the concubines."
00:03:50.400,00:03:53.350,你虽是新官上任 倒是也乖觉,00:03:51.600,00:03:55.260,You have an agile mind for your new job.
00:03:55.360,00:03:59.110,皇后贵为中宫 不能少了她那份,00:03:56.600,00:04:01.540,"The Empress will have one box
as the distinguished head of the harem."
00:04:00.240,00:04:03.270,莞贵人画远山黛最好看,,,
00:04:04.360,00:04:05.270,也便给她,00:04:01.540,00:04:07.020,"Lady Sourire is gorgeous when she draws
her eyebrows as ""distant mountains"". She'll have one."
00:04:05.840,00:04:06.710,再者,,,
00:04:08.920,00:04:11.670,臣妾自信眉不画而黑,00:04:07.020,00:04:09.500,As for the third box ...
00:04:12.600,00:04:14.900,皇上无需考虑臣妾,00:04:10.100,00:04:16.800,"I like my eyebrows without using ink pens.
Your Majesty need not think of me."
00:04:15.760,00:04:19.990,华妃最爱长眉入鬓 便给她吧,00:04:17.300,00:04:22.300,"Consort Fleur likes to draw her eyebrows
long into the temples. I'll give it to her."
00:04:21.080,00:04:24.030,其余的妃嫔若无螺子黛,,,
00:04:24.440,00:04:25.350,用铜黛即可,00:04:22.460,00:04:27.300,The other concubines may use Bronze Ink.
00:04:25.920,00:04:26.590,嗻,,,
00:04:33.160,00:04:36.910,其实朕应该赏你一斛螺子黛,00:04:34.500,00:04:38.900,You deserve my reward of a box of Persian Ink
00:04:37.640,00:04:41.340,谢你告诉朕沈氏饭菜有毒一事,,,
00:04:41.800,00:04:43.470,免了后宫一场风波,00:04:38.900,00:04:45.720,"to thank you for telling me that Shen was
almost poisoned and preventing disorder in the harem."
00:04:45.160,00:04:48.780,皇上说过 听了便忘了,00:04:45.720,00:04:50.880,Your Majesty agreed to not commit it to your memory.
00:04:49.560,00:04:52.020,何苦还要谢臣妾呢,00:04:50.880,00:04:54.940,What is there to thank me for?
00:05:08.640,00:05:10.940,娘娘 今年的螺子黛到了,00:05:09.680,00:05:13.580,"Your Highness, here is the Persian Ink of this year."
00:05:16.360,00:05:17.990,往年给本宫的螺子黛,,,
00:05:18.320,00:05:19.590,都有三斛之数,,,
00:05:20.360,00:05:22.070,怎么今年就只有这些,00:05:17.580,00:05:23.660,"I have always received three boxes of Persian Ink.
Why is there only one box for this year?"
00:05:22.840,00:05:24.190,内务府的人说,,,
00:05:24.520,00:05:27.030,今年波斯国出产螺子黛甚少,00:05:23.800,00:05:30.160,"The Household Department said that only three boxes
were offered as tribute this year due to low production."
00:05:27.320,00:05:28.670,一共只得三斛,,,
00:05:29.040,00:05:30.150,那还有两斛呢,00:05:30.160,00:05:32.300,What about the other two boxes?
00:05:31.680,00:05:32.950,一斛赏了皇后,00:05:32.900,00:05:34.540,"One was rewarded to the Empress,"
00:05:35.040,00:05:36.390,一斛赏了莞贵人,00:05:35.500,00:05:38.500,and the other for Lady Sourire.
00:05:38.160,00:05:39.380,又是甄嬛这个贱人,,,
00:05:40.240,00:05:42.310,昨夜偏生狐媚迷惑了皇上去,00:05:39.500,00:05:41.360,Zhen Huan! That bitch again!
00:05:43.320,00:05:44.350,以致本宫今日,00:05:41.360,00:05:44.500,What a minx to have seduced His Majesty away last night
00:05:44.640,00:05:46.430,被齐妃这个贱贱婢耻笑,00:05:44.500,00:05:48.500,holding me up to ridicule by that wretch Astuce!
00:05:47.240,00:05:49.310,今日又来分本宫的螺子黛,00:05:48.500,00:05:51.980,And now she dares to take away my Persion Ink!
00:05:51.760,00:05:53.310,皇后便也罢了,,,
00:05:54.080,00:05:56.110,少不得要给她三分颜面,00:05:52.760,00:05:58.000,The Empress was rewarded as a matter of formality.
00:05:56.760,00:05:58.190,她甄嬛又是什么东西,,,
00:05:58.680,00:06:00.790,娘娘息怒 免伤凤体啊,00:05:58.140,00:05:59.800,Zhen Huan is nothing!
00:06:01.720,00:06:03.590,娘娘生气又有何用,00:05:59.800,00:06:02.500,"May peace be restored in Your Highness
for the good of Your Highness' health."
00:06:03.960,00:06:05.310,不如从长计议,00:06:02.600,00:06:06.780,"Your Highness, we can develop a plan rather than a rage."
00:06:05.720,00:06:06.860,从长计议,,,
00:06:07.240,00:06:09.950,嫔妾定当设法为娘娘筹谋,00:06:06.780,00:06:08.460,What is the plan?
00:06:10.360,00:06:11.420,免娘娘烦恼,00:06:08.500,00:06:13.040,I will think of a plan to allay the worries of Your Highness.
00:06:11.880,00:06:13.670,甄嬛只是个小小贵人,,,
00:06:14.120,00:06:16.500,就能连消带打地除了黄规全,00:06:13.040,00:06:20.620,"A mere Noble Lady was able to take down Huang Guangquan.
What is there for you to plan now?"
00:06:17.080,00:06:18.750,哪还容得你从长计议,,,
00:06:19.240,00:06:21.470,你费尽心思只除了一个沈眉庄,,,
00:06:22.160,00:06:23.950,甄嬛的地位毫无动摇,00:06:20.620,00:06:27.480,"It took your best efforts to get rid of Shen Meizhuang.
Zhen Huan was not only unaffected but is rising."
00:06:24.320,00:06:25.460,反而蒸蒸日上,,,
00:06:26.840,00:06:28.990,本宫倒不敢信你了,00:06:27.480,00:06:30.400,I would not risk placing confidence in you.
00:06:30.200,00:06:31.110,娘娘明鉴,,,
00:06:31.440,00:06:34.030,自从嫔妾进宫便深得娘娘厚爱,,,
00:06:34.640,00:06:35.990,嫔妾并无二心,00:06:31.000,00:06:37.980,"Your Highness has eyes like mirrors that see my loyalty
for the good graces Your Highness bestowed on me."
00:06:36.720,00:06:38.230,这个本宫自然知道,,,
00:06:38.800,00:06:40.510,否则还有你的容身之地吗,00:06:37.980,00:06:40.040,That I know.
00:06:45.160,00:06:47.750,本宫好容易才重得皇上欢心,00:06:40.040,00:06:43.000,Otherwise you wouldn't have a place in the palace.
00:06:49.200,00:06:51.150,断不能再被贱人所害,00:06:46.360,00:06:54.300,"It was not easy to regain His Majesty's favor.
I am not to be harmed by a wretch."
00:06:57.640,00:07:00.510,妹妹今日怎么没带公主来玩,00:06:59.000,00:07:02.800,"Qinmo, why did you not come with the princess?"
00:07:01.760,00:07:03.550,公主只在皇上那儿玩吗,,,
00:07:04.760,00:07:06.710,公主夜来身体不适,00:07:02.800,00:07:05.840,Does she only visit His Majesty?
00:07:07.320,00:07:09.350,除了午后去皇上那里,00:07:06.000,00:07:08.700,Wenyi hasn't been sleeping well lately.
00:07:09.800,00:07:11.390,这两日并未出门,00:07:08.700,00:07:13.460,"She hasn't been outside for two days
except visiting His Majesty in the afternoon."
00:07:12.960,00:07:14.630,你虽是她的亲娘,,,
00:07:15.080,00:07:16.990,但也只是个小小的贵人,00:07:13.460,00:07:18.780,It is an exception for you as a mere Noble Lady to be allowed to raise the Imperial Heir.
00:07:18.840,00:07:20.110,公主有恙,,,
00:07:20.520,00:07:22.390,在你宫里养着也不方便,00:07:19.540,00:07:23.960,It is also inconvenient to take care of her in your chamber.
00:07:22.760,00:07:23.390,娘娘,,,
00:07:23.680,00:07:25.710,还是把她送到本宫这儿养病吧,00:07:23.960,00:07:24.960,You Highness...
00:07:26.520,00:07:29.110,娘娘 公主半夜啼哭,00:07:24.960,00:07:27.220,She'll have a speedy recovery living in my palace.
00:07:29.440,00:07:30.910,实在打扰娘娘休息,00:07:27.720,00:07:32.280,"Your Highness, Wenyi cries at night
and will really disturb your sleep."
00:07:31.480,00:07:32.750,娘娘若是喜欢,,,
00:07:33.080,00:07:35.430,嫔妾可随时带她过来,00:07:32.300,00:07:36.620,I can bring her here anytime as Your Highness pleases.
00:07:35.760,00:07:37.350,还不快把公主抱来,,,
00:07:38.160,00:07:39.140,把奶娘留下,00:07:36.700,00:07:41.020,"Bring the princess here.
Her nursemaid will stay here as well."
00:07:40.360,00:07:41.070,是,00:07:41.020,00:07:43.000,Yes.
00:07:46.520,00:07:51.540,怎么 怕本宫害了公主吗,00:07:47.500,00:07:53.040,What's wrong? Are you afraid that I would harm the princess?
00:07:52.920,00:07:53.980,嫔妾不敢,,,
00:07:54.880,00:07:56.230,嫔妾只是觉得,00:07:53.040,00:07:56.260,I dare not think that way.
00:07:56.720,00:08:00.340,娘娘如此厚爱公主 心中感激,00:07:56.260,00:08:01.760,"I am immensely grateful that ...
Your Highness adores and cares for Wenyi."
00:08:00.760,00:08:01.670,那就好,00:08:01.760,00:08:03.700,Very well.
00:08:04.080,00:08:07.190,你要记得 若无本宫,,,
00:08:07.520,00:08:09.980,公主一出生就只能养在阿哥所,00:08:05.460,00:08:11.580,"You must remember that the princess would
have been kept in the Imperial nursery if it were not for me."
00:08:10.800,00:08:12.670,哪能由你这样日日照顾,00:08:11.580,00:08:13.940,You would not have been able to live with her.
00:08:12.960,00:08:13.630,是,,,
00:08:13.920,00:08:15.140,公主在本宫这儿,00:08:13.940,00:08:15.100,Yes.
00:08:16.000,00:08:17.310,你也得空不少,00:08:15.100,00:08:19.200,"When she's in my care, you will have enough time"
00:08:18.160,00:08:19.220,就好好想想,,,
00:08:20.040,00:08:22.110,该如何帮本宫解除烦恼吧,00:08:19.200,00:08:24.060,to think about what you can do for me.
00:08:23.120,00:08:23.950,嫔妾明白,00:08:24.060,00:08:26.080,"I understand, Your Highness."
00:08:34.840,00:08:36.150,这两日夜里有点凉,,,
00:08:37.600,00:08:39.430,也不知眉姐姐的衣裳够不够穿,00:08:36.280,00:08:42.000,"It is rather cold at night.
I wonder if Meizhuang is well provided for."
00:08:41.520,00:08:44.390,所谓天凉衣上身 礼薄情意暖,00:08:42.600,00:08:46.560,A garment on a cold day is a simple gift but warm.
00:08:45.160,00:08:46.910,眉姐姐若是收到这件衣衫,,,
00:08:47.560,00:08:48.750,必定会暖上心头的,00:08:46.560,00:08:50.960,Meizhuang will be warmed to her heart when she receives it.
00:08:51.040,00:08:51.910,若是再添上,,,
00:08:52.160,00:08:53.590,你这双巧手所绣的花样,,,
00:08:54.360,00:08:55.580,更是锦上添花了,00:08:50.960,00:08:58.480,Your delicate embroidery will bring it to perfection.
00:09:00.120,00:09:00.790,小主,,,
00:09:01.080,00:09:02.750,刚才内务府送来了一斛螺子黛,,,
00:09:03.120,00:09:04.150,说是皇上赏的,00:09:01.200,00:09:05.920,"My Lady, the Household Department brought you
a box of Persian Ink that His Majesty rewarded."
00:09:04.560,00:09:06.510,让小主画远山黛最好看,,,
00:09:07.400,00:09:08.190,你放下吧,00:09:05.920,00:09:08.720,"His Majesty likes your eyebrows drawn as ""distant mountains""."
00:09:08.720,00:09:09.780,小主去试试吧,00:09:08.720,00:09:10.080,Place it over there.
00:09:10.200,00:09:11.990,这螺子黛可珍贵得很哪,00:09:10.080,00:09:13.860,"My Lady, you may want to try some.
It is a very precious gift."
00:09:15.280,00:09:17.230,听说螺子黛价值千金,,,
00:09:17.560,00:09:18.390,若不是贡品的,,,
00:09:18.680,00:09:19.660,我连见都没见过呢,00:09:16.820,00:09:21.340,"I heard that the Persian Ink is worth thousands of taels.
It is my first time seeing it."
00:09:20.320,00:09:21.750,姐姐随姑姑去试试吧,,,
00:09:22.120,00:09:23.100,这里有我就成了,00:09:21.340,00:09:25.580,"Sourire, you should try it on.
I'll take care of the embroidery."
00:09:35.280,00:09:36.750,小主托付芳若姑姑的事,,,
00:09:37.080,00:09:37.910,已经全办好了,00:09:36.180,00:09:40.100,Madam Orchid fulfilled what you requested of her.
00:09:41.320,00:09:42.710,这个是眉庄小主,,,
00:09:43.000,00:09:44.430,让芳若姑姑送出来的,,,
00:09:45.120,00:09:46.510,务必要交到小主手中,00:09:42.500,00:09:49.040,"She also brought a note from Meizhuang
that must be handed to you, My Lady."
00:09:49.480,00:09:51.940,珍重自身 扶持陵容,00:09:50.560,00:09:54.240,Take care of yourself and aid Lingrong.
00:09:55.080,00:09:56.590,眉姐姐处境这样艰难,,,
00:09:57.120,00:09:58.590,还想着要替我周全,00:09:56.000,00:10:00.660,Meizhuang is still considerate of me despite her difficult situation.
00:10:00.960,00:10:02.270,眉庄小主说得对,,,
00:10:03.160,00:10:05.150,眼下小主身边可以依靠的人,00:10:01.500,00:10:04.300,"My Lady, she is right."
00:10:06.000,00:10:07.670,也只有安小主一人了,00:10:04.300,00:10:10.300,Companion An is the only one you can rely on at the moment.
00:10:28.000,00:10:31.310,颂芝 这太阳这么大,,,
00:10:31.640,00:10:33.150,怎么不给公主打把伞啊,00:10:29.440,00:10:34.800,"Song Zhi, why are you not using the parasol for the princess?"
00:10:33.520,00:10:34.470,这不是打伞了吗,,,
00:10:35.720,00:10:37.590,可公主还是有些晒到了,00:10:34.800,00:10:36.820,I am.
00:10:38.200,00:10:40.030,一点点而已 很快就到了,00:10:36.820,00:10:39.180,But she has still been exposed to the sun.
00:10:40.280,00:10:42.310,颂芝 公主她年幼体弱,00:10:39.180,00:10:41.500,Just a little bit. We'll be indoors shortly.
00:10:42.600,00:10:44.350,奴婢知道公主年幼体弱,00:10:41.500,00:10:43.560,"Song Zhi, the princess is young and delicate..."
00:10:44.800,00:10:47.360,如今公主福气大 得娘娘照顾,00:10:43.560,00:10:46.020,I know that.
00:10:48.560,00:10:50.310,贵人该感恩戴德才是,00:10:46.020,00:10:49.320,But she's very blessed to be taken care of by Her Highness.
00:10:50.800,00:10:52.150,怎么还挑三拣四呢,00:10:49.320,00:10:54.000,"My Lady, why do you seem unthankful
for Her Highness's good grace?"
00:10:53.040,00:10:54.230,颂芝姑娘多心了,,,
00:10:54.720,00:10:56.230,咱们公主有娘娘疼爱,00:10:54.000,00:10:55.920,"It's not like that, Madam."
00:10:56.520,00:10:58.030,贵人高兴还高兴不过来呢,00:10:55.920,00:10:59.720,"My Lady is more than happy that Her Highness
would like to take care of the princess."
00:10:58.800,00:11:01.870,只是当娘的难免心疼孩子,00:10:59.800,00:11:04.660,My Lady was just showing her motherly care ...
00:11:02.320,00:11:02.870,多嘱咐一句,,,
00:11:03.120,00:11:05.310,好了 娘娘还在等着咱们呢,,,
00:11:05.680,00:11:06.430,赶紧走吧,00:11:04.660,00:11:06.820,"All right, Her Highness is waiting for us."
,,,00:11:06.820,00:11:08.380,Let's go quickly.
00:11:10.760,00:11:14.030,小主 咱们争不过华妃娘娘,00:11:11.840,00:11:16.500,"My Lady, we cannot show defiance to Her Highness."
00:11:16.160,00:11:18.460,我一直对她言听计从,,,
00:11:19.000,00:11:20.310,为她出谋划策,00:11:17.480,00:11:21.800,I've always been obedient to her and contributed to her efforts.
00:11:20.640,00:11:22.350,她却连孩子都不留给我,00:11:21.800,00:11:24.700,But now she's taking away my daughter!
00:11:24.200,00:11:28.150,这种寄人篱下 身不由己的日子,00:11:25.340,00:11:30.680,I've been living under her eaves and by her command.
00:11:29.440,00:11:31.820,什么时候才能到头啊,00:11:30.680,00:11:33.400,When will this end?
00:11:32.120,00:11:32.990,小主别伤心,,,
00:11:33.960,00:11:36.520,说不定华妃娘娘养几天便烦了,00:11:33.400,00:11:35.260,"Don't worry, My Lady ..."
00:11:37.280,00:11:38.550,一定会还给小主的,00:11:35.400,00:11:40.440,"Her Highness might become disinterested in her
after a few days and return her to your care."
00:11:39.280,00:11:40.150,会吗,00:11:40.440,00:11:41.700,Will she?
00:12:00.120,00:12:01.260,这孩子日日哭 夜夜哭,,,
00:12:01.640,00:12:02.550,本宫还怎么睡,,,
00:12:03.320,00:12:04.070,娘娘息怒,00:12:01.500,00:12:04.540,"She cries all day and all night.
How am I supposed to sleep?"
00:12:05.400,00:12:06.350,去把奶娘叫来,00:12:04.540,00:12:06.000,May peace be restored in Your Highness.
00:12:06.880,00:12:08.390,我倒要看看她们怎么哄公主的,00:12:06.320,00:12:10.340,"Bring the nursemaids here.
I need to know how they pacify her."
00:12:08.920,00:12:09.550,是,00:12:10.340,00:12:11.740,Yes.
00:12:19.560,00:12:20.700,不哭啊,,,
00:12:23.160,00:12:24.790,你们两个是怎么带公主的,00:12:21.300,00:12:22.820,Don't cry.
00:12:26.680,00:12:28.150,公主这样夜夜啼哭,00:12:24.200,00:12:27.000,How are the two of you taking care of her?
00:12:28.760,00:12:29.900,本宫都不得安枕,00:12:28.140,00:12:32.000,I cannot sleep at all when she keeps crying.
00:12:31.160,00:12:32.950,奴婢已经想尽办法哄了,,,
00:12:33.440,00:12:34.950,可能公主乍离了生母,00:12:32.080,00:12:34.440,"Your Highness, we've tried everything."
00:12:35.280,00:12:37.030,换了宫苑 还不适应,00:12:34.440,00:12:38.340,"The princess might need more time to get used to
an unfamiliar chamber since her mother is away."
00:12:37.240,00:12:38.630,所以惊扰了娘娘安睡,,,
00:12:39.320,00:12:41.230,果真想尽法子都没用吗,00:12:38.340,00:12:40.440,Sorry to have disturbed Your Highness.
00:12:41.680,00:12:42.510,奴婢无能,00:12:40.460,00:12:42.700,Did you really do everything you can?
00:12:45.040,00:12:46.180,把公主抱过来,00:12:42.700,00:12:44.700,I'm sorry for my incompetence.
00:12:46.560,00:12:47.230,是,00:12:45.920,00:12:49.280,"- Bring me the princess.
- Yes."
00:12:59.160,00:13:02.470,温宜乖 温宜不哭,00:12:58.400,00:13:04.820,"Oh, Wenyi, good girl, don't cry."
00:13:06.520,00:13:07.910,这孩子可真难哄,,,
00:13:08.640,00:13:09.230,颂芝,00:13:07.460,00:13:09.920,She's a lot of work.
00:13:09.480,00:13:09.950,是,,,
00:13:10.280,00:13:12.150,把太医给本宫开的安神药拿来,00:13:09.920,00:13:11.300,"- Song Zhi.
- Yes."
00:13:12.600,00:13:13.510,再端碗温水,00:13:11.300,00:13:15.000,"Bring my teapills for sleep, and a bowl of warm water."
00:13:14.160,00:13:14.790,是,00:13:15.080,00:13:16.500,Yes.
00:13:31.560,00:13:32.390,你倒是快点啊,00:13:32.500,00:13:34.620,Faster!
00:13:40.080,00:13:40.710,娘娘,00:13:41.300,00:13:42.700,Your Highness.
00:13:44.600,00:13:47.590,来 温宜乖 喝一口,00:13:46.000,00:13:49.200,"Here, good girl, have a spoon."
00:13:47.960,00:13:49.670,娘娘 公主年幼,,,
00:13:50.000,00:13:51.830,那药怕是吃不得呀,00:13:49.300,00:13:53.960,"Your Highness, I'm afraid the princess
is too young to be taking such medicine."
00:13:52.760,00:13:55.710,本宫能吃得 她为何吃不得,00:13:53.960,00:13:57.780,Why? The medicine works fine on me.
00:13:58.520,00:14:00.030,你们要敢说出去半个字,,,
00:14:00.600,00:14:02.150,本宫就要了你们的脑袋,00:13:59.760,00:14:01.980,"If you dare say a word about it,"
00:14:02.800,00:14:03.630,奴婢知道,00:14:01.980,00:14:03.960,I will have your heads off.
00:14:04.200,00:14:05.030,还不快抱走,00:14:03.960,00:14:05.300,We understand.
00:14:05.960,00:14:06.550,快,00:14:05.460,00:14:06.740,Now take her away.
00:14:09.680,00:14:10.350,来,00:14:07.240,00:14:08.840,Quickly.
00:14:12.800,00:14:13.710,不哭啊,00:14:11.140,00:14:12.800,(yawning)
00:14:14.920,00:14:17.550,以后公主再闹 就用这个法子,00:14:14.060,00:14:15.620,Don't cry.
00:14:19.080,00:14:19.990,是 娘娘,00:14:16.120,00:14:19.840,Now you know what to do if she keeps crying at night.
00:14:20.240,00:14:21.030,是 娘娘,00:14:20.340,00:14:23.420,"- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness."
00:14:29.960,00:14:31.230,贵人有所不知,,,
00:14:31.520,00:14:32.580,若皇上来时,,,
00:14:32.920,00:14:35.380,华妃娘娘便对公主十分疼爱,00:14:30.840,00:14:37.440,"My Lady, Her Highness shows great care for
the princess only when His Majesty visits."
00:14:36.160,00:14:39.030,若皇上不在 便对公主淡淡的,00:14:37.440,00:14:40.900,But Her Highness ignores her needs otherwise.
00:14:39.600,00:14:41.030,奴婢们身为乳母,,,
00:14:41.240,00:14:42.590,饮食中皆不能放盐,,,
00:14:42.920,00:14:44.060,才能出好奶水,00:14:41.000,00:14:45.560,"As nursemaids, we must have
low-sodium diets to produce good milk."
00:14:45.160,00:14:46.910,可华妃不放在心上,,,
00:14:47.240,00:14:49.190,其他的人就更不放在心上了,00:14:45.600,00:14:50.980,"But no one keeps this in mind
since Her Highness pays no attention to us."
00:14:50.000,00:14:50.980,这也就罢了,,,
00:14:51.400,00:14:52.590,奴婢奶水不好,,,
00:14:52.880,00:14:54.150,公主又吃不习惯,00:14:51.200,00:14:57.360,"To make things worse, the princess did not like
our milk and kept crying at night."
00:14:54.480,00:14:55.750,夜里总是啼哭,,,
00:14:56.520,00:14:59.630,可华妃娘娘竟将安神药喂给公主,00:14:57.400,00:15:01.260,Her Highness made the princess consume sedatives.
00:15:00.320,00:15:02.670,公主小小的年纪就吃这些药,,,
00:15:03.040,00:15:04.310,只怕是伤身哪,00:15:01.300,00:15:06.000,"I'm afraid it will damage her health
to take such medicine at this age."
00:15:09.160,00:15:11.150,我又能怎么办呢,00:15:10.340,00:15:13.600,But what can I do?
00:15:13.280,00:15:16.390,每次我去 她都不常让我见公主,00:15:14.640,00:15:18.460,She rarely allowed me to see Wenyi when I visited.
00:15:17.320,00:15:19.470,凡事多问上两句便生气,,,
00:15:20.040,00:15:21.550,说我不放心她,00:15:18.600,00:15:23.420,"And she took offence if I asked about Wenyi,
saying that I should trust her."
00:15:22.920,00:15:25.950,此事若不是你来告诉我,,,
00:15:27.240,00:15:29.670,只怕我真要被蒙在鼓里,00:15:24.020,00:15:31.200,I wouldn't know any of this if you didn't come to tell me.
00:15:30.160,00:15:31.750,还请贵人多想想办法,,,
00:15:32.120,00:15:33.630,早点接公主回来吧,00:15:31.480,00:15:35.060,"My Lady, please think of a way to take back the princess."
00:15:34.200,00:15:36.350,我何尝不是千盼万盼,00:15:35.300,00:15:38.480,How much I want that!
00:15:38.280,00:15:39.990,只是她现在正得意,,,
00:15:41.480,00:15:43.030,怎么肯放手,00:15:39.200,00:15:42.560,She is having her moment right now.
00:15:44.280,00:15:46.070,奴婢会尽量照顾公主的,00:15:42.600,00:15:45.500,How would she let go?
00:15:46.760,00:15:48.790,还请贵人暂且宽心,00:15:45.640,00:15:50.500,"I will do my best to take care of the princess.
Please don't worry for now, My Lady."
00:15:49.400,00:15:50.990,若真能接公主回宫,,,
00:15:51.280,00:15:53.550,奴婢们也算阿弥陀佛了,00:15:50.660,00:15:55.000,"If the princess can return home,
we will be thankful to Amitābha Buddha."
00:15:55.120,00:15:56.030,好,00:15:55.600,00:15:57.840,Thank you.
00:15:58.360,00:16:00.430,瞧你近日眼圈发青,,,
00:16:02.360,00:16:03.420,是不是没睡好,00:15:59.880,00:16:05.540,"You have dark circles under your eyes.
Did you not sleep well last night?"
00:16:05.480,00:16:06.350,不妨事,,,
00:16:07.320,00:16:08.910,朕方才去看了温宜,00:16:06.280,00:16:08.620,It's all right.
00:16:10.320,00:16:11.190,她有些贪睡,,,
00:16:11.720,00:16:13.390,不像前几日活泼爱笑,00:16:08.700,00:16:14.580,"I saw Wenyi was sleepy today, not so playful as before."
00:16:14.240,00:16:15.460,是不是身子不舒坦,00:16:14.580,00:16:17.580,Is she not feeling well?
00:16:19.360,00:16:21.820,臣妾有罪 没能照顾好公主,00:16:20.720,00:16:23.660,"I entreat Your Majesty's forgiveness for
my failure to take care of the princess."
00:16:22.680,00:16:24.110,温宜年幼不好带,,,
00:16:24.600,00:16:26.670,不如送回曹贵人那里吧,00:16:23.800,00:16:28.640,"It is very difficult to look after such a young child.
You should send her back to Lady Cao."
00:16:28.200,00:16:30.270,曹贵人前些日子身体不适,,,
00:16:30.680,00:16:33.240,顾全不过来 才把公主送来的,00:16:29.660,00:16:35.100,Lady Cao was feeling unwell and sent Wenyi to my care.
00:16:33.840,00:16:34.950,若现在送回去,,,
00:16:36.240,00:16:38.070,怕曹贵人不好养身子,00:16:35.260,00:16:40.220,"I'm afraid it will affect Lady Cao's health
if I send Wenyi back right now."
00:16:40.440,00:16:41.580,皇上有所不知,,,
00:16:41.920,00:16:43.190,公主夜夜啼哭,,,
00:16:43.480,00:16:45.110,所以日里贪睡不爱笑,00:16:41.860,00:16:46.880,"Your Majesty, the princess cried a lot at night
and thus was sleepy during the day."
00:16:45.920,00:16:47.470,娘娘也是夜不能寐,,,
00:16:47.840,00:16:49.190,连眼睛都熬红了,00:16:47.000,00:16:51.240,"Her Highness had to take care of her all night.
That is why Her Highness's eyes are red."
00:16:51.160,00:16:53.790,如此真是难为你了 起来吧,00:16:52.300,00:16:56.000,I appreciate your hard work. Rise.
00:16:55.200,00:16:56.110,谢皇上,00:16:56.200,00:16:58.560,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:04.760,00:17:07.590,公主年幼 啼哭是人之常情,00:17:06.000,00:17:09.600,It is natural for a young child to be prone to crying.
00:17:08.840,00:17:10.230,不过臣妾以为,,,
00:17:10.560,00:17:13.470,这宫中都是女子 阴气太重,00:17:09.760,00:17:15.280,"But in my view, yin is too strong
when women dominantly reside in the palace."
00:17:14.360,00:17:17.030,所以公主夜不能安,00:17:15.280,00:17:18.760,That will disturb the young princess at night.
00:17:18.280,00:17:20.350,若是能有阳气镇殿,00:17:19.480,00:17:21.680,If we have yang to balance with yin ...
00:17:20.600,00:17:23.310,今夜原本就是十六追月之夜,,,
00:17:23.800,00:17:24.860,朕会留下来陪你,00:17:21.800,00:17:27.720,"Today is the 16th of the month.
I will stay here to appreciate the moon with you."
00:17:27.960,00:17:30.070,告诉莞贵人 让她早点睡,00:17:28.960,00:17:31.520,Tell Lady Sourire that she should sleep early.
00:17:30.520,00:17:31.150,嗻,,,
00:17:33.000,00:17:36.070,皇上尝尝这道龟鹤延年汤,00:17:34.200,00:17:37.960,Your Majesty might want to try the turtle-crane longevity soup.
,,,00:17:37.960,00:17:42.000,"[Turtles and cranes are the symbols for longevity.
In fact, the soup uses chicken instead of crane.]"
00:17:47.400,00:17:48.950,倒是没听见温宜哭,00:17:48.700,00:17:51.220,Wenyi is quiet tonight.
00:17:51.880,00:17:53.550,臣妾不是说过嘛,,,
00:17:53.960,00:17:56.630,皇上的帝王之气镇得住阴气,00:17:53.260,00:17:57.900,"Like I said, Your Majesty's yang counteracts the excess yin in her chamber."
00:17:57.120,00:17:58.630,公主便不哭了,00:17:57.900,00:18:00.460,That's why she stopped crying.
00:18:01.720,00:18:02.430,什么声音,00:18:02.660,00:18:04.000,What was that?
00:18:02.920,00:18:06.620,皇上 是雷声 快睡吧,00:18:04.120,00:18:08.960,"It's just thunder, Your Majesty.
We should sleep."
00:18:21.120,00:18:22.390,小主 你怎么了,00:18:22.300,00:18:24.340,"My Lady, are you all right?"
00:18:26.280,00:18:27.630,小主从小就怕雷声,,,
00:18:28.000,00:18:29.350,尤其是这电闪雷鸣的,00:18:27.500,00:18:32.040,"My Lady, you've always been
frightened of thunder since you were young."
00:18:31.600,00:18:33.550,以前在府中都是夫人陪着小主,,,
00:18:33.880,00:18:35.590,进宫后皇上也多半陪着,00:18:32.300,00:18:35.240,Her Ladyship would always be there for you.
00:18:36.200,00:18:38.310,今天就让奴婢陪着小主好吗,00:18:35.240,00:18:37.440,His Majesty would usually visit on a thundering night.
,,,00:18:37.500,00:18:40.460,Would you like my company for tonight?
00:18:40.920,00:18:42.060,此时此刻,00:18:42.320,00:18:44.760,"At this very moment,"
00:18:44.040,00:18:47.990,想必华妃正在婉转承恩吧,00:18:44.800,00:18:50.300,Consort Fleur must be softly whispering to His Majesty.
00:18:52.280,00:18:54.510,这段时间发生太多的事情,00:18:53.760,00:18:56.740,Too much has happened recently.
00:18:56.400,00:18:57.590,我实在太累了,00:18:57.440,00:18:59.820,I'm exhausted.
00:19:00.840,00:19:01.630,奴婢明白,00:19:02.000,00:19:04.080,I understand.
00:19:03.120,00:19:06.190,你出去睡吧 我想静一静,00:19:04.100,00:19:09.040,You should go sleep. I'll have some time to myself.
00:19:27.960,00:19:31.270,嬛嬛 是朕,00:19:29.000,00:19:30.960,Huan Huan ...
00:19:34.200,00:19:35.030,四郎,00:19:30.960,00:19:33.800,it's me.
00:19:36.760,00:19:37.510,四郎,00:19:35.520,00:19:37.080,Si Lang.
00:19:40.000,00:19:41.220,朕被雷声惊醒,00:19:38.000,00:19:40.060,Si Lang.
00:19:42.080,00:19:45.620,想起你害怕这样雷电交加的雨夜,00:19:41.560,00:19:47.320,"I was wakened by thunder, thinking that
you must be scared on such a stormy night."
00:19:47.320,00:19:48.540,外面风雨交加,,,
00:19:50.000,00:19:51.510,四郎实在不必过来,00:19:48.100,00:19:53.300,"Si Lang, you shouldn't have walked through the wind and rain."
00:19:52.000,00:19:53.310,正因风雨交加,,,
00:19:53.960,00:19:55.750,所以不愿意让你害怕,00:19:53.460,00:19:58.100,I wouldn't leave you feeling scared of the storm.
00:19:57.200,00:19:58.260,四郎在别处,,,
00:19:59.080,00:20:02.110,眼不见嬛嬛就不会担心了,00:19:58.280,00:20:03.400,"You shouldn't worry about me
when I'm away out of your sight."
00:20:02.520,00:20:05.310,眼不见 心却可以见,00:20:03.560,00:20:07.480,My heart sees what my eyes don't.
00:20:10.800,00:20:11.990,那华妃娘娘呢,00:20:12.000,00:20:14.500,What about Her Highness?
00:20:17.680,00:20:20.060,四郎会不会永远对嬛嬛那样好,00:20:18.500,00:20:22.020,"Si Lang, will you always be so good to me?"
00:20:21.480,00:20:22.110,会,,,
00:20:23.240,00:20:24.670,即便四郎做不到,00:20:22.200,00:20:24.280,I will.
00:20:25.560,00:20:26.830,只要有这一句话,,,
00:20:27.760,00:20:29.110,嬛嬛便觉得安宁,00:20:24.500,00:20:31.240,Your words always bring peace to my mind.
00:20:39.040,00:20:41.870,娘娘 皇上都走了许久了,00:20:40.000,00:20:43.880,"Your Highness, His Majesty has been away for so long."
00:20:43.680,00:20:45.670,不如娘娘早点歇息吧,00:20:44.500,00:20:47.780,Your Highness might as well sleep for now.
00:20:49.040,00:20:51.110,皇上从来都没有这样过,00:20:49.960,00:20:53.500,His Majesty was never like this.
00:20:54.000,00:20:55.710,他从来都没有这样过,00:20:54.800,00:20:57.760,He was never like this.
00:20:58.200,00:20:58.990,娘娘,00:20:59.100,00:21:00.920,Your Highness.
00:21:17.000,00:21:17.980,娘娘息怒啊,,,
00:21:18.320,00:21:19.190,杀了她,00:21:17.500,00:21:19.580,May peace be restored in Your Highness.
,,,00:21:19.600,00:21:21.500,She'll die.
00:21:37.720,00:21:40.070,娘娘 皇上离了清凉殿,,,
00:21:40.400,00:21:41.830,冒雨去了碧桐书院,00:21:38.800,00:21:44.380,"Your Majesty, His Majesty left the Cooling Hall
and walked to Verdant Reading Hall in the rain."
00:21:44.560,00:21:46.030,华妃也有今日,00:21:45.480,00:21:47.900,Consort Fleur has had her day.
00:21:47.640,00:21:50.230,旧爱虽好 难敌新宠,00:21:48.660,00:21:51.860,A new fire burns higher than the old flame.
00:21:50.720,00:21:52.150,本宫当年的屈辱,,,
00:21:52.560,00:21:54.150,她今日也算饱尝了,00:21:51.860,00:21:56.060,Consort Fleur can now feast on the same humiliation I experienced.
00:21:54.880,00:21:56.870,从前皇上在娘娘这儿,,,
00:21:57.400,00:21:59.780,是她使诡计哄皇上去的,00:21:56.100,00:22:01.440,"When His Majesty visited you, Consort Fleur would try
every trick in the book to make him leave."
00:22:00.240,00:22:02.750,如今呀 是皇上自己愿意去的,00:22:01.600,00:22:04.520,"But this time, His Majesty chose to leave."
00:22:03.320,00:22:05.750,人在心不在 强留也无用,00:22:04.520,00:22:07.840,"It's no use keeping His Majesty for the night
when you can't keep his heart."
00:22:07.120,00:22:08.990,本宫记得去年两广总督,,,
00:22:09.280,00:22:13.230,曾进献本宫一架鸳鸯和合屏风,00:22:08.360,00:22:12.880,"The Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces
presented me with a mandarin duck folding screen."
00:22:14.640,00:22:16.230,便赏给莞贵人吧,00:22:12.980,00:22:15.200,[Mandarin ducks are believed to be lifelong couples.]
00:22:17.000,00:22:17.710,是,00:22:15.200,00:22:18.100,I'll give it to Lady Sourire.
00:22:18.960,00:22:20.020,你点的什么香啊,00:22:18.100,00:22:19.660,Yes.
00:22:21.440,00:22:23.630,奴婢见外面下雨 水汽重,00:22:20.000,00:22:22.080,What incense did you light in the censer?
00:22:23.880,00:22:26.830,娘娘又在念经 所以点了檀香,00:22:22.580,00:22:28.780,"I lit sandalwood when I saw Your Majesty
chanting on such a humid night."
00:22:29.080,00:22:33.590,诚信礼佛 心意岂在一炷香上,00:22:30.000,00:22:35.480,Homage to the Buddha is not paid by the incense we burn.
00:22:35.400,00:22:36.870,这再名贵的香料,,,
00:22:37.240,00:22:38.630,总是以人工做成的,00:22:36.060,00:22:41.000,"Even the finest incense is artificially produced
and carries a whiff from the secular world."
00:22:39.000,00:22:40.590,难免沾了污浊气息,,,
00:22:41.840,00:22:44.220,哪及花香果香自然呢,00:22:42.580,00:22:46.320,I prefer the natural scents from flowers and fruits.
00:22:45.400,00:22:46.430,拿出去吧,00:22:46.500,00:22:48.940,You may put it away.

00:24:24.360,00:24:25.670,总是最打动人的,00:24:21.960,00:24:27.680,"""A lotus out of water is refreshingly unadorned."""
00:24:27.480,00:24:28.190,走吧,00:24:28.260,00:24:30.040,Let's go.
00:24:41.720,00:24:43.030,两位小主吉祥,00:24:42.380,00:24:45.260,Peace to My Ladies.
00:24:44.920,00:24:47.190,你看那对鸳鸯 真是好意头,00:24:45.400,00:24:50.000,"Look, there's a pair of mandarin ducks.
It's an auspicious sign."
00:24:48.800,00:24:51.870,姐姐 我怕做不好,00:24:50.100,00:24:53.740,"Sourire, I'm nervous."
00:24:52.600,00:24:54.030,要不换个法子吧,00:24:53.740,00:24:55.940,Should we think of something else?
00:24:58.200,00:24:59.990,若是寻常把你引荐给皇上,,,
00:25:00.680,00:25:01.820,自然也无不可,00:24:59.220,00:25:03.740,"If I present you to His Majesty in an ordinary way,"
00:25:02.640,00:25:03.750,只是这样做的话,,,
00:25:04.360,00:25:05.310,即使蒙幸,,,
00:25:05.760,00:25:07.550,皇上也未必会把你放在心上,00:25:03.740,00:25:09.360,"that would be acceptable
but His Majesty might forget you after a few days."
00:25:08.480,00:25:10.070,不过三五日便丢开了,,,
00:25:10.840,00:25:11.870,反而误了你,00:25:09.360,00:25:13.800,It would hinder you from your future advancement.
00:25:12.560,00:25:15.430,中元节祭祀乃是宫中大事,,,
00:25:15.960,00:25:17.180,要好好操持,00:25:14.000,00:25:18.900,"Zhongyuan [Ghost Festival] is an important festival in the palace.
We must be prepared for the rituals."
00:25:17.640,00:25:18.350,是,,,
00:25:19.720,00:25:22.590,本宫听说温宜公主一直啼哭不适,00:25:18.900,00:25:20.340,Certainly.
00:25:24.240,00:25:27.190,臣妾会叫法师为她作法祈福的,00:25:20.500,00:25:28.540,"Princess Wenyi has not been very well.
I will tell the priests to pray for her."
,,,00:25:28.540,00:25:34.000,"""Cherish not your gold-woven robe, in truth.
Cherish but your golden days of youth."""
00:25:33.600,00:25:34.660,谁在唱歌呢,,,
00:25:35.200,00:25:36.710,可能是宫中的歌伎吧,00:25:34.000,00:25:36.320,Who is singing?
,,,00:25:36.320,00:25:38.720,It might be a performer in the palace.
00:25:38.640,00:25:41.430,这么好听的歌声确实难得,00:25:39.640,00:25:43.280,Such a beautiful voice is a rarity in the palace.
,,,00:25:43.280,00:25:58.800,"""Cull the flower in its full bloom,
not the empty branch you’d carry with gloom."""
00:25:59.600,00:26:00.430,姐姐,00:25:58.900,00:26:02.120,Sourire.
00:26:02.160,00:26:03.670,叫人闻之欲醉呢,00:26:03.100,00:26:05.740,Your voice is inebriating.
00:26:04.800,00:26:05.990,姐姐真会取笑,00:26:05.740,00:26:08.400,You must not make fun of me.
00:26:08.280,00:26:09.470,谁在唱歌啊,00:26:09.400,00:26:11.520,Who was singing?
00:26:13.760,00:26:14.790,华妃娘娘金安,,,
00:26:15.160,00:26:15.910,华妃娘娘金安,00:26:14.000,00:26:17.300,Peace to Your Highness.
00:26:18.640,00:26:19.550,起来吧,,,
00:26:20.040,00:26:20.750,是,00:26:19.940,00:26:21.160,You may rise.
,,,00:26:21.160,00:26:22.060,Yes.
00:26:21.720,00:26:23.790,莞贵人何时学会歌唱了,00:26:22.740,00:26:24.740,"When did you learn to sing, Lady Sourire?"
00:26:25.560,00:26:29.870,能歌善舞 真是叫本宫意外呀,00:26:26.580,00:26:30.880,I'm surprised by your talent for both singing and dancing.
00:26:31.440,00:26:32.550,娘娘谬赞了,,,
00:26:32.880,00:26:34.470,嫔妾何来如此歌喉,00:26:32.660,00:26:33.960,I'm not the one to be praised by Your Highness.
00:26:34.840,00:26:36.550,乃答应安氏所歌,00:26:33.960,00:26:35.960,I could never sing so well.
,,,00:26:35.960,00:26:37.960,It was Companion An.
00:26:42.120,00:26:43.630,本宫当是谁,00:26:43.480,00:26:44.980,I was wondering who it was.
00:26:44.400,00:26:46.750,原来是日前才被皇上宽恕的,,,
00:26:47.160,00:26:48.110,安比槐之女,00:26:45.600,00:26:49.500,"It turns out that it is the daughter of An Bihuai,
who has just been pardoned for his crime."
00:26:49.240,00:26:52.190,罪臣之女不闭门思过,,,
00:26:52.760,00:26:56.990,竟然到处招摇往来 不知检点,00:26:50.540,00:26:55.420,"How dare the daughter of a former convict
act so ostentatiously in public?"
,,,00:26:56.800,00:26:57.880,What shamelessness!
00:26:58.840,00:27:01.030,嫔妾父亲不是罪臣,00:27:00.000,00:27:02.500,My father did not commit any crime.
00:27:01.760,00:27:04.830,安答应之父无罪而释 官复原职,00:27:02.860,00:27:05.860,Companion An's father was released and reinstated after his acquittal.
00:27:05.240,00:27:06.070,并非罪臣,00:27:05.860,00:27:07.360,He did not offend His Majesty.
00:27:06.560,00:27:09.190,无罪而释也并不代表真正无辜,00:27:07.700,00:27:10.660,Being acquitted doesn't mean he is not guilty at all.
00:27:09.760,00:27:12.510,个中因由莞贵人应该很清楚,00:27:10.660,00:27:13.360,I need not remind Lady Sourire why he was released.
00:27:12.960,00:27:15.520,小小答应不懂规矩也就罢了,00:27:14.000,00:27:16.560,"Since this Companion does not know how to behave,"
00:27:15.840,00:27:18.220,怎的莞贵人也不教会她礼义廉耻,00:27:16.560,00:27:19.440,you must teach her proper decorum and good morality.
00:27:19.280,00:27:22.310,歌曲而已 怎的关乎礼义廉耻,00:27:20.440,00:27:23.280,"She was simply singing a song.
That does not concern decorum or morality."
00:27:27.160,00:27:29.390,有花堪折直须折,00:27:28.120,00:27:30.800,"""Cull the flower in its full bloom ..."""
00:27:31.000,00:27:33.300,向来都是以花比作女人的,00:27:32.320,00:27:34.620,Flower is known as a metaphor for women.
00:27:33.680,00:27:36.750,她如此唱来 岂不是招蜂引蝶,00:27:34.800,00:27:38.000,"So this line implies she would like to
""attract the bees and butterflies"""
00:27:37.160,00:27:38.950,愿意让人任意攀折,00:27:38.000,00:27:40.600,and she is ready to be culled.
00:27:40.520,00:27:41.990,此歌名金缕衣,,,
00:27:42.280,00:27:43.710,乃劝人懂得珍惜,00:27:41.560,00:27:45.356,"The song is titled ""The Gold-Woven Robe"".
It advises us to cherish time more than gold."
00:27:44.160,00:27:45.710,并非娘娘所说的意思,00:27:45.360,00:27:47.000,Your Highness misinterpreted the line.
00:27:47.000,00:27:48.990,莞贵人倒真是善于言辞,00:27:47.580,00:27:50.500,Lady Sourire is an eloquent speaker indeed.
00:27:49.720,00:27:52.510,只可惜妇人向来都是以柔顺为德,,,
00:27:52.920,00:27:54.270,不以强辩为美,00:27:50.820,00:27:55.600,"Unfortunately, obedience rather than sophistry
is the traditional virtue of women."
00:27:54.880,00:27:56.550,莞贵人竟然连妇德都不遵循,,,
00:27:57.000,00:27:57.980,语出犯上,00:27:55.980,00:27:58.920,What defiance of feminine virtues it is to offend your superior!
00:27:59.600,00:28:00.390,嫔妾不敢,00:28:00.660,00:28:01.760,I dare not.
00:28:03.120,00:28:04.950,莞贵人不是有心冒犯娘娘,00:28:04.320,00:28:06.200,Lady Sourire had no intention to offend Your Highness.
00:28:05.400,00:28:06.380,还望娘娘恕罪,00:28:06.320,00:28:07.860,I beg Your Highness's pardon.
00:28:07.000,00:28:10.030,有罪时再来恕罪未必太晚了吧,00:28:08.140,00:28:11.940,"Isn't it too late to beg for pardon
once an offence has been committed?"
00:28:11.480,00:28:13.190,本宫作为众妃之首,00:28:12.600,00:28:14.680,"As the head of His Majesty's consorts,"
00:28:14.000,00:28:15.060,必定竭尽全力,,,
00:28:15.440,00:28:17.230,教会两位妹妹应守的规矩,00:28:14.680,00:28:18.200,I will spare no effort in enforcing the rules of the palace.
00:28:20.040,00:28:20.830,来人哪,,,
00:28:21.160,00:28:21.830,是,00:28:21.060,00:28:22.940,"-Somebody, come!
-Yes."
00:28:28.000,00:28:30.790,皇上万福 皇后万福,00:28:28.800,00:28:31.700,Grace to Your Majesties.
00:28:31.560,00:28:33.670,这歌声甚是美妙,00:28:32.660,00:28:35.000,That was very beautiful singing.
00:28:48.400,00:28:49.950,你甚少穿得这样艳丽,00:28:49.320,00:28:51.320,I rarely see you wearing bright colors.
00:28:55.920,00:28:56.630,起来吧,00:28:56.800,00:28:58.300,You may rise.
00:28:59.640,00:29:01.990,怎么 今儿有点不太高兴,00:29:00.500,00:29:03.740,You look a little unhappy today?
00:29:03.600,00:29:04.790,青天白日的,,,
00:29:05.320,00:29:07.350,竟在宫里唱这些靡靡之音,00:29:04.700,00:29:09.000,I cannot tolerate the singing of a decadent song in broad daylight.
00:29:14.160,00:29:16.540,你说 这歌怎么样,00:29:15.220,00:29:18.200,You tell me ... How was the singing?
00:29:17.320,00:29:20.030,安答应的歌声如同天籁,00:29:18.920,00:29:20.920,Companion An has a celestial voice.
00:29:21.720,00:29:24.550,皇后娘娘夸奖 臣妾愧不敢受,00:29:22.900,00:29:25.580,I'm unworthy of Your Majesty's commendation.
00:29:27.160,00:29:31.470,唯有昆山玉碎 香兰泣露,00:29:28.400,00:29:35.560,"""A snap of the Kunlun Jade; a dewdrop on the cotton rose""
could barely compare with the beauty of her voice."
00:29:32.600,00:29:34.230,才可以勉强比拟,,,
00:29:39.360,00:29:40.270,你抬起头来,00:29:40.360,00:29:42.180,Raise your head.
00:29:45.280,00:29:48.150,好一个有花堪折直须折,00:29:46.320,00:29:49.360,"I like the line ""cull the flower in its full bloom""."
00:29:48.880,00:29:49.710,你叫什么名,,,
00:29:50.640,00:29:51.470,安陵容,00:29:49.920,00:29:51.360,What is your name?
00:29:54.240,00:29:56.540,回皇上话时要加臣妾二字,00:29:51.460,00:29:53.000,An Lingrong.
00:29:56.920,00:29:57.900,方才不算失礼,00:29:55.280,00:29:58.740,"You must say ""Your Majesty"" in your responses."
00:29:58.760,00:29:59.950,多谢娘娘赐教,,,
00:30:01.120,00:30:02.990,看来华妃你跟安答应,00:29:59.880,00:30:01.620,I humbly thank Your Highness for the advice.
00:30:03.320,00:30:05.110,还有很长的时间可以见面,00:30:02.320,00:30:06.460,"Consort Fleur will have many more
opportunities to talk to Companion An."
00:30:06.160,00:30:09.470,妹妹呀慢慢教 反正有的是时间,00:30:07.300,00:30:11.000,You'll have plenty of time to teach her in the future.
00:30:10.320,00:30:11.270,这个当然,00:30:11.540,00:30:13.000,Of course I will.
00:30:12.160,00:30:14.870,皇后治理后宫已然是千头万绪,00:30:13.360,00:30:15.820,Managing the palace is like sorting tangled threads.
00:30:15.640,00:30:18.710,臣妾理当为您分忧,00:30:16.720,00:30:19.660,I must carry some of the burden for Your Majesty.
00:30:25.360,00:30:26.030,很好,,,
00:30:26.960,00:30:29.030,歌清爽 人亦清爽,00:30:26.400,00:30:30.560,"Very well, you are as beautiful as your voice."
00:30:31.360,00:30:35.140,皇上 臣妾有些乏了 想先回去,00:30:32.440,00:30:34.960,"Your Majesty, I'm feeling a bit tired."
00:30:35.640,00:30:36.430,好,00:30:35.060,00:30:36.700,May I take my leave?
,,,00:30:36.700,00:30:37.700,Certainly.
00:30:36.760,00:30:39.510,流朱 快 送莞贵人回去好好休息,00:30:37.960,00:30:40.600,"Vermilion, take care of Lady Sourire."
00:30:40.000,00:30:40.670,是,00:30:40.780,00:30:41.840,Yes.
00:30:42.240,00:30:44.070,那妹妹也先陪姐姐回去,00:30:43.340,00:30:45.500,I will go with Sourire.
00:31:04.680,00:31:06.830,本宫很喜欢安答应的曲子,00:31:06.300,00:31:08.300,I enjoyed her song very much.
00:31:07.800,00:31:10.430,让她再唱一遍给本宫和皇上听,00:31:09.020,00:31:12.000,I hope she will sing again for me and Your Majesty.
00:31:11.200,00:31:12.390,请安答应回来吧,,,
00:31:12.720,00:31:13.390,嗻,00:31:12.120,00:31:14.440,Please ask Companion An to come back.
,,,00:31:14.440,00:31:15.560,Yes.
00:31:27.800,00:31:29.830,姐姐 我先回去了,00:31:29.100,00:31:31.080,"Sourire, I'll see you later."
00:31:30.680,00:31:33.910,好好歇歇 等着入夜皇上传召你,00:31:31.560,00:31:34.900,Have some rest and be prepared for serving His Majesty tonight.
00:31:37.160,00:31:39.870,莞贵人留步 安答应留步,00:31:38.220,00:31:41.440,"My Ladies, may I have your attention?"
00:31:41.040,00:31:41.790,怎么了,00:31:42.000,00:31:43.080,"Yes, sir."
00:31:42.120,00:31:45.350,皇上有请安答应,00:31:43.220,00:31:47.220,His Majesty would like Companion An to come back.
00:31:53.000,00:31:53.750,还不快去,00:31:53.900,00:31:55.560,Go quickly.
00:32:04.720,00:32:05.470,快去吧,00:32:05.800,00:32:08.080,You should go now.
,,,00:32:09.060,00:32:10.640,Mm.
00:32:23.120,00:32:24.990,回皇上 安答应到了,00:32:24.380,00:32:27.400,"Your Majesty, Companion An is here."
00:32:28.640,00:32:29.230,皇上,00:32:29.240,00:32:31.320,Your Majesty.
00:32:34.000,00:32:34.790,陪朕走走,,,
00:32:36.720,00:32:38.430,臣妾有几件中元节的事,00:32:35.080,00:32:37.440,Come walk with me.
00:32:38.840,00:32:40.190,想跟华妃商量着办,00:32:37.960,00:32:41.500,I need to talk to Consort Fleur about the Zhongyuan Festival.
00:32:40.840,00:32:42.350,不能陪皇上游园了,,,
00:32:42.680,00:32:43.350,你看着办,00:32:41.720,00:32:43.680,I'm afraid I can't accompany Your Majesty for the rest of the day.
,,,00:32:43.680,00:32:45.100,If you say so.
00:32:51.760,00:32:54.220,华妃 咱们走吧,00:32:52.580,00:32:55.940,"Consort Fleur, shall we?"
00:33:01.320,00:33:02.750,小主即刻要回去吗,00:33:02.260,00:33:05.200,"Do you wish to go home now, My Lady?"
00:33:05.280,00:33:06.500,沿着湖边走走吧,00:33:06.360,00:33:08.840,Let's have a walk along the lake.
00:33:14.800,00:33:16.550,小主今日这衣裳真好看,,,
00:33:17.000,00:33:18.220,您素日不爱穿红,00:33:15.940,00:33:17.940,"My Lady, you look gorgeous in this dress."
00:33:18.600,00:33:19.580,其实红色多好看,00:33:17.940,00:33:20.700,"You used to not wear red,
but what a beautiful color it is!"
00:33:20.000,00:33:21.910,又喜气 跟云霞似的,00:33:21.020,00:33:23.060,It looks like the rosy clouds.
00:33:22.400,00:33:24.910,这绣的海棠花又是小主最喜欢的,00:33:23.060,00:33:26.580,"And it's embroidered with crabapple flowers, your favorite!"
00:33:27.320,00:33:30.510,宫里的刺绣自然是上好的,00:33:28.560,00:33:32.480,"Of course, the palace has embroidery of the highest quality."
00:33:32.000,00:33:34.560,一针一线 千丝万缕,00:33:32.760,00:33:37.360,Thousands and thousands of threads and stitches ...
00:33:36.680,00:33:38.430,多少心血织就这美丽,00:33:37.880,00:33:40.380,Beauty is knitted with so much effort.
00:33:39.680,00:33:41.350,缺一针少一线都不可,00:33:40.820,00:33:43.940,Each thread is essential and every stitch is necessary.
00:33:43.960,00:33:47.430,流朱 你说针尖那么利,00:33:45.780,00:33:49.140,"Vermilion, the needle is so sharp."
00:33:48.400,00:33:51.940,刺破绸缎的时候 绸缎会不会痛,00:33:49.340,00:33:53.240,Did the satin hurt when the needle pierced it?
00:33:54.240,00:33:56.700,小主好好的怎么想这些啊,00:33:55.540,00:33:58.260,"My Lady, why would you think about that?"
00:33:57.400,00:33:58.190,若是刺绣,,,
00:33:58.760,00:34:00.550,那缎子本来就是用针扎的,00:33:58.760,00:34:02.900,"To create embroidery, the satin has to be pierced by the needle."
00:34:01.000,00:34:01.790,那是命数,,,
00:34:02.320,00:34:04.880,这缎子又不是人 哪知痛不痛啊,00:34:03.560,00:34:06.680,"But the satin is not a person.
It doesn't feel any pain."
00:34:09.680,00:34:12.350,小主 你看那荷花开得这样盛,00:34:10.300,00:34:13.380,"My Lady, look at the thriving lotus flowers."
00:34:12.760,00:34:13.430,多好看啊,,,
00:34:14.360,00:34:15.030,你看啊,00:34:13.380,00:34:15.120,How beautiful they are!
,,,00:34:15.380,00:34:17.160,Look ...
00:34:18.320,00:34:21.390,是啊 荷花开得那么好,00:34:19.320,00:34:23.020,"Yes, the lotus flowers are so beautiful."
00:34:23.280,00:34:25.190,早不是海棠盛开的季节了,00:34:24.300,00:34:27.900,It's no longer the season for crabapple flowers.
,,,00:34:32.480,00:34:40.780,"Cherish not your gold-woven robe, in truth."
,,,00:34:41.480,00:34:49.780,Cherish but your golden days of youth.
,,,00:34:50.160,00:34:58.420,"Cull the flower in its full bloom,"
00:35:01.000,00:35:01.950,多谢皇上,00:34:59.160,00:35:01.960,not the empty branch you’d carry with gloom.
,,,00:35:01.960,00:35:06.700,I thank Your Majesty.
,,,00:35:08.080,00:35:15.500,not the empty branch you’d carry with gloom.
00:35:19.040,00:35:20.180,给果郡王请安,,,
00:35:20.640,00:35:21.270,快起来吧,00:35:20.300,00:35:21.900,Peace to Noble Prince Guo.
00:35:21.640,00:35:22.430,皇上在里面吗,00:35:21.900,00:35:22.740,Rise.
00:35:22.720,00:35:23.860,还约了我一同下棋呢,00:35:22.740,00:35:25.380,"Is His Majesty inside?
He invited me to play Go with him."
00:35:25.360,00:35:27.550,眼下皇上怕是不方便见您了,00:35:26.640,00:35:29.580,I'm afraid it's not a good time.
00:35:29.640,00:35:31.270,听说又得了一位妙音娘子,,,
00:35:31.960,00:35:33.150,歌喉比上一个更好,00:35:30.820,00:35:34.980,"I heard that there's another Lady Melodic,
who has an even more beautiful voice."
00:35:34.200,00:35:35.230,是安答应,,,
00:35:36.520,00:35:37.870,我还以为是莞贵人呢,00:35:35.500,00:35:37.080,It is Companion An.
00:35:38.440,00:35:40.550,平日侍驾倒是莞贵人最多,00:35:37.220,00:35:39.600,I thought it was Lady Sourire.
00:35:41.080,00:35:42.910,往后看来倒未必了,00:35:39.680,00:35:42.020,Lady Sourire has been with His Majesty most of the time.
00:35:44.680,00:35:47.270,如此 看来我倒来错了时候,00:35:42.280,00:35:45.180,But that might be different from now on.
00:35:47.880,00:35:49.270,麻烦明儿个通报皇上一声,00:35:46.020,00:35:48.680,I see. I should have come at a convenient time.
00:35:49.680,00:35:50.270,就说本王来过了,00:35:49.000,00:35:51.400,"Tomorrow, please tell His Majesty that I came."
00:35:50.600,00:35:50.950,嗻,,,
00:35:51.240,00:35:51.830,告辞,,,
00:35:52.160,00:35:52.870,王爷好走,00:35:51.400,00:35:52.700,"-Yes.
-Goodbye."
00:35:54.120,00:35:56.070,奴才也该吩咐人上夜了,00:35:53.240,00:35:55.160,I bid Your Lordship goodbye.
,,,00:35:55.320,00:35:58.260,I'm going to schedule night shifts.
00:36:17.360,00:36:18.310,小主回来了,00:36:18.000,00:36:20.000,"You're back, My Lady."
00:36:20.120,00:36:21.870,恭喜小主 贺喜小主,00:36:20.800,00:36:22.660,"Congratulations, My Lady."
00:36:22.240,00:36:22.990,快起来吧,,,
00:36:24.280,00:36:26.070,本想在门口候着小主回来,00:36:22.880,00:36:24.580,Stand up quickly.
00:36:26.600,00:36:27.740,却没有听到动静,00:36:25.000,00:36:29.580,"I was waiting for the announcement of your arrival,
My Lady, but I didn't hear anything."
00:36:31.040,00:36:33.110,原本该坐着车送回来的,00:36:31.500,00:36:34.500,I should have come back in a carriage.
00:36:33.960,00:36:35.350,我却想自己走一走,00:36:34.500,00:36:36.620,But I preferred to take a walk by myself.
00:36:36.000,00:36:37.030,便走回来了,00:36:37.020,00:36:37.960,And here I am.
00:36:37.600,00:36:39.350,小主何苦这样劳动自己呢,00:36:38.600,00:36:40.800,"My Lady, why would you take the trouble to walk?"
00:36:40.160,00:36:45.310,从前我走在路上总是低头谨慎,00:36:41.100,00:36:46.460,I have always walked looking down with caution.
00:36:46.320,00:36:48.880,今日成了真正的小主,00:36:47.300,00:36:50.260,Now I have truly become a concubine.
00:36:50.200,00:36:52.500,却不知道走在路上是什么滋味,00:36:51.300,00:36:54.200,I was wondering how it would feel to walk in the palace now.
00:36:53.560,00:36:55.750,所以想走一走,00:36:54.500,00:36:57.080,That's why I preferred to walk.
00:36:56.400,00:36:57.950,小主现在感觉如何,00:36:57.300,00:37:00.000,"How was your trip walking back, My Lady?"
00:37:01.840,00:37:03.430,从前我只是看着路,00:37:02.300,00:37:05.640,I used to keep my eyes on the road.
00:37:05.560,00:37:11.430,却未发现原来行宫山水花草,00:37:05.900,00:37:17.400,"But today I discovered the pleasantness of
the trees and flowers in the palace."
00:37:12.240,00:37:13.750,如此合人心意,,,
00:37:20.320,00:37:21.510,安答应得宠,,,
00:37:21.880,00:37:23.190,小主好像并不高兴,00:37:20.000,00:37:24.680,"My Lady, you don't seem to be happy
about Companion An's advancement."
00:37:23.880,00:37:26.710,意料之中的事 自然无惊喜,00:37:25.000,00:37:29.160,There's no surprise in an anticipated event.
00:37:29.680,00:37:31.430,小主 安答应来了,00:37:30.500,00:37:33.300,"My Lady, Companion An is here."
00:37:33.040,00:37:33.710,姐姐,,,
00:37:36.080,00:37:37.390,怎么一早就过来了,00:37:33.900,00:37:35.720,Sourire.
00:37:38.640,00:37:39.990,刚给皇后请了安,00:37:36.800,00:37:39.180,Why did you come so early in the morning?
00:37:40.560,00:37:42.630,惦记着姐姐所以就过来了,00:37:39.400,00:37:41.400,I have just paid my respects to the Empress.
00:37:45.520,00:37:47.190,安小主现在不一样了,00:37:41.400,00:37:45.320,I was thinking that I should visit you.
00:37:48.160,00:37:49.470,原不用天天过来的,00:37:46.600,00:37:49.000,Companion An is different now.
00:37:52.760,00:37:54.150,外头有刚沏的枫露茶,00:37:49.200,00:37:51.440,You used to not visit My Lady every day.
00:37:54.480,00:37:55.620,已经出了三四遍色了,,,
00:37:56.080,00:37:57.060,你去端来给安小主,00:37:53.800,00:38:00.380,"The Maple Dew tea has been steeped for three times.
Please bring some to Companion An."
00:38:04.200,00:38:05.260,姐姐怪陵容吗,00:38:04.800,00:38:06.400,"Sourire, do you blame me?"
00:38:05.640,00:38:06.310,怎会,00:38:06.400,00:38:07.484,Why would I?
00:38:06.840,00:38:08.950,你有今日我高兴还来不及呢,00:38:07.484,00:38:10.480,Nothing would make me happier than seeing you in favor.
00:38:10.240,00:38:11.460,是我一力促成的,,,
00:38:12.200,00:38:13.590,我怎会有怪罪之意呢,00:38:11.100,00:38:15.000,"And we spared no effort to make this happen.
Why would I blame you for anything?"
00:38:14.240,00:38:15.830,若使姐姐有丝毫不快,,,
00:38:16.280,00:38:17.750,陵容必不再见皇上,00:38:15.200,00:38:18.420,"Sourire, if it caused you any uneasiness,
I shall not see His Majesty again."
00:38:18.160,00:38:19.070,这是赌气话,00:38:18.500,00:38:20.500,You're talking like a child.
00:38:20.520,00:38:22.630,怎么说我也是半个媒人,00:38:21.600,00:38:24.460,I am the matchmaker in a sense.
00:38:23.680,00:38:25.550,新娘怎能为了媒人,,,
00:38:25.960,00:38:26.990,而不见新郎的面呢,00:38:24.600,00:38:28.000,A matchmaker only hopes the bride and groom will see each other again.
00:38:27.320,00:38:28.300,姐姐惯会取笑我,00:38:28.000,00:38:30.000,You'd always make fun of me.
00:38:30.440,00:38:31.660,姐姐不怪我就好,00:38:31.400,00:38:34.100,Good to know that you don't blame me.
00:38:36.720,00:38:38.070,你这衣裳颜色倒好,,,
00:38:38.640,00:38:39.620,极衬你的肤色,00:38:37.800,00:38:40.960,The color of your dress really flatters your skin tone.
00:38:41.080,00:38:42.950,这是苏州新贡的浮光锦,00:38:41.900,00:38:44.160,It's made of the tributary Glinting Satin from Suzhou Province.
00:38:43.360,00:38:46.670,听说行动时可以如波光粼粼,00:38:44.200,00:38:48.180,They say it shimmers in motion under the sun.
00:38:47.440,00:38:49.950,我也只是瞧着颜色好看就穿上了,00:38:48.400,00:38:51.580,I really like its color so I put it on.
00:38:50.720,00:38:54.230,我记得这浮光锦一共才几件,00:38:51.900,00:38:55.660,"I remember that only a few pieces of
Glinting Satin are offered each year."
00:38:54.720,00:38:55.910,皇上都赏了你吧,00:38:55.660,00:38:57.740,"His Majesty rewarded them all to you, didn't he?"
00:38:57.040,00:38:58.100,原是都赏了我,00:38:57.800,00:38:59.660,"Yes, he did."
00:38:59.400,00:39:01.750,只是我哪里敢用这么好的东西,00:38:59.900,00:39:03.120,But I dare not keep all of them.
00:39:02.360,00:39:03.340,我只留了一件,00:39:03.500,00:39:05.200,I only saved one piece for myself.
00:39:04.240,00:39:06.620,还有两件送给了皇后和华妃,00:39:05.200,00:39:08.100,Two were given to the Empress and Consort Fleur.
00:39:07.480,00:39:10.990,另两件我拿来送给姐姐,00:39:08.400,00:39:12.620,And I wish you would keep the other two pieces.
00:39:12.520,00:39:13.550,劳你费心了,,,
00:39:14.560,00:39:15.590,原是应该的,00:39:13.100,00:39:15.100,Thank you for thinking of me.
00:39:17.520,00:39:19.900,听说这浮光锦在唐朝时,00:39:15.100,00:39:17.540,It's my pleasure.
00:39:20.280,00:39:21.340,是高昌国的贡品,00:39:18.000,00:39:22.760,"They say the Glinting Satin was offered as tribute by
the Kingdom of Gaochang in the Tang Dynasty."
00:39:21.760,00:39:23.070,下雨也沾不湿的,00:39:22.760,00:39:24.140,It wouldn't get wet in the rain.
00:39:23.440,00:39:25.390,到了现在咱们自己也能做了,00:39:24.300,00:39:26.300,"Now that we are able to produce it in Suzhou,"
00:39:25.920,00:39:26.710,只是不知道,,,
00:39:27.000,00:39:28.790,是不是连雨天也沾不湿,00:39:26.300,00:39:30.080,I wonder if it's truly water-resistant.
00:39:29.720,00:39:32.020,那下次雨天我就穿来试试,00:39:30.400,00:39:32.840,I will try it on when it rains.
,,,00:39:32.840,00:39:34.720,Mm.
00:39:40.000,00:39:41.220,这几日倒是怪了,00:39:40.600,00:39:42.620,This is strange.
00:39:42.120,00:39:43.070,陵容小主有两三天,,,
00:39:43.440,00:39:44.390,没来咱们这儿了吧,00:39:42.620,00:39:46.060,Lingrong hasn't visited for a couple of days.
00:39:45.080,00:39:46.390,这几日闷得难受,,,
00:39:46.760,00:39:47.870,谁愿意出来走动,00:39:46.500,00:39:49.000,Who would come out in such sultry weather?
00:39:48.240,00:39:49.550,皇后娘娘连这几日的,,,
00:39:49.960,00:39:51.070,晨昏定省都免了呢,00:39:49.000,00:39:52.420,The Empress even waived our daily visits.
00:39:51.600,00:39:52.310,这倒是,,,
00:39:53.640,00:39:55.310,不过只要皇上能来就是了,00:39:52.500,00:39:54.120,That's true.
00:39:57.720,00:39:58.860,小主盼着就是了,00:39:54.600,00:39:57.800,As long as His Majesty still comes here.
00:39:59.280,00:40:00.310,你这样盼着做什么,00:39:58.600,00:40:01.300,"It's all right for My Lady think like that.
Why are you looking forward to His Majesty's visits?"
00:40:00.960,00:40:02.310,让你嘴坏 谁盼着了,00:40:01.300,00:40:03.300,Don't say that! I'm not!
00:40:02.680,00:40:03.430,你就盼着了 你盼着了,,,
00:40:03.720,00:40:04.150,就你盼着了,,,
00:40:04.480,00:40:05.350,你当心小主听了不高兴,00:40:03.300,00:40:05.300,You are! You are!
00:40:05.680,00:40:06.790,就你盼着了 就你盼着了,00:40:05.300,00:40:07.040,My Lady would be unhappy if she hears it.
00:40:07.520,00:40:08.350,你别乱说,00:40:07.040,00:40:10.300,"- But you are!
- I'm not! Stop it!"
00:40:11.000,00:40:11.870,姑姑,00:40:11.300,00:40:13.300,Madam.
00:40:13.280,00:40:15.790,二位姑娘 那小主就在里边呢,00:40:14.300,00:40:16.500,"Girls, My Lady is inside."
00:40:16.280,00:40:17.630,万一等一下皇上来了,,,
00:40:18.080,00:40:20.070,看见这吵吵闹闹的多不像话,00:40:17.300,00:40:21.300,It's inappropriate to be so loud should His Majesty visit.
00:40:20.760,00:40:22.670,姑姑拿着食盒是要去哪里啊,00:40:21.900,00:40:24.340,"Madam, where are you heading to with the food box?"
00:40:23.680,00:40:25.470,小主让去看看安小主,,,
00:40:25.800,00:40:27.630,说安小主身体弱怕中暑,00:40:24.500,00:40:27.100,My Lady sends me to visit Attendant An.
00:40:28.280,00:40:29.670,让我送这些十金水,00:40:27.100,00:40:29.100,She was worried that Attendant An might feel unwell in the heat.
00:40:30.160,00:40:31.300,和仁丹丸药过去,00:40:29.100,00:40:32.840,She asked me to give her some preventive medicine.
00:40:32.600,00:40:34.900,小主疼她倒比疼我跟流朱更多,00:40:33.400,00:40:36.520,My Lady cares more about her than Vermillion and me.
00:40:35.600,00:40:39.110,越说越上劲头了 可不许这样,00:40:37.200,00:40:39.880,"Jade, that's enough.
You must not talk like that."
00:40:39.680,00:40:40.470,知道了,,,
00:40:41.360,00:40:43.230,人家现在已经是安常在了,00:40:39.900,00:40:41.900,"Yes, Madam."
00:40:43.600,00:40:44.990,我们只不过是丫头片子罢了,00:40:42.200,00:40:46.780,She is an Attendant now while we are just her maids.
00:40:51.560,00:40:52.230,近几日,,,
00:40:52.560,00:40:54.230,这浣碧姑娘的脾气倒见长了,00:40:52.600,00:40:55.000,Jade has been volatile in her tempers lately.
00:40:55.720,00:40:57.190,小主在家时就多让着她,,,
00:40:57.600,00:40:58.550,宠得跟二小姐似的,00:40:57.000,00:40:59.860,"Jade was spoiled by My Lady at home.
She was treated like her sister."
00:40:58.960,00:41:00.470,这几日又时常犯懒,,,
00:41:00.840,00:41:01.820,老是不知道去哪儿了,00:41:00.000,00:41:01.500,She's been working lazily these days.
00:41:02.520,00:41:04.390,回头我跟小主说说她,00:41:01.500,00:41:03.820,I can't find her sometimes.
00:41:04.720,00:41:05.510,姑姑别往心里去,00:41:04.000,00:41:05.600,I will let My Lady know about her misbehavior.
00:41:05.800,00:41:06.510,不必,00:41:05.600,00:41:07.120,"Madam, please don't take it personally."
00:41:06.880,00:41:08.790,我不过是随便说说而已 你去吧,00:41:07.240,00:41:09.880,"It's all right.
I didn't really mind. You can go."
00:41:10.960,00:41:11.750,我有话要问你,00:41:10.000,00:41:11.000,Yes.
00:41:12.640,00:41:13.860,陵容又没有得罪你,00:41:12.000,00:41:13.840,I need to ask you something.
00:41:14.880,00:41:15.990,你为何每每都要摆脸子,00:41:13.900,00:41:15.600,Lingrong didn't offend you.
00:41:16.320,00:41:17.190,给人家瞧呢,00:41:15.780,00:41:18.180,Why do you always treat her this way?
00:41:17.600,00:41:19.470,小主不觉得她是小人得志,,,
00:41:19.880,00:41:21.630,飞上枝头就显摆给咱们看吗,00:41:18.400,00:41:23.000,"My Lady, don't you think that snob is trying to show off?"
00:41:22.280,00:41:23.910,一会儿是苏州的浮光锦,,,
00:41:24.320,00:41:26.350,一会儿又是皇上新赏的宝石簪子,00:41:23.400,00:41:27.000,She came here wearing her glinting dress and glittering hairpins.
00:41:26.720,00:41:27.470,好像我们没见过似的,,,
00:41:27.680,00:41:28.470,住口,00:41:27.000,00:41:28.600,As if we'd never seen such things before!
00:41:29.000,00:41:29.750,我不过问你一句,00:41:28.600,00:41:29.600,Stop!
00:41:30.200,00:41:31.070,你就怨声载道的,00:41:29.600,00:41:32.820,"I simply asked you one question
and you filled my room with complaints."
00:41:32.120,00:41:33.590,她是皇上的新宠,,,
00:41:34.200,00:41:35.550,皇上给些什么赏些什么,00:41:33.200,00:41:35.140,She is the new favorite of His Majesty.
00:41:35.960,00:41:37.020,她难道还要藏着掖着,00:41:35.380,00:41:39.060,Do you think she should hide the rewards in her pockets?
00:41:38.240,00:41:39.630,从前有什么好东西,,,
00:41:39.960,00:41:42.260,不都是小主赏的吗 有什么呀,00:41:39.480,00:41:42.420,"But My Lady, she was always receiving gifts from you."
00:41:42.600,00:41:43.390,不管她有什么,00:41:42.540,00:41:43.640,Look what she has now ...
00:41:43.800,00:41:45.020,她都是皇上的妃嫔,00:41:43.640,00:41:46.940,"No matter what she has,
she is a concubine of His Majesty."
00:41:46.200,00:41:47.390,你要记住自己的身份,,,
00:41:47.720,00:41:48.470,不要惹事,00:41:47.100,00:41:48.400,Remember your status.
00:41:50.680,00:41:51.350,是,00:41:48.400,00:41:50.000,Don't look for trouble!
00:41:53.880,00:41:55.390,你就好使这点小性子,00:41:51.500,00:41:53.440,I understand.
00:41:57.400,00:41:59.110,陵容给了我两件浮光锦的衣裳,00:41:54.800,00:41:57.540,You must stop being petulant.
00:41:59.800,00:42:00.830,我留了一件给你,00:41:58.400,00:42:02.120,I saved one of the dresses made of Glinting Satin for you.
00:42:01.600,00:42:03.470,记得 别穿得太招摇,00:42:02.600,00:42:04.580,Remember not to flaunt it.

00:42:11.840,00:42:13.060,这会儿子倒想吃了,00:42:10.080,00:42:14.340,"The Imperial Kitchen made some water chestnut cakes.
I'm craving one."
00:42:13.440,00:42:14.270,我这就去给小主拿,00:42:14.400,00:42:17.180,"I'll bring it here immediately, My Lady!"
