00:02:22.160,00:02:24.710,浣碧姐姐 您这身衣裳真好看,,,
00:02:25.000,00:02:26.190,方才在御膳房里,00:02:24.460,00:02:26.580,"Jade, you look gorgeous in this dress."
00:02:26.400,00:02:27.870,那些太监都看呆了呢,,,
00:02:28.480,00:02:30.750,我这身衣服和陵容小主是一样的,00:02:27.460,00:02:29.780,The eunuchs were stunned at the Imperial Kitchen.
00:02:31.240,00:02:33.310,是苏州进贡的浮光锦,00:02:31.040,00:02:32.700,This dress is the same as Lingrong's.
00:02:33.880,00:02:35.990,说起小主还是最疼姐姐了,00:02:33.600,00:02:35.600,It is the tributary Glinting Satin from Suzhou Province.
00:02:36.320,00:02:38.470,有什么好东西都留给姐姐一份,00:02:36.220,00:02:38.220,My Lady cares about you the most.
00:02:41.080,00:02:43.870,你说这身衣服是我穿着好看,00:02:38.360,00:02:40.360,She shares all the good things with you.
00:02:44.120,00:02:45.590,还是陵容小主穿着好看,00:02:43.320,00:02:47.340,Do you think I look more beautiful in this dress than Lingrong?
00:02:46.280,00:02:47.430,原是差不多的,,,
00:02:47.800,00:02:50.070,不过姐姐这对耳环更出众,00:02:48.640,00:02:49.860,The dress is equally beautiful.
00:02:50.360,00:02:51.390,是小主刚给的吧,00:02:49.980,00:02:51.940,But your earrings make you stand out
00:02:52.240,00:02:54.070,她原就是穷门小户出身,00:02:52.120,00:02:54.120,"They are the new gift from My Lady, aren't they?"
00:02:54.280,00:02:56.790,再好的料子用在她身上也是白费,00:02:54.700,00:02:56.360,Lingrong comes from a poor family.
00:02:57.320,00:02:59.710,那奴婢去采 小主当心脚下,00:02:56.360,00:02:58.500,Even the best satin is a waste on her.
00:03:01.680,00:03:02.630,小主您看,00:02:59.900,00:03:01.900,I will do the picking.
00:03:03.800,00:03:05.030,什么大惊小怪的,00:03:04.120,00:03:05.160,"My Lady, look!"
00:03:06.000,00:03:08.990,小主您瞧 浣碧穿的那套衣服,00:03:05.900,00:03:07.260,What's so surprising?
00:03:09.600,00:03:10.830,是不是您送给莞贵人的,00:03:07.920,00:03:13.900,"My Lady, is Jade wearing the dress
made of Glinting Satin that you gave to Lady Sourire?"
00:03:11.160,00:03:12.110,那套浮光锦,,,
00:03:14.320,00:03:15.070,果然是,,,
00:03:16.360,00:03:18.310,莞贵人也忒大方了,00:03:16.120,00:03:18.120,She is.
00:03:18.560,00:03:19.630,那么好的料子,00:03:18.400,00:03:20.400,Lady Sourire is very generous.
00:03:19.960,00:03:21.590,小主您自己都舍不得穿,,,
00:03:21.920,00:03:23.150,留了两件给她,00:03:20.860,00:03:25.380,"You would not even use such fine satin for yourself
and saved two pieces for her."
00:03:23.600,00:03:26.110,她倒好拿来打赏给下人了,,,
00:03:26.960,00:03:27.790,不许胡说,00:03:25.580,00:03:28.220,But she ... She gave it away to her maids?
00:03:30.840,00:03:32.470,浣碧是姐姐的陪嫁丫头,00:03:29.160,00:03:30.440,Don't speak like that.
00:03:33.440,00:03:36.230,她素日的穿戴也比别人好些,00:03:33.000,00:03:35.662,Jade is Sourire's dowry maid.
00:03:37.040,00:03:38.590,她不爱穿戴也就罢了,00:03:35.662,00:03:38.460,She usually wears better clothes than the other maids.
00:03:39.400,00:03:41.830,浣碧她再高贵也是个下人,00:03:39.080,00:03:40.800,"Even if Lady Sourire prefers not to wear it,"
00:03:42.200,00:03:44.790,赏给她那当小主您是什么,00:03:41.040,00:03:43.860,Jade is a servant after all.
,,,00:03:44.380,00:03:48.240,"What does it say about you
if Lady Sourire gives the dress to her maid?"
00:04:01.040,00:04:01.750,好香的味,,,
00:04:02.760,00:04:03.670,你怎么才回来,00:04:02.800,00:04:04.380,Smells delicious.
00:04:04.760,00:04:06.470,拿一些马蹄糕倒是容易,00:04:04.800,00:04:06.220,The errand took longer today.
00:04:06.760,00:04:08.870,只是看见御膳房有木薯粉,00:04:06.680,00:04:08.780,It didn't take long to get the water chestnut cakes.
00:04:09.120,00:04:10.310,就顺道拿了些过来,00:04:08.780,00:04:12.340,But I also took some cassava starch from the Imperial Kitchen.
00:04:10.920,00:04:12.510,想到夜里做珍珠丸子,,,
00:04:12.720,00:04:13.710,给小主当宵夜,,,
00:04:14.000,00:04:14.910,难为你想着了,00:04:13.400,00:04:15.660,I was thinking of making tapioca pearls as your dessert tonight.
00:04:20.920,00:04:22.630,自从安常在得宠,00:04:16.040,00:04:17.840,Thanks for thinking of me.
00:04:23.000,00:04:24.790,皇上也松泛了些,00:04:22.700,00:04:26.720,"With Attendant An, His Majesty became more relaxed at work."
00:04:25.280,00:04:26.790,从前皇上一批折子,,,
00:04:27.120,00:04:28.350,就是六七个时辰,,,
00:04:28.600,00:04:30.230,也不知道停下来歇息,00:04:27.460,00:04:32.220,"His Majesty used to work over 12 hours without a break.
[Emperor Yongzheng was one of the most diligent emperors]"
00:04:31.080,00:04:32.630,皇上听歌曲子放松些,,,
00:04:33.000,00:04:33.870,也是应当的,,,
00:04:34.160,00:04:37.510,你倒是懂事不比那华妃小性子,00:04:33.200,00:04:36.160,I'm glad His Majesty can be relaxed by her singing.
00:04:39.480,00:04:40.230,来,00:04:36.300,00:04:39.780,"You are very understanding, unlike the pettish Consort Fleur."
00:04:42.200,00:04:43.950,别怕只是只猫而已,00:04:41.580,00:04:43.580,Come here.
00:04:46.400,00:04:48.230,听说波斯进贡了一只猫,00:04:44.280,00:04:47.600,"Don't be scared, it's just a cat."
00:04:48.880,00:04:50.270,皇上赏给了三阿哥,,,
00:04:50.480,00:04:51.470,就是这只啊,00:04:48.500,00:04:52.900,"I heard that His Majesty received a cat from Persia ...
and rewarded it to the Third Prince."
00:04:52.160,00:04:53.310,三阿哥孝心,00:04:52.900,00:04:53.960,This is the cat.
00:04:53.520,00:04:55.190,知道齐妃喜欢养猫,,,
00:04:55.480,00:04:56.710,便送给了齐妃,00:04:54.000,00:04:58.660,"The Third Prince is a filial son.
He knows Consort Astuce is very fond of cats."
00:04:56.960,00:04:58.630,谁知那日齐妃抱了来,,,
00:04:58.920,00:05:00.350,倒是合本宫的眼缘,,,
00:05:01.120,00:05:03.430,齐妃便转赠给本宫了,00:04:59.020,00:05:02.720,"But when Consort Astuce brought the cat to me,
he sparked adoration by first sight."
00:05:04.240,00:05:06.630,本宫给它起了个名字 叫松子,00:05:03.140,00:05:05.900,So she gave him to me.
00:05:07.640,00:05:08.430,挺漂亮的,00:05:06.320,00:05:08.920,"I named him ""Pine Nut""."
00:05:09.440,00:05:10.390,你来抱抱,00:05:09.460,00:05:11.220,Pine Nut is very pretty.
00:05:12.760,00:05:14.870,本宫忘了你怕猫的,00:05:11.320,00:05:13.080,Would you like to hold him?
00:05:16.240,00:05:17.430,皇后关怀臣妾,00:05:15.040,00:05:18.220,I forgot that you are afraid of cats.
00:05:17.760,00:05:19.510,这等微末小事也放在心上,00:05:18.520,00:05:22.140,"It is very considerate of Your Majesty to
have remembered such a small thing."
00:05:21.200,00:05:22.270,来呀 坐,,,
00:05:26.520,00:05:28.470,其实本宫虽然很喜欢它,00:05:23.240,00:05:25.520,"Come, sit down."
00:05:28.760,00:05:30.510,却也得时时处处小心着,00:05:28.460,00:05:33.140,"Although I'm very fond of Pine Nut,
I always have to keep an eye on him."
00:05:31.440,00:05:32.750,毕竟是畜生,,,
00:05:32.960,00:05:35.510,万一不小心被它咬着伤了自己,,,
00:05:35.760,00:05:36.670,就不好了,00:05:33.520,00:05:38.600,"After all, any animal might bite no matter how tame it is."
00:05:36.920,00:05:37.990,皇后娘娘多虑了,,,
00:05:38.560,00:05:40.390,松子是您一手抚养的,00:05:38.840,00:05:40.480,Your Majesty must not worry about it.
00:05:40.840,00:05:41.750,很是温驯呢,,,
00:05:42.280,00:05:43.110,是么,00:05:40.600,00:05:43.980,Pine Nut is trained by Your Majesty and is very docile.
00:05:43.800,00:05:46.270,不过人心都难测何况是畜类,00:05:44.260,00:05:45.740,Is that so?
00:05:48.960,00:05:52.630,越是亲近温驯越就容易不留神哪,00:05:45.920,00:05:48.940,But an animal is even more unpredictable than a person.
,,,00:05:50.900,00:05:55.760,We might be careless when we are too close with them.
00:05:57.360,00:05:58.590,今夜是七夕,,,
00:05:58.840,00:06:00.910,皇上邀了各家王爷与宫中妃嫔,00:05:58.800,00:06:01.340,"Today is the Qixi Festival
[Chinese Valentine's Day, lunar July 7th]"
00:06:01.200,00:06:03.030,一同到畅春园去赏月,,,
00:06:03.560,00:06:04.590,你可别迟了,00:06:01.380,00:06:05.580,"His Majesty invited the concubines and the lords
to admire the moon at the Garden of Vibrant Spring."
00:06:05.680,00:06:06.270,是,00:06:05.640,00:06:07.120,Don't be late.
00:06:08.960,00:06:10.190,今日是七夕,00:06:07.540,00:06:08.560,Yes.
00:06:10.440,00:06:12.910,臣妾祝皇上皇后恩爱长久,00:06:10.560,00:06:12.220,"On the night of Qixi,"
00:06:13.280,00:06:14.230,万福万寿,00:06:12.280,00:06:16.520,I wish Your Majesties everlasting love and happiness.
00:06:26.360,00:06:29.550,安常州在真是难得,00:06:28.200,00:06:31.840,Aiyo ... How caring Attendant An is!
00:06:30.720,00:06:33.550,这让咱们做姐姐的都忘记了,,,
00:06:36.080,00:06:37.390,真是惭愧呀,00:06:32.460,00:06:39.280,It's a shame that we elder concubines forgot to propose a toast.
00:06:38.800,00:06:41.350,朕瞧着你桌上的葡萄是贡品,,,
00:06:41.960,00:06:43.030,不如拿来给朕吧,00:06:40.920,00:06:45.480,"I see you are having some tributary grapes.
You should bring them to me."
00:06:44.640,00:06:45.390,是,,,
00:06:48.560,00:06:50.310,皇上您自己也有啊,00:06:46.580,00:06:48.240,Yes.
00:06:50.880,00:06:52.630,为何要臣妾的呢,00:06:50.340,00:06:53.140,But Your Majesty ... you have the same grapes as well.
00:06:52.880,00:06:54.390,朕瞧你不顾着吃,00:06:53.140,00:06:54.880,Why do you want mine?
00:06:54.960,00:06:56.190,一个劲儿地说话,,,
00:06:56.520,00:06:58.790,不如给朕免得白白放着,00:06:54.940,00:06:58.360,They will be wasted if you keep talking instead of eating them.
00:07:03.240,00:07:06.710,皇上就是爱取笑臣妾,00:06:58.360,00:07:01.220,I'd better eat them for you.
00:07:07.400,00:07:09.030,齐妃此话差矣,00:07:05.340,00:07:09.160,Your Majesty always jokes with me.
00:07:09.400,00:07:10.230,皇上近日,00:07:09.400,00:07:11.160,"That's incorrect, Consort Astuce."
00:07:10.480,00:07:12.310,明明只喜欢跟安常在说笑,,,
00:07:12.840,00:07:14.910,怎的你偏要往自己身上扯啊,00:07:11.160,00:07:14.380,His Majesty only banters with Attendant An lately.
00:07:15.560,00:07:16.830,让旁人听了,00:07:14.380,00:07:17.000,Don't make this about you.
00:07:17.320,00:07:19.510,还以为你是要沾安常在的光呢,00:07:17.620,00:07:21.560,People would say that you are stealing Attendant An's glory.
00:07:25.200,00:07:26.510,嫔妾才疏德浅,,,
00:07:27.240,00:07:28.870,凡事还请娘娘多赐教,00:07:27.180,00:07:31.440,"I am always appreciative when Your Highness has
any advice for my shallow talent and dull mind."
00:07:29.600,00:07:30.950,也敬华妃娘娘一杯,00:07:31.500,00:07:33.800,May I make a toast to Your Highness?
00:07:46.160,00:07:48.470,到底是华妃宽宏大度,00:07:48.140,00:07:52.120,"Consort Fleur has a big heart
[to accept the toast from a lower concubine]"""
00:08:01.160,00:08:02.710,我有些醉了 想出去走走,,,
00:08:04.160,00:08:06.830,我第一次来畅春园不熟悉路,00:08:03.040,00:08:05.920,I'm a little drunk. I need some fresh air.
00:08:07.200,00:08:09.190,还是请槿汐姑姑陪小主过去吧,00:08:05.980,00:08:08.900,I'm not familiar with the garden.
,,,00:08:08.900,00:08:12.240,"May I trouble you to accompany My Lady, Madam?"
00:08:13.560,00:08:15.710,皇上臣妾敬您,00:08:15.420,00:08:18.480,"Your Majesty, here's to you."
00:08:26.120,00:08:27.270,这里好幽静啊,,,
00:08:29.040,00:08:30.150,这畅春园哪,00:08:27.980,00:08:30.680,The garden is so quiet and secluded.
00:08:30.760,00:08:33.030,本是康熙先帝最爱来的行宫,00:08:31.020,00:08:35.720,"The Garden of Vibrant Spring was
the prior emperor Kangxi's favorite palace."
00:08:33.840,00:08:36.390,先帝去世以后自然就冷清多了,,,
00:08:38.760,00:08:41.430,你看前面就是桐花台了,00:08:35.980,00:08:39.420,It has been rarely visited since he passed away.
00:08:42.960,00:08:44.390,小主愿意出来走走,00:08:40.440,00:08:44.560,"Look, that is Tung Blossoms Terrace."
00:08:44.760,00:08:47.510,宫中夜宴近处总是嘈杂的,00:08:44.920,00:08:48.774,"My Lady, if you would like to avoid the bustling banquet,"
00:08:47.800,00:08:49.110,咱不妨前去看看,,,
00:08:49.920,00:08:50.990,桐花台,00:08:48.780,00:08:52.080,we might as well visit the terrace.
00:08:52.720,00:08:54.990,宫中难得有这样别致清丽的名字,00:08:52.220,00:08:54.280,Tung Blossoms Terrace?
00:08:55.840,00:08:56.910,我先前听说,00:08:54.280,00:08:57.920,What a graceful name!
00:08:57.320,00:09:00.230,这梧桐啊 是最贞节恩爱的树木,00:08:58.240,00:09:02.360,"I heard that the Tung trees represent
the purest and most faithful love."
00:09:01.120,00:09:04.990,所以此台是先帝爷专为舒妃所建,00:09:03.040,00:09:07.840,The prior emperor built the terrace for Consort Serein.
00:09:06.640,00:09:08.190,只可惜那个舒妃啊,00:09:07.840,00:09:08.740,(sign)
00:09:09.480,00:09:12.550,在先帝那一朝那是受尽恩宠,00:09:08.740,00:09:14.860,"Unfortunately, although Consort Serein
was loved exclusively for so many years,"
00:09:13.120,00:09:17.670,而今却出居道家实在可叹,00:09:15.080,00:09:18.920,she is now living in a Taoist temple.
00:09:20.400,00:09:21.790,怎么如此荒凉,00:09:19.020,00:09:21.020,What a shame!
00:09:23.080,00:09:24.230,皇上登基后,00:09:22.220,00:09:24.880,What a deserted place!
00:09:24.520,00:09:26.550,太后嫌弃桐花台太过奢靡,,,
00:09:27.160,00:09:29.630,加之平日甚少有人来,00:09:25.220,00:09:29.080,"After His Majesty's coronation, the Empress Dowager
was critical of the terrace's extravagance."
00:09:30.000,00:09:31.310,渐渐就荒废了,00:09:29.440,00:09:34.120,The terrace was gradually abandoned since it was rarely visited.
00:09:33.040,00:09:34.590,再美再好的情事,,,
00:09:35.000,00:09:36.590,也不过浮云一瞬间,00:09:34.840,00:09:39.260,"Even the most beautiful love could only
last as long as the floating clouds."
00:09:37.560,00:09:38.790,桐花台如此,,,
00:09:39.360,00:09:42.030,先帝与舒妃的情爱又何尝不是呢,00:09:39.500,00:09:44.420,"The love between the prior emperor and Consort Serein
lasted as briefly as the Tung Blossoms Terrace."
00:09:42.880,00:09:43.870,是啊,,,
00:09:46.080,00:09:47.830,你在此留候我上去看看,00:09:44.780,00:09:46.540,I agree.
,,,00:09:47.980,00:09:51.820,"Please wait here.
I will go up to the terrace."
00:09:51.560,00:09:52.590,可要小心哪,00:09:53.440,00:09:55.660,You must be careful!
00:10:01.680,00:10:03.190,桐花台,00:10:04.000,00:10:07.900,(Reading the plaque) Tung Blossoms Terrace
00:10:19.040,00:10:20.150,你不知道那是什么花吗,,,
00:10:20.320,00:10:21.110,谁,00:10:20.880,00:10:22.520,Do you not know what flower that is?
00:10:21.960,00:10:23.590,怎么莞贵人每次看到小王,00:10:22.520,00:10:23.760,Who is it?
00:10:23.920,00:10:25.350,都要问谁,,,
00:10:26.680,00:10:27.830,看来小王的长相,00:10:24.280,00:10:28.000,"Lady Sourire always asks ""who is it"" when she sees me."
00:10:28.320,00:10:30.230,的确难以让人有深刻的印象,,,
00:10:30.800,00:10:32.830,王爷每次都爱在人身后突然出现,00:10:28.440,00:10:32.900,I believe my face is not very memorable.
00:10:33.760,00:10:34.750,难免叫人惊惶,,,
00:10:35.360,00:10:37.190,是莞贵人走到小王身前,00:10:32.900,00:10:37.140,"Your Lordship always appears from behind.
I couldn't help being startled."
00:10:37.640,00:10:38.750,而未发觉小王,,,
00:10:39.160,00:10:41.590,实非小王爱藏身莞贵人身后,00:10:37.140,00:10:41.140,"Nay, it was Lady Sourire who
walked towards me and didn't see me."
00:10:42.240,00:10:44.630,桐花台树木葱郁许是我失察,00:10:41.140,00:10:44.420,I had no reason to be hiding behind you.
00:10:45.200,00:10:47.630,可是王爷怎不早点出声呢,00:10:44.420,00:10:47.320,"I might have failed to notice
due to the lush plantings on the terrace."
00:10:50.000,00:10:52.190,小王今日见贵人大有愁态,00:10:47.320,00:10:50.340,But why didn't Your Lordship make a sound?
00:10:52.720,00:10:53.550,不似往日,,,
00:10:54.120,00:10:55.750,所以不敢冒昧惊扰,00:10:51.720,00:10:56.240,I saw you were not as happy as the other day.
00:10:56.720,00:10:58.830,不想还是吓着莞贵人了,00:10:56.240,00:10:58.760,So I dared not disturb you.
00:10:59.360,00:11:00.630,实非允礼所愿,,,
00:11:02.160,00:11:04.750,只是薄醉多谢王爷关怀,00:10:58.800,00:11:03.580,It wasn't my intention to startle you.
00:11:05.920,00:11:07.350,宫中夜宴欢聚,00:11:04.200,00:11:08.000,"I was slightly drunk.
I thank Your Lordship for your concern."
00:11:08.240,00:11:09.310,莞贵人怎么出来了,,,
00:11:10.960,00:11:12.070,今夜是七夕,00:11:08.000,00:11:12.240,Why did you leave the banquet?
00:11:12.400,00:11:14.190,自然是月色更动人了,00:11:12.840,00:11:17.080,"On the night of Qixi, the moon is more worthy of my time."
00:11:16.360,00:11:17.110,正是,,,
00:11:18.760,00:11:20.750,金风玉露一相逢,00:11:17.660,00:11:20.060,"Mm, exactly."
00:11:21.720,00:11:23.430,更胜人间无数,00:11:20.260,00:11:26.700,"""When the jade-green dew meets the golden wind,
their love surpasses innumerable beneath."""
00:11:24.400,00:11:27.510,如将此良夜奉与觥筹交错,,,
00:11:28.000,00:11:29.070,实在是浪费了,00:11:26.820,00:11:31.880,"It would be such a waste to
give the night away to the clinking of goblets."
00:11:30.760,00:11:31.910,如王爷所说,,,
00:11:32.440,00:11:33.990,我倒侥幸风雅一回了,00:11:32.720,00:11:36.780,"Like Your Lordship said,
I am fortunate to enjoy bardic pursuits."
00:11:35.880,00:11:38.990,莞贵人似乎很喜欢台角的小花,00:11:38.060,00:11:41.880,You seem to be fond of the flowers on the railings.
00:11:40.480,00:11:41.190,确实,,,
00:11:42.160,00:11:43.790,儿时在野外田间常见,00:11:42.000,00:11:43.860,I am.
00:11:44.160,00:11:45.270,名叫牵牛花,,,
00:11:46.440,00:11:48.150,此花在宫中甚少见到,00:11:44.000,00:11:48.100,"They are morning glories, commonly seen in the countryside."
00:11:48.520,00:11:49.830,反而更显别致了,,,
00:11:50.480,00:11:54.030,这花还有一别名 叫夕颜,00:11:48.320,00:11:52.480,But their rareness in the palace makes them delightfully unique.
00:11:54.880,00:11:56.550,的确不该是宫中所有,00:11:52.500,00:11:56.480,"The flower is also called ""the face of eventide""."
00:11:57.000,00:12:00.470,薄命之花宫中的人是不会栽植的,00:11:56.500,00:12:03.080,"It shouldn't be in the palace indeed.
The palace does not grow ill-fated flowers."
00:12:01.560,00:12:02.750,花朵也有薄命吗,,,
00:12:03.680,00:12:05.550,我以为只有女子才称薄命呢,00:12:03.420,00:12:05.620,Do flowers have an ill fate?
00:12:07.320,00:12:10.790,人云 此花卑贱只开墙角,00:12:05.620,00:12:08.800,I thought only women are said to have a hapless fate.
00:12:11.080,00:12:13.070,黄昏盛开明晨凋谢,00:12:08.860,00:12:13.100,They say it's such a lowly creature to grow in the corners.
00:12:13.600,00:12:16.110,无人欣赏故有此说,00:12:13.240,00:12:18.600,"It blooms at dusk and withers at dawn,
never to be seen by anyone."
00:12:16.640,00:12:17.830,如此便称薄命吗,,,
00:12:19.240,00:12:21.190,我倒觉得此花甚是与众不同,00:12:18.740,00:12:20.920,Is that considered ill-fated?
00:12:22.240,00:12:23.230,夕颜,00:12:21.420,00:12:24.080,I think the flower is out of the ordinary.
00:12:23.920,00:12:26.310,是夕阳下美好容颜的意思吧,00:12:24.080,00:12:28.840,"""The face of eventide"" — they are
the beautiful faces under the setting sun."
00:12:28.720,00:12:30.070,王爷也是这样觉得,,,
00:12:31.200,00:12:33.310,只是不愿意将如此清丽之花,00:12:30.200,00:12:33.140,Does Your Lordship agree?
00:12:33.960,00:12:35.230,想得过于薄命罢了,00:12:33.140,00:12:38.480,We just wouldn't believe such a beautiful flower denotes misfortune.
00:12:42.560,00:12:43.430,莞贵人呢,,,
00:12:45.640,00:12:46.470,回禀皇上,00:12:44.500,00:12:46.260,Where is Lady Sourire?
00:12:46.840,00:12:49.190,小主酒醉去偏殿更衣了,00:12:47.000,00:12:52.360,"Your Majesty, My Lady had a little too much to drink and
went to get changed in the side chamber [= powder her nose]."
00:12:51.200,00:12:52.910,莞姐姐向来不胜酒力,,,
00:12:53.160,00:12:54.390,不比皇上海量,00:12:53.120,00:12:57.140,"Sourie is a light drinker.
She can't compare with Your Majesty."
00:12:58.320,00:12:59.630,天家富贵之夜,,,
00:13:01.080,00:13:02.870,贵人各小王避世于此,,,
00:13:03.480,00:13:04.790,倒显得不合时宜了,00:13:00.260,00:13:07.300,"On a night for imperial opulence, it seems
inappropriate that we choose to seclude ourselves."
00:13:05.800,00:13:06.790,我一向短视,,,
00:13:07.480,00:13:09.510,眼前只见小小夕颜而已,,,
00:13:10.880,00:13:13.390,听闻皇史身边的安常州在,00:13:07.920,00:13:12.480,"I'm a short-sighted person.
All I see is the ""face of eventide"" tonight."
00:13:14.000,00:13:15.070,是贵人引荐的,,,
00:13:16.640,00:13:18.510,贵人伤感是否为她,00:13:13.040,00:13:18.480,I heard that you presented Attendant An to His Majesty.
00:13:21.080,00:13:22.870,宫中姐妹无分彼此,00:13:18.740,00:13:22.580,Were you unhappy because of her?
00:13:24.280,00:13:25.310,王爷见笑了,,,
00:13:25.840,00:13:27.510,其实有人分宠也是好事,00:13:23.100,00:13:27.960,"We are sisters in the palace.
I hope I did not incur ridicule by Your Lordship."
00:13:28.840,00:13:30.990,若是莞贵人集三千宠爱于一身,00:13:28.060,00:13:30.600,"In fact, it's good to have someone
to share His Majesty's favor with."
00:13:31.640,00:13:33.270,而成为六宫怨恨所在,,,
00:13:34.320,00:13:36.350,小王真当为贵人一哭啊,00:13:30.940,00:13:39.000,"I would lament for you if all the other concubines
resented you for being exclusively beloved."
00:13:37.640,00:13:38.510,多谢王爷,,,
00:13:39.240,00:13:40.310,贵人冰雪聪明,00:13:39.060,00:13:40.940,I thank Your Lordship.
00:13:40.560,00:13:41.910,小王所言也是多余,,,
00:13:42.680,00:13:44.190,只是小王冷眼旁观,00:13:41.180,00:13:44.520,"Lady Sourire has a brilliant mind.
I shouldn't have needed to say anything."
00:13:44.600,00:13:46.830,发现贵人似乎有走入迷局之象,00:13:44.920,00:13:49.320,"But watching from the sidelines, I see
you might be walking into a morass."
00:13:47.400,00:13:49.510,所以多言一句,,,
00:13:50.360,00:13:52.790,王爷多言 难能可贵,00:13:49.320,00:13:52.200,That is why I chose to say the needless words.
00:13:53.640,00:13:55.030,皇兄是一国之君,00:13:52.440,00:13:55.460,Your Lordship's words are most appreciated.
00:13:55.720,00:13:57.390,做有些事情也是无奈,00:13:55.620,00:14:00.300,"As the emperor, my brother doesn't have a choice for everything."
00:13:58.840,00:14:00.590,还望贵人多体谅皇兄,,,
00:14:02.440,00:14:04.070,其实小王很庆幸自己,00:14:00.480,00:14:03.580,I hope you will understand him.
00:14:04.520,00:14:05.670,并非帝王之身,00:14:04.160,00:14:08.340,I'm glad that I'm not one to wear the imperial mantle.
00:14:07.040,00:14:10.070,许多无奈烦扰不必牵萦于身,00:14:08.580,00:14:13.300,"I'm not to be entangled in the
dilemmas and apprehensions."
00:14:13.200,00:14:14.870,王爷美名遍天下,,,
00:14:15.640,00:14:18.150,恐怕是许多女子的春闺梦里人呢,00:14:15.260,00:14:21.320,"Your Lordship's good name has been widely heard of.
You must be the man of many girls' dreams."
00:14:21.400,00:14:22.590,允礼不敢贪心,,,
00:14:23.160,00:14:25.310,只望有一位心上人可以相伴,,,
00:14:26.080,00:14:28.470,不求娇妻美妾如云,00:14:23.600,00:14:27.860,"I dare not be greedy.
I only wish for one lady to spend my life with"
00:14:29.720,00:14:30.630,说来容易,00:14:28.260,00:14:31.620,instead of a cloud of concubines.
00:14:33.640,00:14:34.910,贵人不信小王所言,00:14:31.620,00:14:34.840,That is easier said than done.
00:14:35.840,00:14:36.870,小王私下以为,00:14:35.520,00:14:38.040,Lady Sourie seems unable to believe me?
00:14:37.360,00:14:38.670,如果真心对待一人,,,
00:14:39.200,00:14:40.790,必定要对其爱护有加,,,
00:14:41.560,00:14:44.430,不要使其心伤一丝一毫,00:14:38.040,00:14:47.680,"In my view, I must care for the person I love
so much so that she will not be unhappy in the least."
00:14:48.280,00:14:49.750,果如王爷所言,,,
00:14:50.200,00:14:52.030,乃是将来十七福晋之幸,,,
00:14:54.040,00:14:56.750,王爷今日所言对我实有裨益,00:14:50.160,00:14:55.720,"If so, the future Lady XVII is very fortunate."
00:14:57.200,00:14:58.310,贵人不必言谢,00:14:56.020,00:14:59.140,Your Lordship's advice is truly beneficial to me.
00:14:59.200,00:15:01.630,我只是不希望皇史过于宠爱贵人,00:14:59.200,00:15:01.220,"You need not thank me, Lady Sourire."
00:15:03.080,00:15:06.030,使贵人终有一日步上我额娘后尘,00:15:01.220,00:15:04.840,"I simply hope that you won't be overly favored,"
00:15:07.040,00:15:09.070,长伴青灯古佛,00:15:05.200,00:15:12.680,"following the footsteps of my mother
to a lonesome lamp in the temple."
00:15:13.240,00:15:15.670,帝王少有情爱,,,
00:15:16.680,00:15:19.430,若有也是不能见光,00:15:15.260,00:15:18.620,Love is a rarity for the emperors and lords.
00:15:19.680,00:15:21.390,不被世人所接受的事情,00:15:18.740,00:15:24.400,"Their love, if any, can never be brought to light."
00:15:22.880,00:15:26.510,就像是那夕颜只开一夜的花,00:15:24.780,00:15:30.000,"Just like ""the face of eventide"",
it's the flower that blooms merely for a night."
00:15:29.960,00:15:32.350,出来许久先告辞了,,,
00:15:33.080,00:15:34.190,上次唐突贵人,00:15:31.280,00:15:35.060,"It's been a long time since I left the banquet.
I must go now."
00:15:34.720,00:15:35.950,实非允礼所愿,,,
00:15:37.280,00:15:38.750,温宜公主生辰那日,00:15:35.160,00:15:39.360,"It was not my intention to offend you the other day, My Lady."
00:15:39.400,00:15:41.150,正是额娘当年入宫之时,,,
00:15:42.360,00:15:44.990,我回想旧事一时不能自持,00:15:39.360,00:15:44.080,"Princess Wenyi's birthday is on the same date
when my mother entered the palace."
00:15:45.680,00:15:46.310,失仪了,,,
00:15:47.960,00:15:49.750,不知王爷说的是何时的事,00:15:44.080,00:15:49.420,I was drowning my sorrows and forgot my manners.
00:15:50.280,00:15:51.270,我已经不记得了,00:15:50.020,00:15:54.820,I do not recall what Your Lordship is referring to.
00:15:56.400,00:15:59.630,是我也记不得了,,,
00:16:00.040,00:16:00.790,告辞,00:15:58.440,00:16:01.880,"Yes, I have forgotten as well."
,,,00:16:02.040,00:16:04.660,Goodbye.

00:16:27.040,00:16:28.630,什么事出去这样久,00:16:29.060,00:16:30.760,What took you so long?
00:16:31.680,00:16:34.430,臣妾不胜酒力出去透了透风,00:16:32.140,00:16:36.300,I went out for some fresh air to ease my drunkenness.
00:16:35.360,00:16:38.110,臣妾看到了一种叫夕颜的花,,,
00:16:38.800,00:16:39.830,一时贪看住了,00:16:37.360,00:16:40.020,"I saw a kind of flower called  ""the face of eventide"" ."
00:16:40.120,00:16:42.670,夕颜 那是一种什么花,00:16:40.020,00:16:41.800,I was captivated and lost track of time.
00:16:44.080,00:16:46.990,朕看到庭院里紫薇开得正好,00:16:42.040,00:16:44.960,"The face of eventide?
I have never heard of it."
00:16:47.520,00:16:49.750,朕已命人给你拿过去几盆,00:16:46.140,00:16:49.300,I found the crape myrtles in the garden are in full bloom.
00:16:52.120,00:16:55.110,现在正是紫薇盛放的时节,00:16:49.460,00:16:52.740,I've had a few crape myrtle trees sent to your residence.
00:16:55.560,00:16:56.430,多谢皇上,00:16:53.200,00:16:57.200,"Mm, it is the season for crape myrtle flowers."
00:16:58.800,00:17:01.150,皇上对莞妹妹可真是好啊,00:16:57.400,00:16:59.340,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:01.680,00:17:03.390,皇上对六宫一视同仁,00:17:00.540,00:17:03.320,Your Majesty is so thoughtful for Sourire.
00:17:03.760,00:17:04.790,对姐姐也很好,00:17:03.440,00:17:05.520,His Majesty treats every concubine equally.
00:17:05.600,00:17:06.310,是,00:17:05.580,00:17:07.360,His Majesty is very thoughtful for you as well.
00:17:07.760,00:17:09.190,皇上雨露均沾,00:17:07.440,00:17:08.840,Certainly.
00:17:09.720,00:17:12.070,后宫上至皇后下至嫔妾,,,
00:17:12.320,00:17:13.550,都同被恩泽,00:17:09.880,00:17:15.940,"From Her Majesty to us concubines,
we are graced by His Majesty's impartial favor."
00:17:14.600,00:17:17.390,嫔妾先饮助兴,00:17:16.460,00:17:20.600,I will drink to propose a toast to Your Majesty.
00:17:35.680,00:17:39.070,皇上臣妾有事想先行告退,00:17:37.360,00:17:41.000,I entreat Your Majesty to pardon my leaving.
00:17:39.320,00:17:40.430,什么事这样惊慌,,,
00:17:41.360,00:17:44.630,方才宫女来报说温宜又吐奶了,00:17:41.000,00:17:43.000,What's so urgent?
,,,00:17:43.280,00:17:46.980,I was informed that Wenyi vomited again.
00:17:47.880,00:17:48.830,怎会如此,,,
00:17:49.400,00:17:51.190,不不是已经见好了吗,00:17:49.820,00:17:53.900,"How could that happen?
Her condition has been improving."
00:17:52.480,00:17:53.950,太医来瞧过了吗,,,
00:17:55.320,00:17:57.110,太医前几日已经瞧过了,00:17:54.320,00:17:56.660,Has she seen the doctors?
00:17:57.360,00:17:58.870,说是娘胎里带的弱症,00:17:57.400,00:17:59.060,"Oh, yes, she has."
00:17:59.520,00:18:01.710,加上时气溽热才会这样,00:17:59.200,00:18:01.380,The doctors said she was affected during Cao's pregnancy.
00:18:02.400,00:18:03.830,原本已经见好,00:18:01.380,00:18:04.200,And the sultry weather aggravated her condition.
00:18:04.320,00:18:06.430,不知今日怎么会反复,00:18:04.360,00:18:08.720,"She was getting much better.
I wonder why her symptoms recurred today."
00:18:17.040,00:18:18.670,姐姐不觉得有些蹊跷吗,,,
00:18:20.000,00:18:20.950,你说来听听,00:18:18.640,00:18:20.960,"Sourire, don't you feel it was odd?"
00:18:22.760,00:18:24.910,吐奶乃婴儿常州有之事,00:18:21.080,00:18:24.120,What do you think?
00:18:25.600,00:18:27.550,可温宜公主如此反复,00:18:24.840,00:18:29.960,"Although vomiting is common for babies,
Wenyi's symptoms have persisted for such a long time."
00:18:28.200,00:18:29.390,若说是暑热,,,
00:18:30.160,00:18:32.510,温宜公主住在华妃的清凉殿,00:18:30.120,00:18:35.060,"If you think it's because of the summer heat,
Wenyi lives in Consort Fleur's Cooling Hall."
00:18:33.400,00:18:35.030,那可是最清凉的所在呀,,,
00:18:36.240,00:18:38.430,似乎从前并未听说温宜公主,00:18:35.060,00:18:37.560,That is the coolest residence in the palace.
00:18:38.760,00:18:39.830,有过吐奶的症状,00:18:37.680,00:18:41.800,"I don't remember hearing about
Princess Wenyi's symptoms before."
00:18:40.360,00:18:41.470,的确来热突然,,,
00:18:43.440,00:18:46.390,或许好好照应便会好转吧,00:18:42.220,00:18:44.980,This is beyond expectance.
00:18:48.160,00:18:50.230,慈母心肠舐犊情深,00:18:45.120,00:18:49.120,I hope she will get better when she's better taken care of.
00:18:51.280,00:18:53.150,但愿曹贵人与华妃,00:18:50.000,00:18:53.080,Lady Cao is a loving mother.
00:18:53.440,00:18:54.750,能好好照顾温宜,00:18:53.300,00:18:57.960,"Let's hope that Lady Cao and Consort Fleur
will take good care of Wenyi."
00:18:56.680,00:18:58.150,姐姐的意思是,,,
00:19:00.840,00:19:02.150,为一己荣宠,00:18:58.680,00:19:05.060,"Are you suggesting that ...
she's using Wenyi to gain favor?"
00:19:04.080,00:19:07.350,身为母亲这样也未免太狠心了吧,00:19:05.940,00:19:10.840,"As a mother, what cruelty it is to do so!"
00:19:09.840,00:19:11.390,我总以为人性本善,,,
00:19:12.680,00:19:14.390,可入宫之后所见所闻,00:19:11.700,00:19:14.400,I always want to believe humans are good by nature.
00:19:14.680,00:19:15.750,天性亦可扭曲,,,
00:19:16.600,00:19:18.470,我倒不能不这样恶心意揣测了,00:19:14.560,00:19:18.340,"But I learned that life in the palace
can distort human nature."
00:19:20.640,00:19:21.950,我听宫人们说,00:19:18.560,00:19:21.960,That is why I have to assume the worst.
00:19:22.320,00:19:23.590,前朝的妃嫔,,,
00:19:23.800,00:19:26.270,常常利用自己襁褓中的子女争宠,00:19:22.780,00:19:30.020,"I heard that many concubines of the prior emperor
used their babies in swaddles to gain favor."
00:19:29.960,00:19:32.510,母亲原本是世间最温柔慈祥的人,,,
00:19:33.280,00:19:35.630,可在这深宫之中为了争荣宠,00:19:32.000,00:19:35.020,A mother should be the kindest person to her child.
00:19:36.000,00:19:37.350,不惜儿女为利器,00:19:35.340,00:19:40.200,"But in the palace, a mother would choose to
gain favor using her child as a weapon."
00:19:38.520,00:19:40.270,自己的儿女尚且如此,,,
00:19:41.040,00:19:42.630,难怪历代为争储位,,,
00:19:43.000,00:19:45.550,而视他人之子为仇敌的比比皆是,00:19:40.480,00:19:47.780,"Mothers could even do this to her own children,
let alone how hostile they were to other imperial heirs."
00:19:47.040,00:19:48.830,姐姐也别只感慨他人了,,,
00:19:49.360,00:19:50.670,姐姐承宠已久,00:19:48.880,00:19:50.920,"Sourire, let's not worry about them."
00:19:50.960,00:19:52.550,也早该有自己的孩子了,00:19:51.020,00:19:54.680,"You have served His Majesty for a long time.
It's time for you to have your own child."
00:19:52.960,00:19:56.390,我没有的时候盼着有,00:19:54.860,00:19:58.480,"Me? When I don't have a child, I'd wish to have one."
00:19:56.800,00:19:59.670,有的时候又难免与人恶心斗纠缠,00:19:58.720,00:20:01.940,But I would face unending rivalries when I have a child
00:20:00.240,00:20:03.550,这有无之间还是听天由命吧,00:20:02.100,00:20:05.300,I shall leave it to fate whether I will have one or not.
00:20:08.920,00:20:11.270,近日常听到有女子唱歌,,,
00:20:11.640,00:20:13.310,声音宛若黄鹂,00:20:10.220,00:20:15.620,I often heard someone singing like a golden oriole recently.
00:20:14.240,00:20:15.670,那应该是安常在,,,
00:20:17.720,00:20:19.230,听着这个声音,00:20:15.880,00:20:18.520,It must be Attendant An.
00:20:20.520,00:20:24.430,让我想起当年纯元皇后在的时候,00:20:20.420,00:20:26.040,Her voice reminds me of Empress Première ...
00:20:28.160,00:20:28.950,娘娘,,,
00:20:32.000,00:20:34.070,娘娘夜来有风,00:20:29.520,00:20:32.160,Your Highness.
00:20:34.560,00:20:36.750,咱们还是早些进去吧,00:20:34.040,00:20:38.500,It's windy at night. We should go inside.
00:20:38.600,00:20:40.510,一个不会生育的女人,,,
00:20:42.160,00:20:45.190,有谁还会在乎她的身体呢,00:20:40.520,00:20:47.500,Who would care about the health of a sterile woman in the palace?
00:20:46.920,00:20:49.670,娘娘您别伤心了,00:20:49.080,00:20:52.220,"Please don't be sad, Your Highness."
00:20:51.320,00:20:53.030,我已经不伤心了,00:20:53.300,00:20:56.020,I don't feel sad anymore.
00:20:55.720,00:20:58.550,我心里只有恨,00:20:57.560,00:21:01.400,There's only hatred in my heart.
00:21:00.640,00:21:01.510,娘娘,,,
00:21:05.680,00:21:07.270,我从没有忘记,00:21:02.500,00:21:04.400,Your Highness.
00:21:08.520,00:21:11.870,当年我怎么被华妃灌下红花,00:21:07.120,00:21:14.480,"I always remember how Consort Fleur
poured boiled safflower into my mouth."
00:21:13.200,00:21:15.150,即使过去了这么多年,,,
00:21:16.680,00:21:18.230,那个药的滋味,,,
00:21:19.200,00:21:22.550,一直都还在我嘴里,00:21:15.260,00:21:25.560,"After so many years, I can still taste it."
00:21:29.320,00:21:32.750,娘娘 娘娘 娘娘,00:21:31.320,00:21:34.360,Your Highness.
00:21:33.880,00:21:36.270,咱们总会有机会的,00:21:35.820,00:21:39.540,We will find a chance.
00:21:41.320,00:21:45.670,我们不仅需要机会还需要人,00:21:43.300,00:21:47.100,"We not only need a chance, but also the right person."
00:21:47.600,00:21:48.990,娘娘的意思是,,,
00:21:50.680,00:21:52.870,当我第一次看见她的脸,00:21:49.500,00:21:52.820,"Your Highness, what do you mean?"
00:21:53.840,00:21:54.830,我就知道,,,
00:21:56.120,00:22:00.110,她日后一定会帮我这个忙,00:21:52.980,00:22:01.900,"When I saw her face for the very first time,
I knew that she would do me the favor in the future."
00:22:06.520,00:22:07.630,不哭不哭,,,
00:22:08.280,00:22:10.590,你看你看这个这个是什么,00:22:07.860,00:22:09.900,"Easy, easy."
00:22:10.840,00:22:12.630,皇上您要的拨浪鼓,00:22:10.100,00:22:12.160,"Look, what's this?"
,,,00:22:12.400,00:22:16.140,"Your Majesty, here's the rattle-drum."
00:22:24.600,00:22:26.270,公主还是不见好啊,,,
00:22:29.320,00:22:30.590,太医无用啊,00:22:26.000,00:22:30.360,The princess doesn't seem to be getting better.
00:22:32.000,00:22:32.830,微臣无能,00:22:31.000,00:22:33.380,The imperial doctors are useless.
00:22:34.280,00:22:36.790,皇上小孩子的病急不来,00:22:33.660,00:22:35.380,I apologize profusely to Your Majesty.
00:22:38.440,00:22:40.510,这几日进的马蹄羹,00:22:35.440,00:22:39.320,"Your Majesty, it takes times for a young child to recover."
00:22:40.920,00:22:42.750,臣妾看公主吃着还香,00:22:40.740,00:22:45.100,"The princess loves to eat the
water chestnut porridge they serve these days."
00:22:43.440,00:22:45.270,不如让他们再准备一些,,,
00:22:45.960,00:22:47.430,大家也好一起尝一尝,00:22:45.340,00:22:49.560,We can ask them to make more so that everyone can have some.
00:22:47.600,00:22:49.590,也好吧正好朕也饿了,00:22:49.700,00:22:53.240,"Very well, I feel hungry too."
00:22:52.440,00:22:53.990,臣妾这就让人吩咐去,00:22:53.540,00:22:57.140,I will inform the kitchen.
00:23:02.400,00:23:05.510,本宫瞧着刚才公主吃着香甜,,,
00:23:05.800,00:23:06.750,应该快好了,00:23:04.400,00:23:09.020,"The princess has a very good appetite.
She will recover soon."
00:23:07.320,00:23:08.990,谢皇后娘娘垂爱,,,
00:23:09.800,00:23:12.230,也是华妃尽心照指之功,00:23:09.400,00:23:11.740,I thank Your Majesty for the caring words.
00:23:12.640,00:23:14.350,这两天她实在辛苦,00:23:11.960,00:23:14.460,Consort Fleur has been taking great care of her.
00:23:18.240,00:23:19.870,小主公主又不好了,00:23:14.620,00:23:17.760,She worked very hard in the past couple of days.
00:23:20.120,00:23:21.110,还是吐奶,00:23:18.700,00:23:22.900,"My Lady, the princess vomited again."
00:23:21.520,00:23:23.510,连适才吃下的马蹄羹也吐出来了,,,
00:23:24.160,00:23:25.150,这是怎么回事,00:23:23.160,00:23:25.900,She vomited the milk and the porridge we fed her.
00:23:25.880,00:23:27.550,治了两天还不见好,,,
00:23:27.840,00:23:28.870,反而更加厉害了,00:23:26.140,00:23:31.540,"How could this happen? She has not been
any better after two days of treatment."
00:23:31.720,00:23:33.790,微臣微臣实在是不知道,00:23:32.760,00:23:35.860,Your Majesty ...  I ... I have no idea.
00:23:35.080,00:23:35.950,照理来说,,,
00:23:36.320,00:23:37.430,婴儿吐奶大多发生在,,,
00:23:37.760,00:23:38.910,出生一两月大的时候,,,
00:23:39.480,00:23:40.830,因幽门细窄所致,00:23:37.080,00:23:43.340,"Vomiting usually occurs when children are
under two months old because of their narrow pylorus."
00:23:41.680,00:23:43.310,如今公主已满周岁,00:23:43.740,00:23:46.840,But the princess is more than one year old.
00:23:46.880,00:23:47.470,无用,,,
00:23:48.360,00:23:49.510,皇上先别生气,00:23:48.440,00:23:50.020,Useless!
00:23:50.080,00:23:52.630,还是赶紧让太医细细察看才是,00:23:50.180,00:23:52.480,"Your Majesty, please don't be angry."
00:23:54.120,00:23:55.310,微臣反复思量,00:23:52.720,00:23:55.580,We should let the doctor make a careful diagnosis.
00:23:55.960,00:23:57.190,公主肠胃不好,,,
00:23:57.440,00:23:58.950,想是服食了伤胃的东西,00:23:55.600,00:24:01.180,"After careful consideration, I believe her
digestive system was upset by a particular food."
00:23:59.320,00:24:00.470,微臣想检看一下,,,
00:24:00.720,00:24:01.830,公主近来吃过的东西,00:24:01.380,00:24:05.620,May I check what the princess has been eating?
00:24:43.320,00:24:47.790,皇上微臣觉得这马蹄羹有问题,00:24:45.500,00:24:50.640,"Your Majesty, there seems to be
something wrong with water chestnut porridge ."
00:24:48.880,00:24:49.710,为求慎重,,,
00:24:50.000,00:24:52.310,请皇上传尝膳的公公来一同分辨,00:24:51.060,00:24:54.860,"It would be prudent to call for the eunuch
who tasted the food before the princess ate."
00:24:57.240,00:24:57.910,小厦子,,,
00:24:58.600,00:24:59.350,奴才在,00:24:58.600,00:25:00.420,Xiao-Xiazi.
,,,00:25:00.500,00:25:02.500,Your Majesty.
00:25:32.960,00:25:35.270,回禀皇上这马蹄羹无毒,00:25:32.800,00:25:35.400,"Your Majesty, the water chestnut porridge is harmless itself."
00:25:35.600,00:25:37.590,只是掺了些木薯粉,00:25:35.720,00:25:39.440,But it contains cassava starch.
00:25:38.080,00:25:40.350,木薯粉那是什么东西,,,
00:25:40.600,00:25:42.550,木薯是南洋进贡的特产,00:25:39.940,00:25:42.300,Cassava starch? What is that?
00:25:42.760,00:25:43.790,磨粉可做点心,,,
00:25:44.040,00:25:45.950,只是根叶有毒须小心处理,00:25:42.540,00:25:45.440,"Cassava is a tribute from the South Sea [Southeast Asia].
Its stem is used for making desserts."
00:25:46.200,00:25:48.510,你的意思是有人下毒了,00:25:45.480,00:25:47.980,"But the roots and leaves are toxic and
must be processed with great caution."
00:25:48.760,00:25:50.110,木薯粉本是无毒,00:25:48.080,00:25:50.600,Do you suggest that the food was poisoned?
00:25:50.520,00:25:51.870,只是婴儿肠胃娇嫩,,,
00:25:52.080,00:25:54.630,吃下木薯粉会刺激肠胃导致呕吐,00:25:50.720,00:25:54.540,"The starch is harmless but it's not recommended for
infants because their stomach is weak."
00:25:54.880,00:25:56.750,长久以往会虚弱而亡,00:25:54.720,00:25:59.400,"It can cause infants to vomit, and die of weakness through continuous consumption."
00:25:57.440,00:25:59.070,而且木薯粉与马蹄粉,,,
00:25:59.360,00:26:00.910,颜色形状皆相似,,,
00:26:01.440,00:26:02.870,混在一起不易发觉,00:25:59.580,00:26:06.100,"Cassava starch looks similar to water chestnut flour,
so it's hard to distinguish when they are mixed together."
00:26:04.080,00:26:07.590,皇上近日公主都有吃马蹄羹,00:26:06.340,00:26:09.740,"Your Majesty, the princess has been consuming
water chestnut porridge all these days."
00:26:08.040,00:26:11.390,想来问题就出在这里了,00:26:09.880,00:26:13.420,This might be the cause of the problem.
00:26:12.840,00:26:14.710,御膳房是怎么做的事,,,
00:26:15.000,00:26:16.230,连这个也会弄错,00:26:14.520,00:26:18.180,How could the Imperial Kitchen fail to distinguish them!
00:26:16.760,00:26:19.590,御膳房精于此道决计不会弄错,00:26:18.880,00:26:22.900,"It can't be the Imperial Kitchen.
They are experts in food."
00:26:21.240,00:26:25.630,想必是有人故意为之,00:26:23.340,00:26:25.560,I suppose ...
00:26:29.080,00:26:30.430,好阴毒的手段,00:26:25.960,00:26:28.940,there was someone behind this.
00:26:31.040,00:26:34.150,是要置朕的女儿于死地吗,00:26:31.060,00:26:36.440,"What a vicious trick!
How dare they attempt to kill my daughter?"
00:26:36.800,00:26:39.670,皇上求上天垂怜温宜,00:26:36.680,00:26:38.280,Huh?
00:26:40.280,00:26:43.670,臣妾身为其母愿担受任何惩罚,00:26:38.940,00:26:41.820,"Your Majesty, I pray that Heaven will have mercy on Wenyi."
00:26:43.960,00:26:44.870,快起来快起来,00:26:41.980,00:26:45.600,"As her mother, I will shoulder any punishment."
00:26:45.800,00:26:47.470,你求上天又有何用,00:26:45.820,00:26:47.400,Stand up quickly.
00:26:48.920,00:26:50.310,定是有人捣鬼,00:26:47.400,00:26:49.960,"Aiya, what's the use of praying to Heaven?"
00:26:50.640,00:26:52.150,存心与你母女过不去,00:26:50.760,00:26:55.640,This must be an intentional act to afflict you and your daughter.
00:26:55.000,00:26:57.110,还请皇上垂怜曹贵人母女,,,
00:26:57.480,00:26:58.390,彻查此事,,,
00:26:59.240,00:27:00.550,也好肃清宫闱,00:26:56.500,00:27:03.120,"I beg of Your Majesty to pity Lady Cao and Wenyi, and
thoroughly investigate to restore discipline in the palace."
00:27:01.560,00:27:03.670,确保再无此种龌龊之事发生,,,
00:27:04.840,00:27:06.870,那就查查吧,00:27:03.600,00:27:06.140,We must prevent the occurrence of such a heinous crime.
00:27:08.040,00:27:09.270,去让御膳房总管,00:27:06.380,00:27:09.040,"If so, let's start the investigation."
00:27:09.560,00:27:11.990,把近来碰过木薯粉的人一并带来,00:27:09.320,00:27:13.920,"Tell the chief of the Imperial Kitchen to bring all
who have recently touched the cassava starch."
00:27:12.640,00:27:14.790,再查哪些宫苑有谁领过的,,,
00:27:16.040,00:27:17.230,一个都不许放过,00:27:14.060,00:27:17.540,And list the palaces that have requested for it.
00:27:22.600,00:27:23.870,娘娘喝药,00:27:17.920,00:27:20.980,Not a single one to be missed.
,,,00:27:24.400,00:27:28.000,"Your Highness, here's the medicine for today."
00:27:35.160,00:27:37.910,今日拿药怎么拿了这么久,,,
00:27:38.400,00:27:39.990,奴婢听见太医说,00:27:36.540,00:27:40.460,Why did it take so long to pick it up today?
00:27:40.240,00:27:41.510,温宜公主一直吐奶,,,
00:27:42.080,00:27:43.950,所以就多问了几句,00:27:40.460,00:27:44.000,"I heard the doctors saying that
Princess Wenyi had been vomiting."
00:27:44.600,00:27:45.670,你觉得蹊跷,00:27:44.000,00:27:46.380,So I inquired for more information.
00:27:47.080,00:27:48.110,奴婢不知道,00:27:46.380,00:27:48.440,Do you think it's odd?
00:27:51.880,00:27:53.670,我今儿想出去走走,00:27:48.500,00:27:51.560,I can’t say for certain.
00:27:54.160,00:27:55.470,顺便看看公主,,,
00:27:56.800,00:27:59.550,娘娘避世多年何苦要出去呢,00:27:53.420,00:27:58.500,"(sigh) I'd like to go for a walk today.
I will drop by to see the princess."
00:28:00.640,00:28:01.430,避世,00:27:58.700,00:28:02.300,"Your Highness has been secluding yourself from them
all these years. Why would you trouble to get involved?"
00:28:02.920,00:28:07.710,只可惜树欲静而风不止,00:28:02.620,00:28:04.900,Secluding myself?
,,,00:28:04.900,00:28:11.200,"""The gusts of wind never spare a tree in seclusion."""
00:28:09.800,00:28:11.310,奴才查过档了,,,
00:28:11.880,00:28:13.190,只有莞贵人宫里,00:28:11.780,00:28:14.020,I have checked the registry.
00:28:13.440,00:28:16.150,曾让人在四日前来领过木薯粉,00:28:14.020,00:28:18.280,"Only a servant of Lady Sourire picked up
some cassava starch four days ago."
00:28:16.360,00:28:18.110,说是要做珍珠丸子,,,
00:28:18.400,00:28:19.830,此外再无他人,00:28:18.280,00:28:20.200,It was for making tapioca pearls according to the records.
00:28:29.400,00:28:31.910,四日前臣妾因想吃马蹄糕,00:28:20.360,00:28:23.000,No other palace has requested for cassava starch.
00:28:32.240,00:28:33.190,就让浣碧去取,,,
00:28:33.960,00:28:36.670,她回来时的确带了些木薯粉,00:28:31.520,00:28:35.740,"Four days ago, I asked Jade to order
water chestnut cakes from the Imperial Kitchen."
00:28:36.960,00:28:38.390,要为臣妾制珍珠丸子,00:28:35.740,00:28:41.000,"She did pick up some cassava starch
to make desserts for me."
00:28:39.200,00:28:43.590,那么敢问莞贵人木薯粉还在吗,00:28:41.380,00:28:46.600,"Lady Sourire, may I ask if you still have the cassava starch?"
00:28:44.880,00:28:46.150,想必还没有用完,,,
00:28:48.520,00:28:51.150,就只有莞贵人宫里的人去领过,00:28:46.800,00:28:49.380,I suppose we didn't use all of it.
00:28:51.440,00:28:52.270,再无旁人吗,,,
00:28:52.520,00:28:53.230,是,00:28:50.640,00:28:54.200,Did no one else request for it other than Lady Sourire's servant?
00:28:54.280,00:28:56.470,这也不能证明就是莞贵人做的,00:28:54.200,00:28:55.260,"Yes, Your Majesty."
,,,00:28:55.260,00:29:00.000,That cannot prove Lady Sourire did it.
00:29:04.120,00:29:04.910,回皇上,,,
00:29:05.160,00:29:07.790,七夕夜宴莞贵人曾独自外出,00:29:05.700,00:29:10.120,"Your Majesty, I saw Lady Sourire
leaving the banquet on the night of Qixi."
00:29:08.160,00:29:10.150,奴婢见小主好像往华妃娘娘,,,
00:29:10.520,00:29:12.150,所在的清凉殿方向去了,00:29:10.120,00:29:15.060,She seemed to be walking towards Consort Fleur's Cooling Hall.
00:29:13.240,00:29:14.790,你是亲眼所见吗,,,
00:29:15.480,00:29:17.070,亲眼所见千真万确,00:29:15.060,00:29:17.440,Did you see it yourself?
00:29:17.600,00:29:18.750,奴婢也看见了,00:29:17.440,00:29:19.540,I saw it with my own eyes.
00:29:19.160,00:29:22.230,当时小主身边还跟着槿汐姑姑,00:29:19.600,00:29:21.140,"I saw it too, Your Majesty."
,,,00:29:21.140,00:29:25.200,And Lady Sourire was with Madam Jinxi.
00:29:27.760,00:29:28.830,当日家宴,,,
00:29:29.360,00:29:31.590,清凉殿中宫人大多随侍,,,
00:29:31.920,00:29:35.150,所余仆妇也都多在偷闲,00:29:29.740,00:29:33.900,Most of my servants went to the banquet with me that night.
00:29:36.280,00:29:38.270,极有可能被人趁机,00:29:33.920,00:29:38.220,The remaining maids were probably idle at the Cooling Hall.
00:29:38.560,00:29:40.110,在饮食里做了手脚,00:29:38.220,00:29:42.760,"Someone might have taken advantage of that
to tamper with Wenyi's food."
00:29:41.640,00:29:42.990,如此看来,,,
00:29:44.920,00:29:48.190,莞贵人你好狠心哪,00:29:43.320,00:29:45.860,It would seem that ...
00:29:49.920,00:29:51.430,姐姐或许言行失当,00:29:46.000,00:29:51.320,"Lady Sourire, how heartless you are!"
00:29:51.760,00:29:53.190,无意间得罪了莞贵人,,,
00:29:53.760,00:29:55.270,只上次勤政殿一事,00:29:51.860,00:29:55.940,"I might have inadvertently offended Lady Sourire
with improper words or behavior."
00:29:55.480,00:29:56.870,姐姐确实是无心的,00:29:55.940,00:29:57.720,In the Governance Hall the other day ...
00:29:57.560,00:29:59.070,并非有意要引起妹妹,,,
00:29:59.560,00:30:00.670,与皇上的误会,00:29:57.740,00:30:02.860,"It wasn't my intention to cause misunderstanding
between you and His Majesty."
00:30:01.400,00:30:03.830,莞贵人若是因此而怪罪了姐姐,,,
00:30:04.400,00:30:07.110,便只打我骂我就是了,00:30:03.000,00:30:09.380,"If you blame me for that, you can scold me or punish me!"
00:30:07.560,00:30:09.350,千万不要伤害我的温宜,,,
00:30:10.080,00:30:12.350,她还是一个襁褓婴儿,00:30:09.380,00:30:11.760,I beg of you not to harm Wenyi.
00:30:16.200,00:30:17.590,曹姐姐误会了,00:30:11.760,00:30:15.020,She's such a young child!
00:30:18.360,00:30:20.710,妹妹并未觉得姐姐有何处得罪,00:30:18.280,00:30:20.240,"It's not like that, Lady Cao."
00:30:21.640,00:30:22.990,勤政殿一事,00:30:20.240,00:30:23.340,I never thought you offended me in any way.
00:30:23.640,00:30:25.710,也不曾让我与皇上有所误会,00:30:23.340,00:30:27.720,"What you said at the Governance Hall ... did not cause
misunderstanding between me and His Majesty."
00:30:26.320,00:30:27.710,又何来记恨一说呢,,,
00:30:29.280,00:30:30.310,难道是姐姐认为,00:30:27.720,00:30:30.840,Why would you feel that I am holding a grudge?
00:30:30.720,00:30:32.670,自己做了什么对不住妹妹的事,,,
00:30:33.160,00:30:34.310,妹妹竟不觉得,00:30:30.840,00:30:36.880,Is there something wrong you did to me that I'm unaware of?
00:30:36.960,00:30:39.710,曹贵人事情还没有查清楚,,,
00:30:40.080,00:30:41.350,你就这样哭哭啼啼的,,,
00:30:41.800,00:30:42.710,成何体统,00:30:38.920,00:30:44.480,"Lady Cao, it is indecorous to jump to conclusions
before a thorough investigation."
00:30:43.080,00:30:43.830,是,,,
00:30:44.040,00:30:45.910,本宫看再清楚不过了,00:30:44.480,00:30:45.780,Yes.
00:30:46.440,00:30:47.630,皇后这么说,,,
00:30:48.000,00:30:50.990,恐怕有袒护莞贵人之嫌吧,00:30:45.780,00:30:52.680,"There's no need for further investigation.
Your Majesty is partial to Lady Sourire."
00:30:51.200,00:30:53.430,华妃你这样说话,,,
00:30:53.680,00:30:55.750,是跟本宫该有的礼制吗,00:30:52.880,00:30:58.460,"Consort Fleur, observe decorum when you speak to me."
00:30:56.680,00:30:58.510,臣妾并非有意冒犯,,,
00:30:59.160,00:31:01.230,只是怜惜公主所受之罪,00:30:58.760,00:31:01.320,I have no intention to offend Your Majesty.
00:31:02.440,00:31:03.830,为曹贵人不平,00:31:01.400,00:31:06.780,"I'm simply indignant at Wenyi's suffering
on behalf of Lady Cao."
00:31:05.440,00:31:07.150,还请皇上做主,00:31:07.280,00:31:09.360,I plead with Your Majesty to make a fair judgement.
00:31:07.840,00:31:12.070,就算是心疼温宜也要尊重皇后,00:31:09.360,00:31:14.300,"You must show due respect to the empress
despite how you feel."
00:31:12.560,00:31:15.030,毕竟她才是后宫之主嘛,00:31:14.480,00:31:19.000,She is the head of the harem after all.
00:31:18.880,00:31:22.230,莞贵人你要说什么尽管说,00:31:20.820,00:31:24.000,"Lady Sourire, say what you have to say."
00:31:26.360,00:31:28.190,臣妾的确没有做过这样的事,,,
00:31:28.880,00:31:30.150,也不会去做这样的事,,,
00:31:30.920,00:31:33.150,那一晚你是去过清凉殿吗,00:31:28.400,00:31:32.580,I did not and will never do such a thing.
00:31:35.200,00:31:36.910,臣妾的确经过清凉殿,00:31:32.820,00:31:35.980,Did you go to the Cooling Hall that night?
00:31:37.680,00:31:38.790,但并未进去,00:31:37.240,00:31:41.760,I did walk past it but I didn't enter.
00:31:40.920,00:31:43.670,当时槿汐也在可以为臣妾作证,00:31:42.800,00:31:45.840,"Jinxi was with me that night.
She could testify for me."
00:31:44.200,00:31:47.910,槿汐是你的侍婢 证词可否有用,00:31:46.180,00:31:50.580,"Jinxi is your maid.
How can we trust her testimony?"
00:31:49.200,00:31:50.710,宫中除了御膳房,,,
00:31:51.000,00:31:52.670,就只有你宫里有木薯粉,00:31:50.900,00:31:54.940,"Except your palace and the Imperial Kitchen,
no one else has cassava starch."
00:31:53.640,00:31:55.910,况且有宫女目睹你,,,
00:31:56.280,00:31:57.790,前往清凉殿方向,00:31:55.340,00:31:59.580,"And some maids witnessed that
you were heading to the Cooling Hall."
00:31:58.320,00:32:00.310,你去之后公主便发作,,,
00:32:00.800,00:32:03.550,恐怕不是巧合二字,00:32:00.040,00:32:02.560,The princess started vomiting after you passed by.
00:32:03.920,00:32:05.230,可以搪塞得过去的吧,00:32:02.560,00:32:07.860,"I'm afraid you can't get away
by saying it was just a coincidence."
00:32:06.360,00:32:08.030,虽然事事指向臣妾,,,
00:32:08.760,00:32:10.150,但臣妾的确没有做过,00:32:08.220,00:32:11.980,"Although everything points to me,
I did not do anything like this!"
00:32:11.280,00:32:12.710,请皇上皇后明鉴,,,
00:32:13.520,00:32:14.950,你既然说没有,00:32:13.220,00:32:15.120,Your Majesties will make a fair judgement.
00:32:15.800,00:32:18.070,那么当夜你离席之后,,,
00:32:19.240,00:32:20.830,可曾遇到过什么人,00:32:15.320,00:32:25.520,"If you say so, did you meet someone who can
testify for you after you left the banquet?"
00:32:21.280,00:32:23.750,能证明你没有进入清凉殿,,,
00:32:24.440,00:32:27.310,也就证明你与此事无干,00:32:26.320,00:32:30.380,That will disprove the allegation against you.
00:32:30.240,00:32:35.870,臣妾没有遇见什么人,00:32:31.900,00:32:37.560,I ... did not meet anyone.
00:32:37.240,00:32:38.990,但也不知道还有谁,,,
00:32:39.640,00:32:41.750,看见臣妾没有进入清凉殿,00:32:39.160,00:32:44.860,"I don't know if there's anyone who saw
that I didn't enter the Cooling Hall."
00:32:43.480,00:32:44.710,你再好好想想,,,
00:32:45.880,00:32:48.550,要是能想起来有什么人,00:32:45.400,00:32:47.460,Take your time to recall.
00:32:48.960,00:32:51.270,证明你没有进入清凉殿的,00:32:47.720,00:32:54.580,Tell me if you can remember someone you saw.
00:32:52.040,00:32:53.030,你就告诉朕,,,
00:32:56.200,00:33:01.950,如此朕就只好让你禁足再做打算,00:32:57.400,00:33:03.800,"If so, I will have to confine you temporarily for further investigation."
00:33:04.560,00:33:08.070,你要相信朕一定会查清此事,00:33:06.420,00:33:10.460,Believe me that I will find out who is behind this.
00:33:08.840,00:33:10.550,必不使一人含冤,,,
00:33:11.200,00:33:12.790,这是你同朕说的,00:33:10.660,00:33:15.000,"No innocent person will be unfairly penalized.
This is what you told me."
00:33:13.400,00:33:15.390,是臣妾相信,,,
00:33:16.080,00:33:18.190,如此就先委屈你了,00:33:15.340,00:33:17.340,"Yes, I believe in Your Majesty."
,,,00:33:18.020,00:33:21.500,You will have to restrict yourself for the time being.
00:33:28.440,00:33:29.150,皇上,,,
00:33:29.880,00:33:32.830,当夜莞贵人是各本宫在一起,00:33:30.000,00:33:35.740,"Your Majesty ... that night, Lady Sourire was with me."
00:33:44.000,00:33:49.310,臣妾给皇上请安给皇后请安,00:33:45.720,00:33:51.100,Peace to Your Majesties.
00:33:49.640,00:33:51.230,不是说过让你免礼的吗,,,
00:33:51.520,00:33:52.710,先坐下再说赐座,00:33:51.100,00:33:53.140,I have always told you not to bow.
00:33:53.000,00:33:54.070,谢皇上皇后,00:33:53.140,00:33:54.500,"- Sit down quickly.
- Autumn."
,,,00:33:54.560,00:33:57.320,I thank Your Majesties.
00:34:04.920,00:34:06.190,你这身子受不了暑热,,,
00:34:06.560,00:34:07.390,你怎么出来了,,,
00:34:07.640,00:34:10.390,听说公主不好想来看看,00:34:06.700,00:34:09.160,Why did you come out on such a hot day?
00:34:10.840,00:34:12.670,见堂中似有大事发生,00:34:09.500,00:34:12.500,"I heard that the princess is unwell,
so I came to see her."
00:34:13.800,00:34:15.190,一时不敢进来,00:34:12.840,00:34:18.320,"I was hesitating to enter because
something serious seemed to be going on."
00:34:19.240,00:34:21.310,还好啊 臣妾是来了,00:34:21.160,00:34:23.240,But I'm glad that I came.
00:34:22.080,00:34:25.870,不然恐怕这里就要唱窦娥冤了,00:34:23.420,00:34:27.940,"Otherwise, ""The Injustice to Dou E""
would be played in this hall."
00:34:27.960,00:34:32.070,端妃说当夜你跟莞贵人一起,00:34:30.060,00:34:33.960,You said that you were with Lady Sourire that night.
00:34:32.400,00:34:33.150,真的吗,,,
00:34:35.560,00:34:38.830,那日臣妾见莞贵人似有醉意,00:34:34.160,00:34:36.660,"-Is that true?
-Mm."
00:34:39.360,00:34:42.950,一时不放心便同吉祥一同去看顾,00:34:37.480,00:34:40.940,"That night, I noticed that Lady Sourire
seemed to be drunk."
00:34:43.880,00:34:47.670,然后啊一同去了臣妾的宫中,00:34:41.180,00:34:45.340,I was worried about her and went out with Auspice.
00:34:48.600,00:34:49.710,聊了许久,00:34:45.860,00:34:49.680,I brought her into my palace ...
00:34:50.520,00:34:51.270,吉祥,,,
00:34:51.720,00:34:52.470,是,00:34:50.480,00:34:52.660,and we talked for a long time.
00:34:55.400,00:34:57.590,当夜娘娘与莞贵人讲论佛经,00:34:52.740,00:34:55.240,"-Auspice.
-Yes."
00:34:57.880,00:34:58.750,很是投契,00:34:56.820,00:35:00.500,"That night, Her Highness and Lady Sourire had a
congenial conversation about the Buddhist sutras."
00:34:59.040,00:35:00.790,后来莞贵人说时辰不早了,,,
00:35:01.120,00:35:02.190,才匆匆回去,00:35:00.880,00:35:04.480,Lady Sourire said that it was getting late and hurried back.
00:35:03.840,00:35:04.950,这样说来,,,
00:35:05.240,00:35:06.310,温宜公主的事,,,
00:35:06.600,00:35:08.350,就与莞贵人没关系了,00:35:04.640,00:35:10.000,"Oh? In that case, Lady Sourire
has nothing to do with the incident."
00:35:10.040,00:35:12.950,端妃真如及时雨一般哪,00:35:10.920,00:35:15.380,Isn't Consort Honnête like a timely rain?
00:35:13.560,00:35:16.430,端妃向来在宫中养病足不出户,,,
00:35:17.440,00:35:20.390,怎么那晚却不顾太医叮嘱,00:35:15.560,00:35:19.080,Consort Honnête would never go out during recuperation.
00:35:20.720,00:35:21.990,漏夜出门了呢,00:35:19.440,00:35:25.380,Why did you disobey the doctors' instruction that night?
00:35:23.680,00:35:26.390,久病之人的确不宜出门,,,
00:35:27.480,00:35:28.950,那日宫中家宴,00:35:25.620,00:35:29.080,I shouldn't have gone out given my persistent health condition.
00:35:29.600,00:35:32.550,臣妾呀听到了极好的丝竹之声,00:35:29.380,00:35:34.340,But I heard really beautiful music from the Qixi banquet.
00:35:32.840,00:35:35.390,一时神往便出门了,,,
00:35:36.240,00:35:39.870,不想与莞贵人如此有缘,00:35:34.700,00:35:38.180,I couldn't help going out following the music.
00:35:40.120,00:35:42.750,是嫔妾也有同感,00:35:38.200,00:35:42.060,It was such a delight to encounter Lady Sourire.
00:35:44.680,00:35:46.950,那莞贵人适才,00:35:42.260,00:35:44.680,"Yes, it was pleasure meeting Her Highness."
00:35:47.400,00:35:50.670,为什么不提及与端妃相遇之事呢,00:35:45.040,00:35:52.320,"Oh? Lady Sourire, why didn't you mention
anything about seeing Consort Honnête?"
00:35:58.440,00:35:59.830,臣妾本不该隐瞒,,,
00:36:00.560,00:36:02.070,当日端妃娘娘外出,00:36:00.040,00:36:02.500,I shouldn't have concealed anything from Your Majesties.
00:36:02.640,00:36:03.870,并不想让人知道,,,
00:36:04.240,00:36:05.830,以免令皇上皇后担忧,00:36:02.500,00:36:06.000,"Her Highness did not wish anyone else
to know about her egress that night"
00:36:06.680,00:36:09.030,所以当日娘娘与臣妾相约,00:36:06.000,00:36:08.320,in case it worries Your Majesties.
00:36:09.520,00:36:11.110,此事不让旁人知晓,00:36:08.640,00:36:13.700,So I agreed Her Highness that I would not tell anyone.
00:36:11.840,00:36:14.270,谁知会牵扯进公主一事,,,
00:36:14.920,00:36:18.910,臣妾心想皇上圣明皇后端慧,00:36:13.700,00:36:16.900,I never expected this to involve me with the princess.
00:36:19.240,00:36:20.750,必定还臣妾以清白,00:36:17.000,00:36:23.000,"I believe that I will be vindicated
by Your Majesties' wise judgement."
00:36:21.760,00:36:23.750,且不想失信于端妃娘娘,,,
00:36:24.480,00:36:25.950,所以三缄其口,00:36:23.000,00:36:28.380,And I kept quiet to honor my agreement with Her Highness.
00:36:26.960,00:36:30.110,怎么华妃你不信吗,,,
00:36:30.760,00:36:32.190,并非本宫多疑,00:36:28.780,00:36:32.480,"Why? You don't believe her, Consort Fleur?"
00:36:32.880,00:36:34.430,只是本宫觉得,00:36:32.480,00:36:34.660,I'm not a suspicious person.
00:36:34.920,00:36:37.910,端妃似乎很袒护莞贵人,00:36:34.660,00:36:40.500,I feel that you are covering up for her.
00:36:40.280,00:36:43.510,本宫与莞贵人只有两面之缘,00:36:42.300,00:36:46.380,I have only seen Lady Sourire twice.
00:36:44.480,00:36:47.670,初次相见也是在温宜周岁的礼上,00:36:46.380,00:36:50.380,The first time was on Wenyi's first birthday.
00:36:50.400,00:36:53.910,本宫病躯本不宜多事,00:36:52.420,00:36:57.020,I should stay out of trouble when I'm unwell.
00:36:55.440,00:36:57.030,何故要做谎言,,,
00:36:57.320,00:36:59.270,袒护一位不熟悉的贵人,00:36:57.260,00:37:02.060,Why would I tell lies to shield an unacquainted Nobel Lady?
00:37:09.480,00:37:10.190,起来,00:37:10.680,00:37:12.300,Rise.
00:37:14.520,00:37:15.390,先坐吧,,,
00:37:15.640,00:37:17.430,等一下让太医好好瞧瞧,,,
00:37:18.280,00:37:19.590,夏天衣服单薄,00:37:16.440,00:37:19.920,"Have a seat.
I'll call for the doctors to look after you."
00:37:20.000,00:37:21.470,别跪出什么毛病来,00:37:19.920,00:37:24.020,"I hope you didn't hurt your knees
wearing a thin summer dress."
00:37:22.320,00:37:24.910,莞贵人很守承诺,00:37:24.300,00:37:28.780,Lady Sourire is a woman of her word.
00:37:33.800,00:37:36.830,华妃不信本宫的话也是有理,,,
00:37:38.080,00:37:39.630,臣妾刚才在堂外,00:37:35.820,00:37:39.640,It's reasonable that Consort Fleur has doubts.
00:37:39.920,00:37:41.830,似乎听见有宫女说,,,
00:37:42.200,00:37:43.670,当夜看见莞贵人,,,
00:37:43.960,00:37:45.470,前往清凉殿的方向,00:37:40.120,00:37:47.700,"I seem to have heard the maids saying that they saw
Lady Sourire walking towards the Cooling Hall."
00:37:46.320,00:37:48.550,不如在这儿澄清一下比较好,,,
00:37:49.520,00:37:52.630,免得日后为此事再起纠葛,00:37:47.960,00:37:51.200,We had better ask them to clarify
00:37:55.040,00:37:56.270,你们再说一次,00:37:51.200,00:37:55.280,so that the misunderstanding will be resolved.
00:37:57.080,00:37:59.030,都是亲眼看着莞贵人,,,
00:37:59.320,00:38:00.630,进去清凉殿的吗,00:37:57.020,00:38:02.860,"Tell us once again, did you see
Lady Sourire enter the Cooling Hall?"
00:38:01.120,00:38:02.750,奴婢是见莞贵人,,,
00:38:03.080,00:38:04.350,往清凉殿方向去了,,,
00:38:04.800,00:38:07.830,至于有无进去似乎,00:38:03.100,00:38:06.620,"Your Majesty, I did see Lady Sourie
walking towards the Cooling Hall."
00:38:08.120,00:38:10.790,什么似乎 简直就是莫须有,00:38:06.620,00:38:09.560,As for whether she entered it ... It seems that ...
00:38:11.880,00:38:12.510,你呢,00:38:09.560,00:38:13.180,It seems what? This is an unfounded allegation!
00:38:12.720,00:38:13.470,奴婢,,,
00:38:13.680,00:38:16.350,奴婢只是见莞贵人带着槿汐姑姑,00:38:13.280,00:38:14.900,What about you?
00:38:18.560,00:38:20.030,皇上你看呢,00:38:15.000,00:38:19.020,Your Majesty .. I only saw Lady Sourire was with Madam Jinxi.
00:38:20.280,00:38:20.990,你看着办,00:38:19.760,00:38:22.240,(sigh) What does Your Majesty think?
00:38:21.720,00:38:22.510,只一条,00:38:22.240,00:38:23.680,It's up to you!
00:38:22.760,00:38:25.150,不许纵容了这种捕风捉影的恶习,00:38:23.680,00:38:27.500,"Only, show no tolerance when anyone
""chases the wind to catch the shadow""."
00:38:25.880,00:38:26.630,是,00:38:27.600,00:38:29.300,Yes.
00:38:32.040,00:38:35.230,拉出去各自掌嘴八十以儆效尤,00:38:33.860,00:38:37.940,"As a warning to others, slap yourselves
eighty times in the yard."
00:38:38.360,00:38:39.910,莞贵人请留步,00:38:40.320,00:38:43.720,"Lady Sourire, may I take a moment of your time?"
00:38:59.360,00:39:02.910,莞贵人可否愿意陪本宫走走,00:39:01.240,00:39:05.380,"Lady Sourire, I wonder if you
would like a saunter in the garden."
00:39:06.800,00:39:08.110,嫔妾正有此意,,,
00:39:11.760,00:39:14.830,今日事多谢娘娘替嫔妾解围,00:39:08.820,00:39:11.840,"With great pleasure, Your Highness."
00:39:15.720,00:39:19.030,本宫帮你自有本宫的道理,00:39:13.560,00:39:17.400,I humbly thank Your Highness for helping me today.
,,,00:39:17.700,00:39:21.920,I have my reasons to help you.
00:39:23.480,00:39:25.230,娘娘信嫔妾是清白的,,,
00:39:26.520,00:39:27.470,那日啊,00:39:25.020,00:39:28.220,Why does Your Highness believe I'm innocent?
00:39:27.720,00:39:30.670,我见你带着侍婢从畅春园而来,00:39:28.300,00:39:32.820,"That night, I saw you walking from the
Garden of Vibrant Spring with your maid."
00:39:31.080,00:39:32.510,经过我宫门口,,,
00:39:33.080,00:39:35.990,细算时辰哪就知道不是你,00:39:33.060,00:39:38.480,"I knew you did not do it, based on the timing."
00:39:36.920,00:39:39.390,那日匆忙却未瞧见娘娘,,,
00:39:39.880,00:39:40.910,望娘娘恕罪,00:39:38.800,00:39:43.340,"I was careless to not notice Your Highness.
I hope Your Highness will pardon me."
00:39:43.160,00:39:44.510,这些都是小事,,,
00:39:45.400,00:39:47.150,温宜公主很可爱,00:39:44.820,00:39:47.280,Don't mention it.
00:39:47.560,00:39:50.990,只是她这么小就饱受折磨,00:39:47.280,00:39:53.700,"Princess Wenyi is adorable, but she has to
suffer so much at such a young age."
00:39:52.240,00:39:53.670,公主虽然体弱,,,
00:39:54.120,00:39:57.310,但也是金枝玉叶自有神佛护佑,00:39:54.200,00:40:00.320,"Although the princess is fragile, she is blessed
by the Buddha as a distinguished imperial child."
00:40:01.040,00:40:03.070,曹贵人的这个孩子呀,,,
00:40:03.600,00:40:05.350,本来是生不下来的,00:40:01.780,00:40:07.900,(sigh) Lady Cao was barely able to give birth to Wenyi.
00:40:06.040,00:40:07.590,她怀得不是时候,,,
00:40:08.040,00:40:11.630,生产的时候又是难产胎位不正,00:40:07.900,00:40:14.700,"She was pregnant at a bad time and experienced
difficult labor due to abnormal fetal position."
00:40:12.800,00:40:14.750,险些搭上了一条命,,,
00:40:15.960,00:40:19.830,可是皇上对这个孩子非常州地怜爱,00:40:14.700,00:40:17.780,She narrowly escaped death.
00:40:20.840,00:40:24.310,这宫里头的孩子呀 看似尊贵,00:40:18.000,00:40:22.540,But His Majesty adores Wenyi very much.
00:40:25.160,00:40:26.590,三灾八难的,00:40:22.540,00:40:27.000,"Although they are distinguished as imperial descendants,"
00:40:27.720,00:40:29.870,比外头的孩子多多了,00:40:27.000,00:40:32.760,they are severely afflicted compared to children outside the palace.
00:40:34.080,00:40:36.590,此事针对你莞贵人而来,,,
00:40:37.160,00:40:39.550,莞贵人要善自保重啊,00:40:33.200,00:40:42.140,"(huff) Lady Sourire, this was targeted at you.
You must be more careful in the future."
00:40:40.520,00:40:42.750,本宫今日可以护你一次,,,
00:40:43.320,00:40:45.350,却不能事事如此啊,00:40:42.500,00:40:48.260,"I was able to help you this one time,
but I can't protect you every time."
00:40:47.120,00:40:48.710,谢娘娘费心周全,,,
00:40:49.520,00:40:53.470,嫔妾有空自当过来看望娘娘,00:40:48.800,00:40:55.740,"I thank Your Highness for your caring advice.
I will find a chance to visit Your Highness."
00:40:53.880,00:40:54.830,不必了,,,
00:40:59.920,00:41:02.790,病中残躯不便见人,00:40:55.820,00:40:58.120,Don't worry.
00:41:04.160,00:41:08.750,何况何况本宫与莞贵人不见面,00:41:01.180,00:41:05.900,It's inconvenient for me to greet you with my debilitated body.
00:41:09.360,00:41:10.870,才多有裨益呀,00:41:06.340,00:41:13.320,"Besides, it is beneficial for us to avoid seeing each other."
00:41:12.040,00:41:12.710,是,,,
00:41:16.400,00:41:17.430,回禀莞贵人,00:41:13.880,00:41:15.620,Yes.
00:41:17.680,00:41:20.190,娘娘身子弱该早些回去歇息了,00:41:18.120,00:41:22.420,"Lady Sourire, Her Highness has to go now to have some rest."
00:41:20.480,00:41:22.430,那嫔妾就不打扰了,00:41:22.420,00:41:25.780,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:41:36.560,00:41:37.430,娘娘,,,
00:41:40.640,00:41:42.390,这件事该如何料理才好,00:41:38.140,00:41:40.380,Your Highness.
00:41:42.960,00:41:45.670,是嫔妾已经想过了,00:41:42.540,00:41:45.240,What should we do about this?
00:41:46.000,00:41:47.830,不如找个人顶出去便罢,,,
00:41:48.280,00:41:49.230,一了百了,00:41:45.500,00:41:52.100,"Your Highness, I have thought about it.
We will send a scapegoat to put an end to it."
00:41:50.400,00:41:51.750,这样做能担保无事吗,,,
00:41:52.320,00:41:53.270,嫔妾敢担保,00:41:52.100,00:41:54.120,Can we assure that everything will be fine?
00:41:55.320,00:41:58.750,那便好只要不牵出本宫就是,00:41:54.120,00:41:56.340,"Yes, I can assure Your Highness."
00:42:01.280,00:42:02.830,日哭夜哭烦死了,00:41:57.160,00:42:02.520,"Very well then, as long as I'm not involved."
00:42:03.280,00:42:04.150,你抱出去哄吧,,,
00:42:05.440,00:42:06.190,是,00:42:02.940,00:42:06.880,"She cries all day and all night!
Take her away to pacify her."
00:42:07.320,00:42:08.470,一会儿再抱回来,00:42:07.100,00:42:08.900,Yes!
00:42:10.880,00:42:11.990,臣妾明白,00:42:09.000,00:42:12.080,Bring her back later.
,,,00:42:12.580,00:42:15.120,"Yes, Your Highness."
