00:02:23.810,00:02:26.260,你们看看年羹尧的这本折子,00:02:24.680,00:02:27.500,"All of you, take a look at Nian Gengyao's memorandum."
00:02:43.370,00:02:44.450,年羹尧请皇上,,,
00:02:44.620,00:02:46.950,顾念与允禩允禟兄弟之情,00:02:44.200,00:02:48.560,Niang Gengyao hopes the brotherhood between Your Majesty and Yunsi and Yuntang will be considered.
00:02:48.160,00:02:49.990,表面的意思不算意思,00:02:48.980,00:02:51.120,That's just the meaning on the surface.
00:02:51.920,00:02:54.410,你们得读出年羹尧的心思来,00:02:52.900,00:02:55.700,"You need to understand what
Nian Gengyao wants beneath it."
00:02:56.000,00:02:58.590,这厮是在试探朕,00:02:56.740,00:02:59.620,This man is trying to determine my position.
00:02:59.220,00:03:01.170,年羹尧借请皇上,,,
00:03:01.430,00:03:03.510,顾惜兄弟之情为由,00:03:00.100,00:03:04.300,"In asking Your Majesty to take brotherhood into consideration,"
00:03:04.300,00:03:08.010,实则是在为他自己求情留下后路,00:03:05.140,00:03:09.520,"Nian Gengyao is actually using this to
excuse himself from Your Majesty's punishment."
00:03:09.390,00:03:10.550,他倒聪明得很,00:03:10.260,00:03:11.980,"He's clever, that's for sure."
00:03:12.690,00:03:15.810,如果朕连允禩 允禟,,,
00:03:16.070,00:03:18.730,结党谋逆的事都可原谅,00:03:13.460,00:03:19.720,"If I can pardon the crimes of treason
committed by Yunsi and Yuntang,"
00:03:19.650,00:03:21.640,那么他年羹尧如何妄为,,,
00:03:22.490,00:03:23.520,也都能原谅了,00:03:20.540,00:03:24.800,"that means I can pardon him as well
whatever crimes he commits."
00:03:24.320,00:03:25.310,年羹尧的话,,,
00:03:25.530,00:03:27.450,与那日隆科多大人所言,00:03:25.280,00:03:29.900,"General Longkodo said something similar to
Nian Gengyao's memorandum the other day."
00:03:27.830,00:03:28.780,如出一辙,,,
00:03:29.580,00:03:32.870,年羹尧和隆科多,00:03:30.420,00:03:33.840,Nian Gengyao and Longkodo
00:03:33.750,00:03:36.120,都是朕的脓股之臣,00:03:34.640,00:03:37.380,have been like my arms and shoulders.
00:03:37.750,00:03:41.250,连他们都被允禩愚弄,00:03:38.560,00:03:42.320,"Even they were fooled by Yunsi,"
00:03:42.590,00:03:46.680,以为朕过于苛刻 为允禩抱屈,00:03:43.420,00:03:47.680,and think I've been too harsh on him.
00:03:48.270,00:03:50.470,想来真叫朕寒心不已,00:03:49.200,00:03:51.820,It's a disappointing realization.
00:03:51.140,00:03:53.480,允禩 允禟未曾削爵之时,,,
00:03:53.810,00:03:55.430,与敦亲王最亲密,00:03:52.280,00:03:56.520,"Yunsi and Yuntang were quite close to State Prince Dun
before being deprived of their noble titles."
00:03:55.900,00:03:57.230,所以朝中敦亲王,,,
00:03:57.570,00:04:00.650,对皇上惩治允禩允禟最为喊怨,00:03:56.760,00:03:59.700,"That's why State Prince Dun expressed
the most resentment against"
,,,00:03:59.700,00:04:01.860,Your Majesty's punishments on Yunsi and Yuntang.
00:04:00.940,00:04:03.560,如今年羹尧也有这糊涂心思,00:04:01.860,00:04:04.600,Now Nian Gengyao foolishly has the same thoughts.
00:04:04.110,00:04:05.350,他又手握兵权,00:04:05.040,00:04:06.760,"And with military power in his hands,"
00:04:05.990,00:04:08.650,臣恐怕他要是被敦亲王所利用,00:04:06.920,00:04:09.700,"I'm afraid if he is taken advantage of by State Prince Dun,"
00:04:09.370,00:04:11.280,岂非是大祸患,00:04:10.180,00:04:12.200,it will be disastrous.
00:04:11.710,00:04:13.820,你说的恐怕早就是事实了,00:04:12.620,00:04:15.100,What you have said is probably already true.
00:04:15.380,00:04:17.580,年羹尧与敦亲王勾结,,,
00:04:18.340,00:04:19.950,已非一日两日,00:04:16.320,00:04:21.060,Nian Gengyao and State Prince Dun began colluding more than just a short time ago.
00:04:20.880,00:04:22.090,你们都以为年羹尧,,,
00:04:22.340,00:04:24.250,只不过是贪财冷酷,00:04:21.880,00:04:25.760,"All of you thought that Nian Gengyao
was only avaricious and cruel."
00:04:26.090,00:04:29.840,其实他与谋逆之人有何分别,00:04:27.020,00:04:30.600,But he is no different from those who are rebellious.
00:04:30.680,00:04:31.420,臣以为,,,
00:04:31.810,00:04:34.170,必先断了他俩人的朕系才好,00:04:31.560,00:04:35.260,"Your Majesty, we must first put an end to their relationship."
00:04:35.100,00:04:40.640,要除年羹尧 先得除敦亲王,00:04:36.140,00:04:37.860,"To get rid of Nian Gengyao,"
,,,00:04:39.740,00:04:41.860,State Prince Dun must be eliminated first.
00:04:42.650,00:04:43.890,这些日子以来,00:04:43.620,00:04:44.940,"Lately,"
00:04:44.780,00:04:48.440,后宫里是争风吃醋 风波不断,00:04:45.740,00:04:49.560,"the harem has been in turmoil, plagued by jealousy."
00:04:49.700,00:04:51.940,朕先料理了后宫,00:04:50.760,00:04:53.520,First I'll take care of affairs in the harem
00:04:52.750,00:04:55.610,再腾出手来管前朝的事,00:04:53.620,00:04:56.880,and address the state affairs afterwards.
00:04:56.920,00:04:59.880,甄兄 今儿个皇上的话,00:04:58.020,00:05:01.600,"Mr. Zhen, what His Majesty said today seems a bit odd."
00:05:00.130,00:05:02.240,有点不大对味儿啊 请教一二,,,
00:05:02.420,00:05:04.380,别别别 鄂敏大人言重了,00:05:01.600,00:05:03.300,I hope you can enlighten me.
00:05:04.630,00:05:05.420,有话直说,00:05:03.440,00:05:06.460,"You flatter me, Mr. Gūwalgiya.
 Let's get to the point."
00:05:06.640,00:05:08.670,我到皇上的上书房来面圣,,,
00:05:08.970,00:05:09.680,只来过两次,00:05:07.460,00:05:10.800,I've only been summoned to His Majesty's study twice.
00:05:09.970,00:05:11.460,所以不大明白皇上的圣意,,,
00:05:11.810,00:05:13.840,莞嫔娘娘是皇上最宠爱的,00:05:10.820,00:05:12.780,So I'm not sure what His Majesty's intentions are.
00:05:14.390,00:05:15.930,想必有些话会告诉大人,00:05:12.780,00:05:15.140,Concubine Sourire is in high favor with His Maesty.
00:05:16.140,00:05:16.880,皇上他,00:05:15.260,00:05:17.340,Her Highness must have informed you of some details.
00:05:18.100,00:05:18.720,您说,00:05:17.340,00:05:18.320,His Majesty...
00:05:19.980,00:05:20.970,今儿个皇上,00:05:18.760,00:05:20.080,"Oh, go ahead."
00:05:21.650,00:05:24.860,把年羹尧和隆科多相提并论,00:05:20.960,00:05:25.800,"Today, His Majesty spoke of Nian Gengyao
and Longkodo in the same manner."
00:05:25.200,00:05:28.150,莫非皇上想除掉的不止年羹尧,00:05:25.880,00:05:29.160,"Could His Majesty want to get rid of
more than just Nian Gengyao?"
00:05:29.070,00:05:30.910,皇上圣意深远,00:05:30.020,00:05:31.860,His Majesty has a profound perspective.
00:05:31.240,00:05:32.950,这不是你我所能揣测的,00:05:31.960,00:05:34.280,It is not something we can speculate on.
00:05:34.500,00:05:37.200,能够长长久久跟随皇上的人,00:05:35.400,00:05:38.460,"For those who devote their service to His Majesty,"
00:05:38.080,00:05:39.410,那自然皇上什么都能,,,
00:05:39.790,00:05:40.910,给他指点明白了,00:05:38.820,00:05:41.960,they will surely be well advised by His Majesty.
00:05:41.590,00:05:43.920,还有一事 我知道皇上,00:05:42.300,00:05:43.960,There's one more thing.
00:05:44.210,00:05:45.670,不是沉溺于后宫之人,00:05:44.140,00:05:46.760,His Majesty is not someone who indulges in the harem.
00:05:46.050,00:05:49.040,可今儿个他说先平和后宫之事,00:05:46.840,00:05:51.340,"But His Majesty said he'll deal with
the harem before the state affairs."
00:05:49.300,00:05:50.260,然后再管前朝,,,
00:05:51.720,00:05:52.550,这个,00:05:52.380,00:05:53.660,That is ...
00:05:54.890,00:05:58.010,大概是后宫新添了位答应,00:05:55.540,00:05:59.080,It's probably because of the new Companion.
00:05:58.600,00:06:00.890,为了平衡各宫的醋意,00:05:59.460,00:06:02.020,"In order to soothe the jealousy in the harem,"
00:06:01.440,00:06:03.150,皇上也得花点心思吧,00:06:02.440,00:06:04.700,His Majesty will have to put in some thought.
00:06:10.660,00:06:12.190,今日宫中姐妹尽在,00:06:11.620,00:06:13.440,Everyone is here tonight.
00:06:12.580,00:06:14.570,臣妾敬皇上皇后一杯,00:06:13.580,00:06:15.880,This is to Your Majesties.
00:06:15.160,00:06:18.820,愿皇上皇后圣体安康 福泽万年,00:06:16.020,00:06:19.960,Wishing Your Majesties good health and long-lasting fortune.
00:06:38.310,00:06:40.930,皇上万福金安 酒烈伤身,00:06:39.200,00:06:40.640,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
,,,00:06:40.880,00:06:42.300,Alcohol can damage your health.
00:06:41.400,00:06:43.890,臣妾用心择了一盘好果子,00:06:42.380,00:06:45.120,I carefully chose these grapes.
00:06:44.320,00:06:45.650,请皇上品尝一下,00:06:45.260,00:06:47.060,"Please try some, Your Majesty"
00:07:01.920,00:07:02.830,尚可,00:07:02.940,00:07:04.300,They're pleasant.
00:07:06.250,00:07:08.460,颂芝妹妹是用心为皇上,,,
00:07:08.800,00:07:09.460,择的果子吗,00:07:07.240,00:07:10.500,"Song Zhi, are you sure you hand-picked
those grapes with care?"
00:07:10.220,00:07:11.750,皇上并没有赞不绝口,00:07:11.200,00:07:12.960,They weren't highly praised by His Majesty.
00:07:12.430,00:07:14.510,看来妹妹要好好体察,,,
00:07:14.800,00:07:16.040,皇上心意才是啊,00:07:13.400,00:07:17.260,"Perhaps you need to more carefully observe
His Majesty's preferences."
00:07:23.150,00:07:24.480,娘娘教训得是,00:07:24.120,00:07:25.840,I thank Your Highness for the advice.
00:07:25.110,00:07:27.350,嫔妾伺候皇上不过月余,00:07:26.040,00:07:28.340,I've only served His Majesty since last month
00:07:27.650,00:07:29.060,不是之处仍有许多,00:07:28.420,00:07:30.220,and still have much to learn.
00:07:29.440,00:07:30.520,但请娘娘教导,00:07:30.320,00:07:32.000,Your Highness's advice is always appreciated.
00:07:31.240,00:07:34.400,只是嫔妾虽不如娘娘善体上意,00:07:32.240,00:07:35.400,"But even though I'm not as observant as Your Highness,"
00:07:34.870,00:07:36.320,但是关于皇上的一切,,,
00:07:36.620,00:07:37.700,没有说不用心的,00:07:35.740,00:07:38.920,"I am still very attentive to everything
regarding His Majesty."
00:07:39.450,00:07:40.820,嫔妾日夜所想,,,
00:07:41.080,00:07:42.540,没有不是关于皇上的,00:07:40.040,00:07:43.500,"Day and night, my thoughts are all about His Majesty."
00:07:43.000,00:07:44.080,还请皇上明鉴,00:07:43.920,00:07:45.520,I hope Your Majesty understands.
00:07:45.130,00:07:48.740,朕知道 有朕在,00:07:46.120,00:07:47.500,I do.
00:07:49.550,00:07:50.910,不会有人敢这样说你,00:07:49.000,00:07:51.920,No one will dare speak of you like this in my presence.
00:07:55.680,00:07:58.220,皇上一向爱惜莞嫔妹妹,00:07:56.680,00:07:59.300,Your Majesty has always adored Concubine Sourire
00:07:58.850,00:08:00.260,难得为别人说话,00:07:59.800,00:08:01.840,and rarely speaks up for someone else.
00:08:00.980,00:08:04.760,可见皇上是真怜惜颂芝妹妹,00:08:02.040,00:08:05.920,Looks like Your Majesty is truly fond of Song Zhi.
00:08:06.110,00:08:07.600,颂芝妹妹说得极是,00:08:07.060,00:08:08.960,"What you said was correct, Song Zhi."
00:08:08.480,00:08:09.720,这皇上的心意,,,
00:08:10.360,00:08:12.570,谁不是一点一点揣摩出来的,00:08:09.240,00:08:13.740,"Didn't we all have to learn about
His Majesty's preferences bit by bit?"
00:08:13.740,00:08:15.070,难道全凭一腔子,,,
00:08:15.410,00:08:16.270,对皇上的热情吗,00:08:14.660,00:08:17.680,"You can't figure it out by just
having passion for His Majesty."
00:08:17.700,00:08:19.410,不过妹妹可要加把劲了,00:08:18.680,00:08:21.220,"However, it's already July, so"
00:08:20.500,00:08:21.950,如今已是七月,00:08:21.400,00:08:23.040,you need to put in more effort.
00:08:22.830,00:08:26.670,八月初圣驾回奎 中秋的时候,00:08:23.760,00:08:26.300,His Majesty returns to the Palace in early August.
,,,00:08:26.500,00:08:27.960,And on the Mid-Autumn Festival
00:08:26.920,00:08:29.330,就该是三年一度的秀女大选了,00:08:27.960,00:08:30.480,the triennial Concubine selection will be held.
00:08:30.170,00:08:31.630,到时候新人辈出,00:08:31.180,00:08:32.800,"Once the new concubines arrive in plenty,"
00:08:32.010,00:08:33.920,妹妹可就有的忙了,00:08:32.900,00:08:35.120,you'll have so much to worry about.
00:08:35.930,00:08:37.840,再忙也忙不过娘娘啊,00:08:37.020,00:08:39.260,I can't possibly be as concerned as Your Highness.
00:08:38.970,00:08:40.180,莞嫔娘娘年长,,,
00:08:40.430,00:08:41.760,又深得皇上喜爱,00:08:39.960,00:08:42.700,"Being older and in high favor of His Majesty,"
00:08:41.980,00:08:43.340,自然能游刃有余地,,,
00:08:43.690,00:08:44.930,教导那些姐妹们了,00:08:42.860,00:08:46.240,"Your Highness will certainly be capable of
skillfully disciplining the newcomers."
00:08:48.480,00:08:52.320,常听人说 辛勤之人不易老,00:08:49.220,00:08:53.440,"I have often heard that
""An industrious maid doesn't age."""
00:08:53.150,00:08:54.480,妹妹不仅辛勤,00:08:54.100,00:08:55.680,"You're not only hardworking,"
00:08:55.110,00:08:58.200,而且善于体察上意 左右逢源,00:08:56.140,00:08:59.020,but also good at speculating on your superiors.
00:08:58.780,00:09:01.150,所以才能得华妃娘娘如此欢心,,,
00:09:01.620,00:09:02.830,将你献于皇上,00:08:59.840,00:09:03.800,"It's no wonder Consort Fleur favored you so much
that she offered you to His Majesty."
00:09:03.410,00:09:05.950,这些都是本宫做不来的,00:09:04.340,00:09:07.140,I would never be able to provide such.
00:09:16.840,00:09:18.250,莞嫔放肆了,00:09:17.920,00:09:19.820,Concubine Sourire is being impertinent.
00:09:19.430,00:09:21.040,皇上要坐视不理吗,00:09:20.220,00:09:22.380,Is Your Majesty going to just sit and watch?
00:09:21.720,00:09:22.630,皇后怎么看,00:09:22.600,00:09:24.180,What is your thought on this?
00:09:23.930,00:09:26.420,女人多难免会有口舌之争,00:09:24.780,00:09:27.560,A war of words is inevitable with so many women.
00:09:27.020,00:09:29.810,今天高兴 喝多了两口酒,00:09:27.980,00:09:30.900,"Everyone is in a good mood today and
has had more wine than usual."
00:09:30.110,00:09:31.140,不是有心的,,,
00:09:31.690,00:09:32.770,等散席之后,00:09:30.920,00:09:32.500,They don't have any ill intentions.
00:09:33.070,00:09:34.850,本宫会跟她们好好地说,00:09:32.660,00:09:35.980,I will speak to them after the banquet.
00:09:37.360,00:09:39.980,皇后平日就是这样,,,
00:09:40.330,00:09:42.530,给朕治理后宫的吗,00:09:38.460,00:09:43.660,So this is how you have been managing the harem for me?
00:09:44.750,00:09:47.950,难怪这后宫之中,00:09:45.620,00:09:46.800,No wonder
00:09:48.210,00:09:50.920,平时总是风波不断,00:09:48.120,00:09:52.060,the harem is constantly in turmoil!
00:09:58.090,00:10:00.430,皇上息怒 都是臣妾不好,00:09:59.000,00:10:01.880,"May peace be restored in Your Majesty.
It is all my fault."
00:10:01.390,00:10:03.470,你可知道你的不是是在哪里,00:10:02.380,00:10:04.800,Do you know why you are at fault?
00:10:05.850,00:10:08.510,后宫里口角相争都不能平,00:10:06.740,00:10:09.660,"If you can't even quell a quarrel in the harem,"
00:10:10.230,00:10:11.940,岂非你这个皇后无能,00:10:11.120,00:10:13.580,what are you capable of as the Empress?
00:10:13.860,00:10:16.820,臣妾有罪 还请皇上息怒,00:10:14.900,00:10:18.320,"I recognize my offense.
May Your Majesty's anger be calmed."
00:10:18.530,00:10:19.320,莞嫔,,,
00:10:20.200,00:10:20.810,臣妾在,00:10:19.300,00:10:20.620,Concubine Sourire.
00:10:21.740,00:10:22.400,去吧,00:10:20.960,00:10:22.140,Your Majesty.
,,,00:10:22.760,00:10:24.040,"Leave, now."
00:10:24.870,00:10:25.530,皇上,00:10:25.860,00:10:27.100,Your Majesty.
00:10:30.790,00:10:32.120,皇上的意思是,00:10:31.540,00:10:33.260,What does Your Majesty mean?
00:10:32.500,00:10:33.960,皇上向来公正严明,00:10:33.380,00:10:35.180,His Majesty always makes just decisions
00:10:34.710,00:10:36.330,自然是不会偏私的,00:10:35.740,00:10:37.220,and would never be partial.
,,,00:10:37.760,00:10:39.020,Concubine Sourire
00:10:36.970,00:10:42.630,莞嫔御前失仪 出言无状,00:10:39.780,00:10:41.720,breached propriety before me
,,,00:10:42.240,00:10:44.160, and spoke indecorously.
00:10:44.430,00:10:48.390,明日送往蓬莱洲闭门思过,00:10:45.440,00:10:46.320,"Tomorrow,"
,,,00:10:46.920,00:10:49.400,"she will be sent to Penglai Island
for self-reflection."
00:10:49.230,00:10:51.090,非诏不得外出,00:10:50.100,00:10:52.660,Forbidden to leave without my edict.
00:10:55.480,00:10:58.900,皇上 蓬莱洲远在后湖之中,00:10:56.480,00:10:59.980,"Your Majesty, Penglai Island is
located in the middle of the back lake."
00:10:59.280,00:11:00.390,四处无路可通,,,
00:11:00.780,00:11:03.520,唯有小舟可至 偏远不说,00:11:00.080,00:11:02.940,It is only accessible by boat with no roads leading to it.
00:11:03.780,00:11:05.320,更是年久无人居住了,00:11:03.700,00:11:06.320,It is remote and has long been uninhabited.
00:11:05.700,00:11:07.530,还请皇上念在姐姐是初犯,,,
00:11:08.370,00:11:09.410,饶恕姐姐吧,00:11:06.620,00:11:10.440,"I hope Your Majesty will forgive Concubine Sourire
as this is only her first offense."
00:11:10.500,00:11:13.210,皇上 臣妾侍候皇上三年,00:11:11.440,00:11:14.200,I've served Your Majesty for three years.
00:11:13.540,00:11:16.030,虽有失礼之处 但请皇上念及,00:11:14.540,00:11:17.020,"Although I was discourteous,"
00:11:16.800,00:11:19.960,臣妾侍奉皇上向来谨慎妥帖,00:11:17.740,00:11:21.020,"I hope Your Majesty will take my
past service into consideration"
00:11:20.590,00:11:22.460,还请皇上饶恕臣妾这一回,00:11:21.480,00:11:23.340,and forgive me just this once.
00:11:22.760,00:11:23.800,臣妾再也不敢了,,,
00:11:24.050,00:11:25.340,方才对颂芝说话,00:11:23.580,00:11:24.980,I won't dare do it again.
00:11:25.720,00:11:27.340,不是还盛气凌人吗,00:11:25.020,00:11:28.380,You were speaking so arrogantly just now to Song Zhi.
00:11:28.640,00:11:31.470,当着朕的面就敢有嫉妒言行,00:11:29.520,00:11:32.640,"If you can express such jealousy in my presence,"
00:11:31.900,00:11:34.600,背后更不知如何刁钻,00:11:32.740,00:11:36.100,"then how much more maliciously
do you treat her behind my back?"
00:11:36.070,00:11:37.310,臣妾是无心的,00:11:36.980,00:11:38.320,I did not mean it.
00:11:37.530,00:11:41.360,朕这些日子宠爱颂芝,00:11:38.360,00:11:40.520,You've treated Song Zhi disdainfully
,,,00:11:41.100,00:11:42.320,just because
00:11:42.280,00:11:43.740,你就多番为难她,00:11:43.240,00:11:44.800,I have been fond of her recently.
00:11:44.870,00:11:50.450,更在背后出言轻狂 朕岂能容你,00:11:45.880,00:11:48.460,You also made many insolent remarks.
00:11:50.960,00:11:51.870,臣妾没有,00:11:50.060,00:11:51.840,How can I tolerate such behavior?
,,,00:11:51.980,00:11:53.180,I did not.
00:11:55.540,00:11:56.660,皇上知道的,00:11:56.420,00:11:57.840,"His Majesty has already announced his decree.
How dare you try to refute it."
00:11:57.750,00:11:59.590,臣妾一向心直口快,00:11:58.820,00:12:00.340,I have always been outspoken.
00:12:00.470,00:12:01.800,并非存心低毁,00:12:01.460,00:12:03.400,It was not my intention to slander her.
00:12:02.720,00:12:05.420,皇上 念在莞嫔是初犯,,,
00:12:05.930,00:12:07.290,还是从轻发落吧,00:12:03.600,00:12:08.600,"Your Majesty, please give Concubine Sourire a
lighter punishment as it's her first offense."
00:12:07.640,00:12:09.430,蓬莱洲太过偏远了,00:12:08.700,00:12:10.700,Penglai Island is far too remote.
00:12:10.520,00:12:13.300,皇上圣旨已下 你还敢反驳吗,00:12:11.540,00:12:14.960,"His Majesty has already announced his decree.
How dare you try to refute it?"
00:12:15.230,00:12:18.970,蓬莱洲宽敞 敬妃可愿相陪吗,00:12:16.020,00:12:17.960,Penglai Island is spacious.
,,,00:12:18.320,00:12:20.840,"Would you like to accompany her, Consort Estime?"
00:12:28.410,00:12:30.150,真是委屈了芝答应,00:12:29.160,00:12:31.700,Companion Zhi must be feeling aggrieved.
00:12:32.710,00:12:34.120,朕自会安慰她,00:12:33.740,00:12:35.460,I will comfort her.
00:12:35.540,00:12:36.160,苏培盛,,,
00:12:36.670,00:12:37.330,嗻,00:12:36.380,00:12:37.580,Su Peisheng
00:12:42.970,00:12:44.380,莞嫔娘娘请起来吧,00:12:37.700,00:12:38.580,Yes.
00:12:45.010,00:12:46.120,奴才会打点人,00:12:43.800,00:12:45.700,"Please rise, Your Highness."
00:12:46.340,00:12:48.130,送娘娘到蓬莱洲小住的,00:12:45.880,00:12:49.460,"I will arrange for Your Highness's
stay at Penglai Island."
00:12:56.900,00:12:58.230,莞嫔好走啊,00:12:57.680,00:12:59.720,"Take care, Concubine Sourire."
00:12:59.900,00:13:00.930,臣妾告退,00:13:00.640,00:13:02.460,I shall take my leave now.
00:13:02.320,00:13:03.100,嫔妾无能,00:13:03.280,00:13:04.460,"Though incompetent,"
00:13:03.360,00:13:05.650,会替莞嫔娘娘好好照顾皇上的,00:13:04.460,00:13:06.780,"I will take good care of His Majesty
in place of Your Highness."
00:13:06.240,00:13:07.270,娘娘走好啊,00:13:07.220,00:13:08.980,May Your Highness have a safe trip.
00:13:20.840,00:13:22.330,皇后娘娘万福金安,,,
00:13:22.550,00:13:23.250,起来,00:13:21.680,00:13:24.060,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Rise."
00:13:23.420,00:13:24.330,多谢皇后娘娘,00:13:24.140,00:13:25.660,I thank Your Majesty.
00:13:25.430,00:13:27.290,皇后娘娘连夜命臣妾过来,00:13:26.420,00:13:28.340,Your Majesty summoned me urgently.
00:13:27.840,00:13:29.000,不知道所为何事,00:13:28.800,00:13:30.060,I await your orders.
00:13:30.260,00:13:33.350,本宫觉得今夜的事 事出蹊跷,00:13:31.280,00:13:34.280,Something is strange about what happened tonight.
00:13:33.730,00:13:35.390,本宫总是放心不下,00:13:34.700,00:13:36.840,I can't put my mind at peace.
00:13:38.150,00:13:39.390,臣妾也觉得是,00:13:38.880,00:13:40.680,I agree with Your Majesty.
00:13:40.440,00:13:42.680,颂芝再怎么得宠,,,
00:13:43.280,00:13:45.230,皇上也不至于生气,00:13:41.440,00:13:47.840,"No matter how much His Majesty favors Song Zhi,
he would not get angry at Concubine Sourire."
00:13:45.530,00:13:46.770,便生莞嫔的气啊,,,
00:13:47.450,00:13:48.440,莞嫔的父亲,,,
00:13:48.740,00:13:50.450,是弹勤年羹尧最多的人,00:13:48.340,00:13:51.380,"Concubine Sourire's father has
repeatedly denounced Nian Gengyao."
00:13:51.830,00:13:54.860,皇上护着颂芝便是护着华妃,00:13:52.560,00:13:55.920,"Defending Song Zhi means
His Majesty is defending Consort Fleur."
00:13:55.870,00:13:57.950,难道皇上是圣心转圆,00:13:56.760,00:13:59.060,Could it be that His Majesty has had a change of heart?
00:13:58.250,00:14:01.540,还是想要护着年羹尧的缘故呢,00:13:59.120,00:14:02.400,And now wants to maintain Nian Gengyao?
00:14:02.340,00:14:03.450,若真是如此,00:14:03.280,00:14:04.760,"If that's the case,"
00:14:04.170,00:14:08.260,莞嫔岂不是再无回天之力了,00:14:05.000,00:14:09.360,"then Concubine Sourire will no longer
be capable of turning the tides."
00:14:10.010,00:14:10.970,莞嫔失宠,,,
00:14:11.180,00:14:13.550,甄远道也会后继无力,00:14:10.880,00:14:14.480,"If Concubine Sourire falls out of favor,
Zhen Yuandao will also lose support."
00:14:14.140,00:14:17.260,便再无人可以抗衡年羹尧了,00:14:14.980,00:14:18.260,And no one else can contend against Nian Gengyao.
00:14:18.230,00:14:21.190,本宫断不能眼见如此啊,00:14:19.160,00:14:22.420,I can't just watch and allow this to happen.
00:14:22.070,00:14:24.230,那娘娘以为如何,00:14:22.940,00:14:25.300,What does Your Majesty intend to do?
00:14:25.820,00:14:28.610,眼下年羹尧虽然屡遭弹勤,00:14:26.740,00:14:29.660,Although Nian Gengyao has been continually denounced
00:14:29.070,00:14:30.610,皇上也偶有斥责,00:14:29.920,00:14:31.900,"and His Majesty has condemned him a few times,"
00:14:30.990,00:14:33.820,可是从来都没有责罚过什么,00:14:31.900,00:14:34.820,there has never been any actual punishment.
00:14:34.870,00:14:37.780,而华妃在宫中势气又盛,00:14:35.780,00:14:39.140,With Consort Fleur flourishing in the palace ...
00:14:38.920,00:14:40.370,与其莞嫔去后,,,
00:14:40.540,00:14:42.120,华妃便会盯住你不放,00:14:39.940,00:14:43.320,"Rather than having you be her next target,"
00:14:43.420,00:14:45.880,倒不如你陪着莞嫔,00:14:44.380,00:14:47.000,"I think it's best for you to
be there with Concubine Sourire."
00:14:46.130,00:14:49.250,也好静观其变 如何呢,00:14:47.000,00:14:48.960,It will give us time to see what unfolds.
,,,00:14:49.120,00:14:50.480,What do you think?
00:14:52.300,00:14:54.010,若莞嫔一去不复返,00:14:53.180,00:14:55.400,But what if she is never allowed to return?
00:14:54.680,00:14:58.050,臣妾岂不是要陪她永住蓬莱洲,00:14:55.600,00:14:58.780,Won't that mean I'll have to stay there with her forever?
00:14:58.310,00:14:59.140,你放心,00:14:59.140,00:15:00.280,Don't worry about that.
00:14:59.730,00:15:01.930,到时你想住蓬莱洲当神仙,00:15:00.600,00:15:03.020,"Even if you desired
""Taoist immortality on Penglai Mountain"""
00:15:02.270,00:15:03.850,本宫也会接你出去,00:15:03.200,00:15:05.320,I'd still bring you back to the palace.
00:15:04.980,00:15:07.690,只是这件事本宫总觉得,,,
00:15:08.360,00:15:11.690,你陪着莞嫔会好些,00:15:05.880,00:15:12.680,"All in all, I think it's best for you to
be there with Concubine Sourire."
00:15:15.160,00:15:19.650,是 臣妾去陪莞嫔姐姐就是了,00:15:15.880,00:15:17.560,"Yes, Your Majesty."
,,,00:15:17.640,00:15:20.480,I will join Concubine Sourire.
00:15:34.430,00:15:35.260,姐姐,00:15:35.300,00:15:36.500,Sourire!
00:15:41.230,00:15:42.470,你是来送我的吗,00:15:42.060,00:15:43.820,Are you here to send me off?
00:15:44.150,00:15:45.480,我已回禀了皇上,00:15:45.060,00:15:46.820,I have informed His Majesty.
00:15:46.190,00:15:47.930,与姐姐同去蓬莱洲居住,00:15:47.080,00:15:49.180,I'll be going to Penglai Island with you.
00:15:48.610,00:15:49.190,你说什么,,,
00:15:49.860,00:15:51.520,我与姐姐同去蓬莱洲,00:15:49.440,00:15:50.880,What are you talking about?
00:15:52.320,00:15:53.610,皇上已经应允了,00:15:50.880,00:15:52.900,I will live with you on Penglai Island.
00:15:54.200,00:15:56.230,所以妹妹不是来送姐姐的,00:15:53.340,00:15:55.160,His Majesty has granted me his consent.
,,,00:15:55.200,00:15:57.360,So I'm not here to send you off.
00:15:57.950,00:15:58.820,不许胡说,00:15:58.880,00:16:00.140,Nonsense.
00:16:00.250,00:16:02.860,你真以为到蓬莱洲是去成仙吗,00:16:00.940,00:16:04.040,"Do you really think you can achieve immortality
by living on Penglai Island?"
00:16:04.540,00:16:05.660,你若陪我一去,00:16:05.500,00:16:07.140,"If you accompany me there,"
00:16:06.380,00:16:08.620,怕是这宫中的前程算是断送了,00:16:07.360,00:16:09.940,I'm afraid it will ruin your future in the palace.
00:16:09.630,00:16:10.240,你何必陪我,,,
00:16:10.550,00:16:11.790,去过这样的苦日子呢,00:16:10.440,00:16:13.380,There's no need to endure hardship with me.
00:16:13.430,00:16:15.880,姐姐 陵容心里很明白,00:16:14.220,00:16:15.380,"Sourire,"
00:16:16.550,00:16:17.840,自妹妹承宠以来,00:16:15.560,00:16:18.860,"I'm well aware that ever since I gained favor,"
00:16:18.140,00:16:19.550,见罪于各宫嫔妃,00:16:19.120,00:16:21.100,I have displeased many of the concubines.
00:16:20.560,00:16:22.720,只有姐姐对我恩重如山,00:16:21.380,00:16:23.980,"Only you treated me with kindness
and it is ""heavy as a mountain."""
00:16:23.520,00:16:24.760,姐姐如今这一去,,,
00:16:25.610,00:16:26.890,妹妹与其在宫中,00:16:24.380,00:16:26.000,"Once you leave,"
00:16:27.150,00:16:30.020,继续看人眼色 受尽冷落苦楚,00:16:26.500,00:16:30.820,I will have to suffer through all their disdainful eye-rolling.
00:16:31.190,00:16:33.030,不如随姐姐一同去,00:16:32.140,00:16:34.320,I would rather accompany you
00:16:33.570,00:16:36.610,也好陪伴左右 互相有个照应,00:16:34.380,00:16:37.320,so we can look after each other there.
00:16:39.790,00:16:40.950,恭喜娘娘了,,,
00:16:41.450,00:16:42.790,去了一个心腹大患,00:16:40.600,00:16:42.260,I congratulate Your Highness
00:16:43.660,00:16:45.120,只是去了蓬莱洲,00:16:42.380,00:16:44.340,for getting rid of a potent threat.
,,,00:16:44.660,00:16:46.680,She has only been sent to Penglai Island.
00:16:46.130,00:16:48.160,或许还会回来也未可知,00:16:46.980,00:16:49.140,which also sends a warning to Zhen Yuandao.
00:16:48.420,00:16:50.460,有颂芝妹妹在 怕什么,00:16:49.420,00:16:51.780,"Your Highness has Song Zhi.
There's nothing to worry about."
00:16:51.960,00:16:55.080,到了适当的时候 再拨上几句,00:16:52.760,00:16:56.520,"Just drive another wedge between Concubine Sourire
and His Majesty when it's time."
00:16:55.930,00:16:57.090,也就差不离了,00:16:56.760,00:16:58.440,And that should be enough.
00:16:57.640,00:16:59.000,这些都不要紧,00:16:58.640,00:17:00.180,That is not important now.
00:16:59.680,00:17:02.390,要紧的是 皇上痛斥了莞嫔,00:17:00.620,00:17:03.520,"What's important is His Majesty has
condemned Concubine Sourire,"
00:17:02.980,00:17:05.060,也算给了甄远道一个教训,00:17:03.860,00:17:06.260,which also sends a warning to Zhen Yuandao.
00:17:06.020,00:17:07.810,哥哥也好放松些,00:17:06.940,00:17:09.380,My brother can now relax his vigilance.
00:17:10.820,00:17:14.310,顺带着还去了一个安贵人呢,00:17:11.840,00:17:15.640,"Not to mention, Lady An is now gone as well."
00:17:15.320,00:17:16.900,打压了皇后的气焰,00:17:16.060,00:17:18.560,This has clamped down on the Empress's power.
00:17:18.620,00:17:20.980,像安陵容这种没有家世的女子,00:17:19.500,00:17:22.200,An Lingrong has no family background to rely on.
00:17:21.540,00:17:22.740,唱破了喉咙,,,
00:17:23.040,00:17:24.570,也只是个歌伎的料子,00:17:22.500,00:17:26.220,"She can sing until she loses her voice, but she
is still nothing more than an entertainer."
00:17:25.670,00:17:28.330,皇上宠她一时是她的福气,00:17:26.700,00:17:29.820,"She was fortunate enough to gain even
a moment of His Majesty's favor."
00:17:29.290,00:17:31.450,还指望这福气能一辈子吗,00:17:30.320,00:17:33.000,"Does she think she will be so fortunate
for the rest of her life?"
00:17:35.420,00:17:37.760,要说这次的事,00:17:36.380,00:17:37.720,"Speaking of which,"
00:17:38.180,00:17:40.010,多亏了娘娘筹谋得当,00:17:37.720,00:17:40.800,"this outcome is all thanks to
Your Highness's well-executed plan,"
00:17:40.350,00:17:42.630,再加上芝答应又得宠,00:17:41.140,00:17:43.900,"and also, Companion Zhi being in favor."
00:17:43.520,00:17:46.600,否则嫔妾还真怕功亏一姜呢,00:17:44.520,00:17:47.600,"Otherwise our efforts would
have been in vain."
00:17:46.890,00:17:48.850,芝答应是得皇上青眼,00:17:47.840,00:17:50.200,It's true Companion Zhi is in His Majesty's good graces.
00:17:49.400,00:17:52.060,什么时候能封个常在就更好了,00:17:50.300,00:17:53.140,"Now if she can be promoted to Attendant,
that would be even better."
00:17:53.650,00:17:57.240,是啊 要是再能添上一男半女,00:17:54.640,00:17:58.240,"And if she was to have a child,"
00:17:57.610,00:18:00.820,跟姐姐我也就能平起平坐了,00:17:58.440,00:18:01.880,she would even be on equal footing with me.
00:18:03.540,00:18:04.780,曹贵人别抬举我了,,,
00:18:05.450,00:18:06.440,我再得什么封赏,00:18:04.420,00:18:06.260,"You're flattering me, Lady Cao."
00:18:06.750,00:18:07.660,都是娘娘的奴婢,00:18:06.400,00:18:08.780,"I will forever be Your Highness's servant
regardless of my own status."
00:18:08.120,00:18:09.280,至死不敢忘的,00:18:08.960,00:18:10.860,I'll remember until the day I die.
00:18:11.790,00:18:12.750,知道就好,00:18:12.680,00:18:14.520,I'm glad you know your place.
00:18:17.010,00:18:17.750,开船,00:18:17.960,00:18:19.180,Depart.
00:18:23.970,00:18:26.260,出入蓬莱洲就这么一条水路了,00:18:24.600,00:18:27.300,There is only one way in or out of Penglai Island.
00:18:26.850,00:18:29.430,船要是撤了 人就困在这儿了,,,
00:18:29.850,00:18:31.190,上不去也下不来,00:18:28.040,00:18:32.120,"With the boats taken away, there’s
no way to leave or enter."
00:18:32.570,00:18:33.480,多谢皇上,,,
00:18:33.770,00:18:35.180,给我这么一个清静的地方,00:18:33.180,00:18:37.220,"I’m thankful to His Majesty for assigning
me to such a peaceful place."

00:19:00.760,00:19:02.500,虽然不能与碧桐书院相比,00:19:01.540,00:19:03.400,It can’t be compared to Verdant Reading Hall.
00:19:02.890,00:19:04.720,但所幸也不算太荒芜失修,00:19:03.460,00:19:06.020,"But fortunately, it’s neither desolate nor neglected."
00:19:06.180,00:19:09.050,我还以为蓬莱洲早已破败不堪,00:19:07.100,00:19:10.460,"I thought Penglai Island had become uninhabitable,"
00:19:09.730,00:19:12.090,看样子还算清爽整洁,00:19:10.780,00:19:13.260,but it seems to be clean and orderly.
00:19:13.400,00:19:14.930,皇上虽然听信华妃,,,
00:19:15.440,00:19:18.100,但是也不算一味苛待姐姐的,00:19:14.180,00:19:19.760,"Even though His Majesty has chosen to heed the
words of Consort Fleur, he’s not mistreating you."
00:19:18.990,00:19:21.190,这地方收拾得如此干净利落,,,
00:19:21.660,00:19:23.440,本宫知道是公公费心了,00:19:20.360,00:19:24.040,"Mr. Su, I know it’s because of your efforts that
this place is so tidy and neat."
00:19:23.780,00:19:24.740,在此谢过公公,00:19:24.480,00:19:26.100,"I extend my thanks to you, sir."
00:19:25.700,00:19:28.160,娘娘 您昔日对待奴才,00:19:26.480,00:19:30.400,Your Highness has always been generous to me.
00:19:28.660,00:19:29.570,颇为照顾,,,
00:19:30.290,00:19:31.530,今日娘娘遭难,,,
00:19:31.790,00:19:33.910,奴才只不过是尽一点心意罢了,00:19:30.820,00:19:35.220,"Today is but a small token of my gratitude
during this difficult time."
00:19:34.420,00:19:35.830,只盼日后还有机会,,,
00:19:36.210,00:19:37.290,能够再服侍娘娘,00:19:35.400,00:19:38.480,"I’m looking forward to the day when
I can serve Your Highness again."
00:19:39.510,00:19:42.040,你看 姐姐平日待人的心,,,
00:19:42.300,00:19:43.630,今日总算有回报了,00:19:40.420,00:19:44.720,"See, Sourire, your kindness to others is
coming back to you today."
00:19:44.180,00:19:46.540,就连妹妹我也跟着沾了不少光,00:19:45.100,00:19:47.420,Even I benefit from your kindness.
00:19:47.140,00:19:47.800,好说,00:19:47.660,00:19:48.940,It’s nothing.
00:19:48.270,00:19:50.680,娘娘 奴才不能多逗留,00:19:49.300,00:19:52.020,"I have to leave soon, Your Highness."
00:19:51.060,00:19:52.850,以后一应供应的东西,,,
00:19:53.100,00:19:54.340,奴才会派人送过来,00:19:52.180,00:19:55.660,I will have household supplies sent here.
00:19:55.860,00:19:56.770,天色不早了,00:19:56.780,00:19:58.160,It will be dark soon.
00:19:57.270,00:19:59.060,二位小主早些歇息吧,00:19:58.200,00:20:00.120,"You should get settled, My Ladies."
00:19:59.570,00:20:00.310,有劳公公,00:20:00.380,00:20:02.000,"Thank you, sir."
00:20:07.370,00:20:08.530,姐姐别太灰心了,,,
00:20:09.580,00:20:11.530,我怎么觉得 皇上现在,00:20:08.260,00:20:10.180,"Sourire, don’t feel too discouraged."
00:20:11.870,00:20:13.530,只是一时受了蒙蔽而已,00:20:10.540,00:20:14.620,"For some reason, I feel that His Majesty
 still cares about you in his heart."
00:20:13.960,00:20:16.070,心里还是很疼姐姐的,00:20:14.800,00:20:17.180,He is only being deceived for now.
00:20:16.960,00:20:17.920,指不定哪天,,,
00:20:18.590,00:20:20.420,就派人接姐姐出去了呢,00:20:17.900,00:20:21.360,His Majesty may send for you again someday.
00:20:21.050,00:20:23.760,我没事 只是为难你,00:20:22.080,00:20:23.280,I am fine.
00:20:24.090,00:20:25.300,也跟着我一起受苦,00:20:23.540,00:20:26.500,It’s just unfair for you to be suffering with me.
00:20:26.850,00:20:28.430,你怎么只带了宝鹃一个人,00:20:27.620,00:20:29.440,How come only Coua is here with you?
00:20:28.680,00:20:31.010,菊青呢一个人够伺候吗,00:20:29.660,00:20:32.160,Where is Daisy? Is one servant enough?
00:20:31.730,00:20:33.090,宝鹃伺候我最久了,,,
00:20:33.390,00:20:34.180,也使唤惯了,00:20:32.640,00:20:34.060,Coua has been with me the longest.
00:20:34.900,00:20:36.890,菊青是姐姐赏给我的丫头,00:20:34.060,00:20:35.800,I am used to being served by her.
00:20:37.360,00:20:38.720,哪里舍得带她来这里,00:20:35.940,00:20:38.140,You granted Daisy to me.
00:20:39.440,00:20:40.850,让她看守闲月阁了,00:20:38.200,00:20:40.240,I couldn’t bear to have her go through this with me.
00:20:42.030,00:20:43.270,不过姐姐放心,00:20:40.420,00:20:42.880,"She’s back at Leisured Moon Chamber,
keeping an eye on things."
00:20:43.990,00:20:45.650,我也会些针线上的功夫,00:20:43.080,00:20:46.680,"Don’t worry, at least I have some skills in sewing."
00:20:46.120,00:20:47.980,一切自己动手就是了,00:20:47.020,00:20:49.320,I will handle things myself.
00:20:49.200,00:20:50.190,真是为难你了,00:20:50.000,00:20:51.940,Sorry to make things difficult for you.
00:20:52.870,00:20:54.780,敬妃娘娘请安,00:20:53.620,00:20:56.300,Consort Estime to pay her respects!

00:21:00.300,00:21:02.160,莞嫔已经去了蓬莱洲了,00:21:01.140,00:21:03.740,Lady Sourire has already arrived at Penglai Island.
00:21:03.300,00:21:04.160,起来吧,00:21:04.360,00:21:05.620,You may rise.
00:21:05.890,00:21:08.630,咱们一场姐妹都不能去送送,00:21:06.880,00:21:09.620,We can’t even see her off as sisters.
00:21:09.390,00:21:11.720,还是安贵人有情有义啊,,,
00:21:11.970,00:21:12.960,还跟着去了,00:21:10.200,00:21:14.020,"Noble Lady An is loyal, to the point of going with her."
00:21:14.350,00:21:17.470,也好 眼下华妃这个样子,00:21:15.260,00:21:17.820,"Given Consort Fleur's current status,"
00:21:18.150,00:21:20.310,能走多远就走多远吧,00:21:18.540,00:21:21.520,it’s not a bad choice to get as far away as possible.
00:21:20.650,00:21:23.610,咱们也算眼不见为净,00:21:21.620,00:21:24.600,She can't harm what she can't see.
00:21:24.450,00:21:26.110,还是咱们留在这里,,,
00:21:26.360,00:21:28.730,看人家眼色做人更难哪,00:21:25.500,00:21:30.160,"It’s actually us who suffer more, having to live with
Consort Fleur’s moods and attitudes."
00:21:31.450,00:21:33.780,娘娘这么说 叫臣妾如何敢当,00:21:32.220,00:21:35.020,"Hearing Your Majesty's saying so
is unbearable to us concubines."
00:21:34.160,00:21:36.910,宫中万事还靠娘娘做主呢,00:21:35.160,00:21:37.960,"Everything in the harem
relies on Your Majesty's authority."
00:21:38.080,00:21:39.790,本宫还有什么能耐,00:21:39.140,00:21:40.940,What can I do?
00:21:40.290,00:21:42.410,不过是由着华妃踩在头上,,,
00:21:42.760,00:21:43.790,任她凌辱,00:21:41.160,00:21:44.820,Consort Fleur already walks all over me as she pleases.
00:21:44.630,00:21:45.500,那也未必,00:21:45.540,00:21:46.540,Not exactly.
00:21:46.220,00:21:48.670,皇上虽然宠着华妃和芝答应,00:21:47.160,00:21:50.060,"Even though His Majesty spoils
Consort Fleur and Companion Zhi,"
00:21:49.350,00:21:51.760,可在外头对年羹尧那头,,,
00:21:52.060,00:21:53.010,倒也不含糊呢,00:21:50.360,00:21:54.060,he is unequivocal with Nian Gengyao.
00:21:53.930,00:21:55.260,娘娘怕她做什么,,,
00:21:55.850,00:21:57.090,娘娘是后宫之主,00:21:54.760,00:21:56.720,What does Your Highness have to worry about?
00:21:57.390,00:21:58.260,咱们都听您的,00:21:56.720,00:21:59.300,"Your Majesty is the head of the Imperial Harem,
and we all obey your orders."
00:21:58.560,00:22:00.600,她一个人撑不起这戏台来,00:21:59.400,00:22:02.160,"Consort Fleur cannot ""perform an
opera as the only actor on stage."""
00:22:03.360,00:22:04.390,本宫知道,00:22:04.200,00:22:05.740,I understand
00:22:05.190,00:22:07.030,也幸亏还有你们罢了,00:22:05.980,00:22:08.040,and I'm fortunate to have you all here.
00:22:08.110,00:22:10.200,莞嫔和安贵人都走了,00:22:09.000,00:22:11.800,"With Concubine Sourire and Lady An gone,"
00:22:11.160,00:22:12.940,要是我们再不同心,00:22:12.040,00:22:14.080,"if we don’t remain united in one mind,"
00:22:13.620,00:22:17.240,恐怕下次去蓬莱洲的便是我们了,00:22:14.760,00:22:18.220,I’m afraid we will be next to be sent to Penglai Island.
00:22:18.420,00:22:23.580,臣妾等唯娘娘马首是瞻,00:22:19.120,00:22:21.760,We will only obey Your Majesty!
,,,00:22:22.180,00:22:24.840,We will only obey Your Majesty!
00:22:25.260,00:22:28.250,行了 都起来吧,00:22:26.320,00:22:27.640,I know.
,,,00:22:28.200,00:22:29.520,All rise.
00:22:29.800,00:22:30.710,谢娘娘,00:22:30.600,00:22:31.940,I thank Your Majesty.
00:22:36.180,00:22:38.300,奴才周甯海给皇后请安,00:22:37.060,00:22:39.880,Zhou Ninghai bows in respect before Your Majesty.
00:22:40.190,00:22:41.270,启禀皇后娘娘,00:22:41.080,00:22:42.560,"Your Majesty,"
00:22:41.940,00:22:44.310,华妃娘娘今日要陪皇上用膳,,,
00:22:45.030,00:22:46.310,就不能来请安了,00:22:42.900,00:22:48.000,"Consort Fleur will accompany His Majesty during
breakfast and cannot pay her respects today."
00:22:47.280,00:22:49.940,还请皇后娘娘见谅,00:22:48.240,00:22:51.080,She hopes Your Majesty understands.
00:22:50.820,00:22:52.980,她不来 那芝答应呢,00:22:51.740,00:22:54.080,What about Companion Zhi?
00:22:54.240,00:22:56.610,芝答应陪侍 也不能来了,00:22:55.080,00:22:58.360,"Companion Zhi is also serving His Majesty.
She is also unable to come."
00:22:57.910,00:22:58.740,皇后娘娘,,,
00:22:59.250,00:23:01.080,像日常请安这种小事情,00:22:58.880,00:23:02.160,I don’t think Your Majesty will mind
00:23:02.250,00:23:04.740,皇后娘娘不会介意吧,00:23:03.300,00:23:06.600,"absence from such trivial matters
as paying daily respects."
00:23:06.510,00:23:09.670,请安是小事 那什么是大事,00:23:07.320,00:23:11.220,"If paying respects is trivial, then what is important?"
00:23:09.970,00:23:10.420,这,,,
00:23:10.630,00:23:12.470,罢了 欣常在,00:23:11.480,00:23:13.740,"It's all right, Attendant Joie."
00:23:13.100,00:23:15.260,皇上的事才算是大事,00:23:14.040,00:23:16.360,His Majesty’s affairs are the most important.
00:23:16.850,00:23:19.180,周宁海 你退下吧,00:23:17.460,00:23:20.180,"Zhou Ninghai, you may leave now."
00:23:19.810,00:23:23.020,谢皇后娘娘 奴才告退,00:23:20.720,00:23:24.140,"Allow me to take my leave, Your Majesty."
00:23:34.450,00:23:37.910,快入秋了 圣驾也快回奎了吧,00:23:35.500,00:23:36.820,Autumn is coming.
,,,00:23:36.940,00:23:39.040,"His Majesty is coming back soon, right?"
00:23:38.750,00:23:41.200,快了 听说下月初就回来了,00:23:39.740,00:23:42.540,"Yes, I heard that His Majesty is
coming back early next month."
00:23:43.080,00:23:44.740,那敬妃也快回来了,00:23:44.020,00:23:46.140,So Consort Estime will be back soon too?
00:23:46.210,00:23:48.120,敬妃娘娘是快回来了,00:23:47.140,00:23:49.240,"Yes, Her Highness is coming back soon."
00:23:48.760,00:23:50.540,可是莞嫔娘娘却回不来,00:23:49.640,00:23:51.620,"However, Concubine Sourire won’t be returning."
00:23:51.010,00:23:51.670,什么,00:23:51.880,00:23:52.920,What did you say?
00:23:52.180,00:23:54.130,奴婢一直没敢跟小主说,00:23:53.080,00:23:55.220,"I didn’t dare tell you, My Lady."
00:23:54.550,00:23:56.380,莞嫔娘娘见罪于圣上,00:23:55.500,00:23:57.420,"Lady Sourire enraged His Majesty,"
00:23:56.850,00:23:58.180,被发落到蓬莱洲了,00:23:57.600,00:23:59.560,and was banished to Penglai Island.
00:23:58.890,00:24:02.220,蓬莱洲 那里可比冷宫还不如,00:23:59.860,00:24:03.280,Penglai Island is even worse than the Cold Palace.
00:24:02.650,00:24:03.890,像坐牢一样,00:24:03.540,00:24:05.020,It’s more like a jail.
00:24:04.770,00:24:07.980,就是啊 听说皇上快回奎了,00:24:05.700,00:24:06.960,That’s right.
00:24:08.480,00:24:10.220,可是也没有人打扫碎玉轩,00:24:07.020,00:24:11.300,"I heard that no one is cleaning the Palace of Pearl Jade
even though His Majesty is returning soon."
00:24:10.990,00:24:13.480,恐怕莞嫔娘娘这次是回不来了,00:24:12.000,00:24:14.940,"I'm afraid that Lady Sourire won’t be
coming back this time."
00:24:14.910,00:24:16.990,莞嫔娘娘孤零零地在行宫里,,,
00:24:17.280,00:24:19.620,什么东西都没有 多可怜哪,00:24:15.920,00:24:19.280,"Lady Sourire is there by herself, without anything."
00:24:20.580,00:24:22.370,还不知道现在怎么样了呢,00:24:19.620,00:24:21.080,How pitiful!
00:24:26.000,00:24:28.240,小主 不如我们托人,00:24:21.600,00:24:23.780,I wonder how she is managing.
00:24:28.500,00:24:29.410,送点东西去,00:24:26.660,00:24:30.700,"My Lady, perhaps we could have
someone send some supplies over?"
00:24:31.420,00:24:32.880,她从前那样得宠,,,
00:24:33.090,00:24:34.250,什么好东西没有,00:24:32.280,00:24:35.300,She used to be favored by His Majesty so much.
00:24:34.720,00:24:35.670,还缺咱们的吗,00:24:35.580,00:24:37.780,Why would she need anything that we have?
00:25:05.460,00:25:06.910,姐姐是在想皇上呢吗,00:25:06.440,00:25:08.780,"Were you thinking of His Majesty, Sourire?"
00:25:09.670,00:25:12.710,无事可想 想一想自己罢了,00:25:10.160,00:25:12.340,"No, nothing particular,"
,,,00:25:12.680,00:25:14.760,just thinking about myself.
00:25:16.180,00:25:18.670,皇上怕是已经把我们忘了吧,00:25:17.160,00:25:19.880,I’m afraid His Majesty has forgotten all about us.
00:25:19.600,00:25:22.300,忘与不忘 咱们哪里能知道呢,00:25:20.480,00:25:23.500,How could we know whether he has or not?
00:25:25.390,00:25:26.680,姐姐也别太难过了,00:25:26.380,00:25:27.920,Don’t be so upset.
00:25:27.900,00:25:30.310,我炖了螂鱼豆腐 马上就好了,00:25:28.880,00:25:31.300,The carp tofu soup I am making is almost ready.
00:25:30.860,00:25:31.810,姐姐进去吃吧,00:25:31.780,00:25:33.140,Let’s go eat.
00:25:32.940,00:25:34.810,你先进去 我一会儿就来,00:25:33.760,00:25:36.540,"You go ahead first, I’ll join you in a bit."
00:26:02.510,00:26:03.130,快,00:26:03.460,00:26:04.560,Quickly.
00:26:05.850,00:26:06.930,苏公公 给娘娘请安,00:26:06.920,00:26:08.940,"- Mr. Su.
- Peace to Your Highness."
00:26:08.940,00:26:11.220,娘娘 快入秋了,00:26:09.940,00:26:12.300,"Your Highness, it is becoming autumn."
00:26:11.980,00:26:13.640,娘娘没带的几件秋衣,,,
00:26:14.320,00:26:15.900,惠贵人从宫里托人,00:26:12.940,00:26:15.240,Your Highness did not bring any fall clothing with you.
00:26:16.240,00:26:17.730,送来了秋衣和东西,00:26:15.340,00:26:18.720,So Lady Vertu sent over some clothes and sundries.
00:26:19.360,00:26:21.070,难得眉姐姐还肯惦记我,00:26:20.300,00:26:22.840,I appreciate that Meizhuang is still thinking about me.
00:26:22.410,00:26:23.650,您瞧这惠贵人,,,
00:26:23.910,00:26:25.820,那可真是刀子嘴豆腐心哪,00:26:23.380,00:26:25.180,That’s Noble Lady Vertu.
00:26:26.410,00:26:28.030,说是要送给安贵人的,00:26:25.220,00:26:27.340,Her words may be harsh but her heart is kind.
00:26:28.460,00:26:29.990,其实都备了两份,00:26:27.500,00:26:31.100,"She told us it was meant for Lady An,
but everything came in pairs."
00:26:30.380,00:26:31.910,哪有不记挂娘娘呢,00:26:31.320,00:26:33.400,She hasn’t forgotten about Your Highness.
00:26:34.550,00:26:37.380,娘娘可好 皇上记挂得很哪,00:26:35.560,00:26:38.360,"How is Your Highness?
His Majesty worries a lot about you."
00:26:37.670,00:26:40.090,本宫很好 请公公转告皇上,00:26:38.560,00:26:41.160,"I am very well, please convey that to His Majesty."
00:26:40.390,00:26:41.040,是,,,
00:26:41.390,00:26:42.130,皇上好吗,00:26:41.320,00:26:42.260,Yes.
00:26:42.470,00:26:43.180,皇上好,00:26:42.260,00:26:44.340,"- And how is His Majesty?
- He is well!"
00:26:43.640,00:26:44.500,一切都好吗,00:26:44.540,00:26:45.900,And is everything going well?
00:26:45.220,00:26:47.970,皇上一切顺遂 请娘娘放心吧,00:26:46.220,00:26:49.040,"Indeed they are, Your Highness.
Please rest easy."
00:26:48.440,00:26:49.140,那就好,,,
00:26:50.310,00:26:52.350,娘娘 奴才这次来,00:26:49.360,00:26:50.680,That’s good.
00:26:52.820,00:26:54.060,是要告诉娘娘,,,
00:26:54.730,00:26:56.940,皇上明日就要回奎了,00:26:51.360,00:26:58.060,"Your Highness, I came here to inform you that
His Majesty is returning to the palace tomorrow."
00:26:58.490,00:26:59.850,京中不知情形如何,00:26:59.380,00:27:01.160,We don’t know about the situation in the capital.
00:27:00.450,00:27:02.900,有劳公公一定好生服侍皇上,00:27:01.460,00:27:03.840,Please take good care of His Majesty.
00:27:03.160,00:27:06.240,奴才知道 奴才明日就要走了,00:27:03.900,00:27:04.760,I will.
,,,00:27:05.740,00:27:07.560,I am also leaving tomorrow.
00:27:07.040,00:27:10.280,奴才的徒弟小厦子人还算机灵,00:27:08.040,00:27:09.820,"This is my apprentice, Xiao-Xiazi."
,,,00:27:10.120,00:27:11.400,He is pretty clever.
00:27:10.710,00:27:13.450,以后就由他来为娘娘送东西,00:27:11.680,00:27:14.420,"He will be in charge of sending things to
Your Highness in the future."
00:27:15.210,00:27:16.670,万一到了京城有什么不好,,,
00:27:17.800,00:27:19.160,一定要派人来告诉本宫,00:27:16.160,00:27:18.580,"Heaven forbid, but if anything goes wrong in the capital,"
00:27:20.050,00:27:21.540,皇上就是担心娘娘,00:27:18.820,00:27:20.780,you must send someone to inform me.
00:27:21.840,00:27:23.050,首当其冲受害,00:27:21.200,00:27:24.220,"His Majesty's greatest fear is that
Your Highness would be harmed,"
00:27:23.510,00:27:25.590,所以才让娘娘避开这阵子的,00:27:24.360,00:27:26.800,which is why he sent you here for the time being.
00:27:26.720,00:27:29.970,本宫只愿皇上能顺遂平安就好,00:27:27.720,00:27:30.860,My only wish is for His Majesty to be safe and well.
00:27:30.350,00:27:32.840,一定会的 奴才不宜久留,00:27:31.180,00:27:33.740,He will be. I can’t stay for too long.
00:27:33.230,00:27:34.220,这就先告辞了,00:27:34.140,00:27:35.500,Allow me to take my leave.
00:27:35.020,00:27:35.680,好,00:27:35.960,00:27:36.980,Yes.
00:27:53.210,00:27:53.790,你回来啦,,,
00:27:54.000,00:27:55.120,皇上 快马加鞭,00:27:54.300,00:27:55.520,"- You are back.
- Your Majesty."
00:27:55.460,00:27:56.700,臣弟截下了这个,00:27:55.620,00:27:58.200,"I came urgently because
I intercepted this message."
00:27:59.420,00:28:00.750,这是从敦亲王府里的信鸽上,,,
00:28:01.050,00:28:01.710,截下来的,00:28:00.260,00:28:03.240,"It's from a carrier pigeon that left
State Prince Dun’s residence."
00:28:06.050,00:28:08.970,敦亲王果然劝年羹尧相助,00:28:06.920,00:28:10.580,"As I expected, State Prince Dun is
asking Nian Gengyao for assistance"
00:28:10.020,00:28:11.220,夺了朕的皇位,00:28:11.020,00:28:12.480,in usurping my throne.
00:28:12.480,00:28:13.720,迎允禩为帝,00:28:13.380,00:28:15.500,"They will make Yunsi [Lord VIII] the emperor,"
00:28:14.690,00:28:17.180,允禟之母宜太妃为太后,00:28:15.660,00:28:19.140,"and Yuntang's [Lord IX] mother
Consort Dowager Bonheur the Empress Dowager."
00:28:18.320,00:28:20.230,看十哥的成算 也必不能成,00:28:19.240,00:28:21.700,"Given that this is State Prince Dun,
there is no chance he will succeed."
00:28:20.740,00:28:24.020,他若能成事 岂非天亡我大清,00:28:21.780,00:28:25.300,"If he is successful, Heaven must not favor the Great Qing."
00:28:24.990,00:28:25.600,来人,00:28:25.880,00:28:26.960,Xia Yi!
00:28:28.790,00:28:29.400,皇上,,,
00:28:30.700,00:28:32.370,吩咐你手底下的血滴子,00:28:29.720,00:28:30.800,Your Majesty.
00:28:33.170,00:28:35.280,替朕暗中看住敦亲王府,00:28:31.600,00:28:36.260,"Tell your people in the Flying Guillotine
to secretly surveil State Prince Dun’s estate."
00:28:36.540,00:28:38.880,朕今夜便要派骁骑营大军,,,
00:28:39.210,00:28:40.620,夜围王府 拿下所有人,00:28:37.400,00:28:41.440,"I will send the Valiant Cavalry there
and have everyone arrested tonight!"
00:28:40.800,00:28:41.410,嗻,00:28:41.780,00:28:42.540,Yes.
00:28:43.680,00:28:45.960,这件事有劳你了,00:28:44.420,00:28:47.060,I appreciate your effort.
00:28:46.510,00:28:47.970,臣弟只是尽微薄之力,00:28:47.340,00:28:49.040,I am only doing what little I’m capable of.
00:28:48.220,00:28:50.880,也只有你来往敦亲王府外,,,
00:28:51.230,00:28:52.210,旁人才不疑心,00:28:49.300,00:28:53.240,"You are the only person who can visit State Prince
Dun’s residence without causing suspicion."
00:28:52.770,00:28:54.880,人赃并获 才能师出有名,00:28:53.640,00:28:56.240,The evidence fully justifies the deployment of forces.
00:28:55.480,00:28:59.220,今夜你便替朕看住敦亲王府,00:28:56.500,00:29:00.260,"Keep watch over State Prince Dun’s
residence for me tonight."
00:28:59.900,00:29:02.230,有什么消息即刻来见朕,00:29:00.760,00:29:03.220,Come to me immediately if anything goes wrong.
00:29:02.610,00:29:03.230,是,00:29:03.580,00:29:04.540,Yes.
00:29:07.820,00:29:08.440,苏培盛,00:29:08.660,00:29:09.740,Su Peisheng.
00:29:10.950,00:29:11.610,奴才在,00:29:11.800,00:29:12.900,Your Majesty.
00:29:12.040,00:29:16.000,去告诉太后 今夜太后不适,00:29:13.020,00:29:14.800,Announce this to the Empress Dowager:
00:29:16.960,00:29:17.820,所以要请,00:29:15.340,00:29:17.280,“The Empress Dowager doesn’t feel well.
00:29:18.130,00:29:20.740,敦亲王福晋和贝子入宫,00:29:17.820,00:29:22.440,"State Prince Dun’s wife and son
are summoned to serve Her Majesty,"
00:29:21.960,00:29:25.630,一同陪恭定公主为太后侍疾,00:29:22.860,00:29:26.700,"together with Noble Princess Gongding
[Dun’s daughter who lives in the palace].”"
00:29:26.130,00:29:29.380,嗻 太后也已经吩咐过奴才了,00:29:27.080,00:29:28.520,As Your Majesty commands.
,,,00:29:28.520,00:29:30.500,Her Majesty has also given me the order.
00:29:34.560,00:29:36.220,皇上回奎快一个月了吧,00:29:35.600,00:29:37.760,"It has been almost a month since
His Majesty returned to the palace."
00:29:37.980,00:29:39.310,这么快就入秋了,00:29:38.980,00:29:40.780,It’s already become autumn so soon.
00:29:43.900,00:29:44.810,姐姐怎么了,00:29:44.780,00:29:46.120,What’s wrong?
00:29:46.660,00:29:48.440,拿着书手酸了,00:29:47.380,00:29:49.660,My hands got tired from holding the book.
00:29:56.160,00:29:58.910,怪不得 姐姐在看玄武门之变,00:29:53.320,00:29:55.060,[The Xuanwu Gate Incident]
00:29:59.580,00:30:00.570,难怪害怕了,00:29:57.060,00:30:01.940,"No wonder you are scared, this is about the
Xuanwu Gate Incident [a palace coup in Tang Dynasty]."
00:30:01.340,00:30:02.580,是我自己胆子小,00:30:02.140,00:30:04.040,I lost the courage to read it.
00:30:03.590,00:30:07.460,兄弟之争 不是你死就是我亡,00:30:04.440,00:30:08.440,"In wars between brothers, you win or you die."
00:30:08.680,00:30:10.790,胜者为王 败者为寇,00:30:09.600,00:30:12.320,"“The winner will be enthroned, and the losers outlawed.”"
00:30:11.600,00:30:14.130,生死荣辱不过这样罢了,00:30:12.560,00:30:15.460,"Life or death, glory or disgrace.
That is all they come to."
00:30:15.520,00:30:16.880,那是他们男人的荣辱,00:30:16.400,00:30:18.160,That is the province of men.
00:30:17.980,00:30:21.220,换作我们 生死 荣辱 尊卑,00:30:18.940,00:30:22.440,"For us women, life or death,
glory or disgrace, nobility or ordinary,"
00:30:21.820,00:30:22.900,皆是皇上给的,00:30:22.780,00:30:24.880,are all granted by His Majesty.
00:30:24.400,00:30:26.690,皇上荣耀时我们未必荣耀,00:30:25.140,00:30:27.880,"When His majesty enjoys glory, we might or might not,"
00:30:27.700,00:30:30.860,可皇上受辱时我们就一定受辱,00:30:28.480,00:30:31.840,"but when His Majesty suffers disgrace, we suffer along."
00:30:32.740,00:30:34.480,姐姐这样放不下皇上吗,00:30:33.600,00:30:35.860,Can you not let go of thoughts of His Majesty?
00:30:36.120,00:30:39.080,不是放不下 终究这些年,00:30:37.020,00:30:38.740,It’s not that I can't let go.
00:30:40.000,00:30:41.290,除了身家性命,00:30:39.020,00:30:40.460,"But after all these years,"
00:30:42.170,00:30:43.630,总还是有一些牵念的,00:30:40.900,00:30:42.900,I realize I've had more to care about
,,,00:30:43.120,00:30:45.060,aside from my life and my family.
00:30:45.420,00:30:46.540,终究这辈子,00:30:46.280,00:30:48.120,"And ultimately, for my whole life,"
00:30:47.670,00:30:49.040,也只有这一个男人了,00:30:48.580,00:30:50.560,this is who I'm married to.
00:30:51.600,00:30:52.430,是啊,00:30:52.600,00:30:53.820,Indeed.
00:30:54.720,00:30:56.880,最近姐姐总是心神不定的,00:30:55.640,00:30:57.800,Your mind seems ill at ease lately-
00:30:57.430,00:30:58.590,可是有什么心事吗,00:30:58.400,00:31:00.420,is there something troubling you?
00:31:04.730,00:31:06.390,灯花爆 喜事到,00:31:05.660,00:31:07.760,"""Good news follows when a candle sparks."""
00:31:07.030,00:31:08.480,任凭姐姐有什么心事,00:31:07.960,00:31:09.420,Whatever’s bothering you
00:31:08.740,00:31:09.650,也尽可以了了,00:31:09.480,00:31:10.780,will go away.
00:31:13.200,00:31:14.530,这流朱姑娘,,,
00:31:14.830,00:31:16.320,天一冷越发贪睡了,00:31:14.560,00:31:15.800,"Look at Vermilion,"
,,,00:31:15.800,00:31:17.640,she becomes much sleepier when the weather turns cold.
00:31:18.160,00:31:20.070,奴婢刚刚用炭盆喂了些芋头,00:31:19.000,00:31:20.880,I roasted some taro in the brazier.
00:31:20.330,00:31:21.070,趁热吃吧,00:31:21.080,00:31:22.400,Eat them while they are warm.
00:31:21.460,00:31:24.920,芋头 好久没吃过了,00:31:22.420,00:31:23.580,Taros!
00:31:25.250,00:31:28.090,从前在家还常吃呢 好香啊,00:31:24.700,00:31:27.800,"I haven’t had these in a long time.
We ate them all the time at home."
00:31:28.550,00:31:29.210,快吃吧,00:31:28.260,00:31:29.360,They smell delicious!
,,,00:31:29.380,00:31:30.520,Help yourself.
00:31:37.970,00:31:38.710,参见皇上,,,
00:31:39.350,00:31:39.930,如何,00:31:38.820,00:31:39.980,Your Majesty.
00:31:40.270,00:31:40.930,一切顺利,00:31:40.100,00:31:41.200,How did it go?
00:31:41.350,00:31:43.390,骁骑营已领人拿下了敦亲王,00:31:41.200,00:31:42.420,Everything went well.
,,,00:31:42.420,00:31:44.840,The Valiant Cavalry has detained State Prince Dun.
00:31:58.830,00:32:00.370,先帝在世的时候,00:31:59.860,00:32:02.040,"When the prior emperor was still alive,"
00:32:01.670,00:32:04.700,允禩 允禟 允饿狼狈为奸,00:32:02.240,00:32:05.840,"Yunsi, Yuntang, and Yun-e colluded in a heinous act,"
00:32:05.670,00:32:07.660,意图篡夺皇位,00:32:06.520,00:32:08.940,aiming to revolt against the throne.
00:32:09.300,00:32:11.160,允禩 允禟做得太过,00:32:10.200,00:32:12.160,Yunsi and Yuntang went too far and they failed.
00:32:11.680,00:32:12.760,事败削爵,00:32:12.460,00:32:14.400,Their noble titles were removed.
00:32:14.300,00:32:15.960,允饿不过跟从,00:32:15.340,00:32:17.460,Yun-e merely followed
00:32:16.640,00:32:19.930,后因温僖贵妃的缘故保全了下来,00:32:17.620,00:32:20.920,and was spared for the sake of Noble Consort Wenxi.
00:32:21.060,00:32:22.170,为了安抚他,,,
00:32:22.640,00:32:24.310,朕还封他为亲王,00:32:22.020,00:32:23.540,"To appease him,"
,,,00:32:23.540,00:32:25.700,"I even granted him the title of State Prince,"
00:32:25.020,00:32:26.600,可惜他太不知足,00:32:25.920,00:32:27.680,but he is much too greedy!
00:32:27.020,00:32:27.640,是啊,00:32:27.820,00:32:28.880,I agree.
00:32:32.860,00:32:34.820,今夜的事辛苦你了,00:32:33.940,00:32:36.060,You have worked hard tonight.
00:32:36.320,00:32:38.990,兄弟间最见不得人的事,,,
00:32:39.290,00:32:40.490,却让你亲眼看着,00:32:37.180,00:32:41.460,"It is unfortunate you have to witness
brothers turning against each other."
00:32:42.500,00:32:43.780,真是为难你了,00:32:43.420,00:32:45.280,It must be hard on you.
00:32:45.790,00:32:47.780,可是朝中亲贵诸多,00:32:46.700,00:32:49.840,"However, there are many more powerful
members in the imperial clan,"
00:32:49.340,00:32:51.250,朕希望允饿是最后一个,,,
00:32:51.590,00:32:52.710,有谋逆之心的人,00:32:50.300,00:32:53.740,I hope Yun-e is the last to harbor rebellious intentions
00:32:53.470,00:32:57.010,此后诸王都能安分守己,00:32:54.300,00:32:58.180,"and that all the lords will stay within
the bounds of duty from now on."
00:33:00.600,00:33:01.550,旁人不敢说,00:33:01.520,00:33:02.840,"I can’t speak for others,"
00:33:02.020,00:33:04.800,但臣弟却是第一风花雪月之人,00:33:02.980,00:33:05.700,"but my interests are ""wind, snow, flowers, and the moon."""
00:33:05.560,00:33:06.970,但求皇兄保全富贵,00:33:06.420,00:33:08.420,I hope Your Majesty's prosperity persists
00:33:07.980,00:33:10.060,以后别再让臣弟,00:33:08.820,00:33:09.880,so you won't
00:33:10.440,00:33:11.850,做这些惊心动魄的事了,00:33:10.400,00:33:12.920,assign me any more heart-wrenching matters.
00:33:12.490,00:33:13.820,你都已经这么说了,00:33:13.280,00:33:15.120,"Since you have said so,"
00:33:14.650,00:33:16.110,朕能不成全你吗,00:33:15.700,00:33:17.500,I will do you that favor.
00:33:19.330,00:33:20.070,谢皇兄,00:33:20.240,00:33:20.980,I thank Your Majesty.
00:33:32.260,00:33:33.370,安贵人还没起来吗,00:33:33.120,00:33:34.620,Has Companion An woken up yet?
00:33:33.840,00:33:36.710,昨晚做针线活做得有些晚了,00:33:34.740,00:33:37.620,She stayed up late doing needlework.
00:33:41.640,00:33:42.880,小主 快看,00:33:42.460,00:33:43.700,"My Lady, look!"
00:33:58.950,00:33:59.730,你这是干什么,,,
00:34:00.990,00:34:01.900,皇上叮嘱过,00:33:59.940,00:34:01.580,What are you doing?
00:34:02.160,00:34:03.320,凡事没有十足的把握,00:34:01.880,00:34:03.020,His Majesty told me
00:34:04.500,00:34:05.830,若有不测 我可以防身,00:34:03.060,00:34:04.420,nothing is completely certain.
,,,00:34:05.440,00:34:07.580,"If something unforeseen happens,
I should defend myself."
00:34:07.370,00:34:10.960,我答应过皇上 如果邪而侵正,00:34:07.980,00:34:09.960,"But I have promised his Majesty,"
00:34:12.170,00:34:12.910,我绝不苟活,00:34:10.900,00:34:12.700,"if the evil defeats the good,"
00:34:13.380,00:34:14.210,小主,00:34:12.880,00:34:14.060,I will not live on in shame.
00:34:20.050,00:34:21.290,皇上若真一败涂地,00:34:14.240,00:34:15.460,My Lady!
00:34:21.720,00:34:22.460,我也不能自保,00:34:21.020,00:34:24.180,"If his Majesty is defeated,
I won't be able to rescue myself."
00:34:23.560,00:34:25.220,与其来日备受凌辱与折磨,00:34:24.420,00:34:26.080,"Rather than being humiliated and tortured,"
00:34:26.430,00:34:27.300,我情愿一死,00:34:27.340,00:34:29.020,I would end my life.
00:34:46.790,00:34:49.750,小厦子 皇上可是一切无恙,00:34:47.840,00:34:48.940,Xiao-Xiazi!
00:34:50.210,00:34:52.120,皇上一切无恙 龙体康健,00:34:49.440,00:34:51.040,Is His Majesty safe?
00:34:52.500,00:34:54.080,娘娘 成了,00:34:51.060,00:34:53.780,"His Majesty is safe and well, Your Highness."
,,,00:34:54.540,00:34:55.780,It succeeded!
00:34:57.670,00:34:58.410,娘娘,00:34:58.520,00:34:59.740,Your Highness.
00:35:02.430,00:35:03.380,娘娘另U哭啊,,,
00:35:03.760,00:35:04.500,是大喜的事,00:35:03.340,00:35:04.540,"Don’t cry, Your Highness."
00:35:05.520,00:35:06.170,皇上口谕,00:35:04.600,00:35:05.920,It’s a joyous time.
00:35:06.470,00:35:08.590,让奴才迎娘娘和安贵人一起回宫,00:35:06.420,00:35:09.940,"His Majesty sends me to welcome Your Highness
and Lady An back to the palace."
00:35:09.230,00:35:10.060,赶紧着吧,00:35:10.180,00:35:11.520,Hurry and prepare!
00:35:20.530,00:35:25.070,一别两月 你可清瘦多了,00:35:21.420,00:35:23.040,We were parted for two months
,,,00:35:24.940,00:35:26.700,and you have slimmed down.
00:35:27.000,00:35:28.330,蓬莱洲与世隔绝,00:35:27.980,00:35:29.880,Penglai Island is very isolated.
00:35:29.290,00:35:31.120,臣妾日夜为四郎悬心,00:35:30.240,00:35:32.380,"I lost sleep worrying about you, Si Lang."
00:35:32.290,00:35:35.750,朕也是 所以你一回宫,00:35:33.240,00:35:34.520,I did too.
00:35:36.420,00:35:37.750,朕就赶着来看你,00:35:35.500,00:35:38.560,That's why I have come to see you immediately.
00:35:40.130,00:35:42.120,安贵人当真与你情重,00:35:41.060,00:35:43.440,Lady An is truly bonded with you.
00:35:44.180,00:35:46.090,知道你要囚禁蓬莱洲,00:35:45.280,00:35:47.320,"When she heard you were
to be confined on Penglai Island,"
00:35:46.640,00:35:47.760,她哭着来求朕,00:35:47.720,00:35:49.320,she came to me in tears
00:35:49.060,00:35:50.800,准她和你一同去,00:35:50.200,00:35:51.880,begging to go with you.
00:35:52.100,00:35:53.640,同甘容易共苦难,00:35:53.080,00:35:55.220,"Sharing weals is easy, sharing woes is rare."
00:35:54.810,00:35:58.150,雪中送炭之情难能可贵,00:35:56.000,00:35:58.740,"""Charcoal sent on a snowy day"" warms the heart."
00:35:58.740,00:36:00.350,安妹妹的确如皇上所说,00:35:59.600,00:36:01.840,"Lingrong is as faithful as your Majesty says,"
00:36:01.320,00:36:03.860,但臣妾不敢把真相告知,00:36:02.220,00:36:04.760,but I dare not tell her the truth.
00:36:04.660,00:36:06.240,少一人知道总是好的,00:36:05.760,00:36:07.820,It’s better for one less person to know.
00:36:08.660,00:36:09.740,皇上可还好吗,00:36:09.720,00:36:11.400,Is your Majesty well?
00:36:11.460,00:36:12.450,自你回宫,00:36:12.420,00:36:13.800,"Since your return,"
00:36:13.170,00:36:14.830,这话你就问了好多次了,00:36:14.020,00:36:16.160,you have asked me that quite a few times.
00:36:16.000,00:36:18.960,是吗 臣妾自己也不知道,00:36:16.940,00:36:18.080,Really …
,,,00:36:18.440,00:36:20.020,I did not notice.
00:36:19.880,00:36:23.290,没事 如今一切都已经过去了,00:36:20.720,00:36:21.940,"No matter,"
,,,00:36:22.700,00:36:24.420,everything is over now.
00:36:24.890,00:36:25.670,都过去了,00:36:25.780,00:36:27.160,It’s all over?
00:36:30.060,00:36:33.300,敦亲王允饿囚禁宗人府,00:36:31.000,00:36:34.300,"State Prince Dun and Yun-e are
imprisoned in the Imperial Clan Court."
00:36:34.770,00:36:36.810,允禩更名阿其那,00:36:35.600,00:36:37.640,Yunsi has been renamed Akina;
00:36:37.520,00:36:39.110,允禟更名塞斯黑,00:36:38.440,00:36:40.180,Yun Tang is renamed Seche.
00:36:39.820,00:36:41.930,阿其那 塞斯黑,00:36:40.580,00:36:42.820,"Akina, Seche?"
00:36:42.950,00:36:45.900,这是咱们满语 意思是猪狗,00:36:43.980,00:36:46.940,"They mean ""dog"" and ""pig"" in Manchu."
00:36:47.530,00:36:49.320,这些人谋逆犯上,00:36:48.480,00:36:50.540,These men committed treason.
00:36:50.200,00:36:51.570,给他们起名猪狗,00:36:51.060,00:36:52.780,"Naming them ""Pig"" and ""Dog"""
00:36:52.120,00:36:53.410,也是侮辱了猪狗,00:36:52.940,00:36:54.620,insults actual pigs and dogs.
00:36:55.210,00:36:56.870,皇上一举拿下敦亲王,00:36:56.080,00:36:58.080,Your Majesty took down State Prince Dun swiftly.
00:36:57.340,00:36:59.670,果真是天助皇上一切顺利,00:36:58.280,00:37:00.840,"It’s a blessing from Heaven
that everything went smoothly."
00:37:01.510,00:37:03.120,朕还想告诉你一件事,00:37:02.380,00:37:04.380,I want to tell you one more thing.
00:37:04.680,00:37:06.710,敦亲王意图不轨之前,00:37:05.640,00:37:08.000,"Before State Prince Dun acted on his ill intention,"
00:37:07.300,00:37:10.010,曾想向年羹尧借兵,00:37:08.120,00:37:11.160,he had planned to borrow forces from Nian Gengyao.
00:37:11.020,00:37:14.300,这封密函被果郡王拦截了下来,00:37:11.960,00:37:15.240,A secret letter was intercepted by Noble Prince Guo.
00:37:14.770,00:37:16.050,那年羹尧接到密函,,,
00:37:16.400,00:37:17.480,会如何处置呢,00:37:15.660,00:37:17.220,"If Nian Gengyao had received that message,"
00:37:18.230,00:37:19.060,朕不知道,00:37:17.300,00:37:19.000,what would he have done?
,,,00:37:19.200,00:37:20.520,I am not sure.
00:37:20.530,00:37:23.810,臣妾想 他不至于真敢谋反,00:37:21.520,00:37:22.780,I believe ...
00:37:24.780,00:37:26.240,他舍不得眼前的荣禄,00:37:23.380,00:37:25.280,he won’t really dare to rebel
00:37:27.200,00:37:28.110,若真要冒险,00:37:25.760,00:37:27.680,for the sake of his current wealth and honor.
,,,00:37:28.160,00:37:29.640,"If he were to take the risk,"
00:37:28.620,00:37:31.070,他所得之物也不会比现在更多,00:37:29.640,00:37:32.280,"he would not obtain more
than what he already possesses."
00:37:31.790,00:37:34.900,年羹尧对朕已有怨慰之言,00:37:32.580,00:37:35.800,"Nian Gengyao has already spoken
words of resentment against me."
00:37:35.830,00:37:37.410,但年羹尧会顾忌华妃,,,
00:37:37.830,00:37:41.330,所以不敢妄动 但臣妾好奇,00:37:36.800,00:37:39.680,"But his actions would be impeded
by his concern for Consort Fleur."
,,,00:37:41.120,00:37:42.540,But I wonder
00:37:42.170,00:37:45.410,敦亲王为何会找上年羹尧,00:37:43.120,00:37:46.300,"why State Prince Dun contacted
Nian Gengyao in particular,"
00:37:45.760,00:37:46.710,而不找别人呢,00:37:46.660,00:37:48.120,and not others?
00:37:51.350,00:37:52.300,朕再想想,00:37:52.260,00:37:53.760,I will give it some thought.
00:37:55.980,00:37:57.510,别人怎么样朕不管,00:37:56.860,00:37:58.660,I don’t care about the others.
00:37:59.020,00:38:02.730,朕只知道 你为了和朕演这场戏,00:37:59.920,00:38:03.640,"I only know, in order to put on this act with me,"
00:38:03.070,00:38:04.350,实在是受委屈了,00:38:03.900,00:38:05.680,you have been through enough.
00:38:05.320,00:38:06.900,其实朕不一定,00:38:06.400,00:38:07.460,"In fact,"
00:38:07.280,00:38:08.900,非要打发你去蓬莱洲,00:38:07.820,00:38:10.200,I did not have to exile you to Penglai Island.
00:38:09.870,00:38:11.860,只是怕万一有什么不测,00:38:10.900,00:38:13.080,"I was just afraid that if anything went amiss,"
00:38:12.410,00:38:13.200,会伤着你,00:38:13.400,00:38:14.680,you would be hurt.
00:38:14.120,00:38:16.280,再者 你不在,00:38:15.140,00:38:16.160,"Besides,"
,,,00:38:16.560,00:38:17.840,your absence
00:38:16.960,00:38:20.070,年羹尧和华妃就不会那么警惕,00:38:18.000,00:38:21.060,lowered Nian Gengyao and Consort Nian’s vigilance.
00:38:20.750,00:38:21.620,臣妾明白,00:38:21.640,00:38:22.840,I understand.
00:38:22.880,00:38:24.540,本是为了大清和皇上,00:38:23.860,00:38:25.840,"For the welfare of the state and Your Majesty,"
00:38:25.300,00:38:27.210,臣妾受些委屈不算什么,00:38:26.220,00:38:28.460,such hardship does not matter to me.
00:38:29.930,00:38:32.390,知朕者嬛嬛也,00:38:30.900,00:38:33.360,"Huan Huan, you truly understand me."
00:38:39.190,00:38:40.770,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:38:40.140,00:38:42.140,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:38:41.820,00:38:44.060,要问安明天早点来就是了,00:38:42.600,00:38:45.220,Come early tomorrow if you wish to pay your respects.
00:38:44.900,00:38:46.060,你刚刚回宫,,,
00:38:46.400,00:38:48.190,这么晚还过来 不累吗,00:38:45.960,00:38:47.320,You have just returned.
00:38:48.780,00:38:50.360,臣妾一心感激娘娘,00:38:47.360,00:38:49.420,"Coming at such a late hour, aren’t you tired?"
00:38:50.660,00:38:52.110,若不连夜过来请安,00:38:49.720,00:38:51.440,I am full of gratitude towards your Majesty.
00:38:52.410,00:38:53.320,于心不安哪,00:38:51.600,00:38:53.260,"If I didn’t come to greet your Majesty tonight,"
00:38:53.870,00:38:54.730,起来吧,00:38:53.380,00:38:54.700,I would feel ill at ease.
00:38:54.990,00:38:55.820,多谢娘娘,00:38:54.800,00:38:55.900,You may rise.
00:38:58.160,00:38:59.450,这回来的路上,00:38:55.940,00:38:57.300,I thank Your Majesty.
00:38:59.750,00:39:01.660,没有跟莞嫔抱怨什么吧,00:38:58.640,00:39:02.440,"You did not complain of anything to
Concubine Sourire on your way back, did you?"
00:39:02.340,00:39:04.500,没有 臣妾谨守本分,,,
00:39:04.800,00:39:05.630,不敢多言,00:39:03.260,00:39:06.480,"No, I did not. I kept to my place
and spoke only when necessary."
00:39:05.920,00:39:08.910,那就好 皇上吩咐莞嫔的事,00:39:06.880,00:39:08.080,Very well.
00:39:09.180,00:39:10.670,她不敢轻易与你说,00:39:08.300,00:39:11.360,"Concubine Sourire could not tell you
what His Majesty had ordered"
00:39:10.890,00:39:13.500,你若抱怨莞嫔传到皇上耳朵里,00:39:11.680,00:39:14.440,"If you had complained and
your words had reached His Majesty,"
00:39:13.890,00:39:15.090,只会怪你不懂事,00:39:14.600,00:39:15.960,"he would have seen you as an insensible person,"
00:39:15.520,00:39:17.680,皇上会称赞她守口如瓶,00:39:16.360,00:39:18.820,"but praised her devotion to
keeping confidential information."
00:39:18.310,00:39:19.770,倒不如你不闻不问,00:39:19.240,00:39:20.800,"If you are acquiescent,"
00:39:20.020,00:39:22.560,皇上反而会觉得你很懂事,00:39:20.880,00:39:23.520,His Majesty will think highly of you.
00:39:24.070,00:39:26.680,本来皇上就很赞许你此次,00:39:25.100,00:39:27.240,His Majesty had high praise
00:39:26.990,00:39:29.020,跟莞嫔去蓬莱洲的义举了,00:39:27.440,00:39:29.940,for your righteous act to accompany Concubine Sourire.
00:39:30.240,00:39:32.270,臣妾原本还在犹豫,00:39:31.160,00:39:33.180,I originally hesitated.
00:39:32.570,00:39:33.650,若非娘娘指点,,,
00:39:33.990,00:39:35.730,还不敢抛下一切前往呢,00:39:33.440,00:39:36.740,"Without Your Majesty's enlightenment,
I would have gone with reservations."
00:39:37.330,00:39:38.610,莞嫔太聪慧,00:39:38.120,00:39:39.860,Concubine Sourire is too intelligent.
00:39:39.330,00:39:40.910,非要你显得笨笨的,00:39:40.240,00:39:41.860,You must show your relative dullness
00:39:41.210,00:39:42.870,她的聪慧才显眼,00:39:41.980,00:39:43.680,to accentuate her intelligence.
00:39:43.330,00:39:44.410,臣妾虽不明白,,,
00:39:44.750,00:39:45.910,但一定听娘娘的,00:39:44.240,00:39:45.580,"Although I don’t fully understand,"
00:39:46.500,00:39:48.210,皇上的事现在同本宫,00:39:45.640,00:39:47.180,I will always obey Your Majesty.
00:39:48.550,00:39:49.710,说得越来越少,00:39:47.480,00:39:50.480,"His Majesty now speaks to me less
and less about his concerns."
00:39:50.170,00:39:52.210,本宫不能不打听着,00:39:51.140,00:39:53.180,"I have to stay informed,"
00:39:52.930,00:39:55.040,否则莞嫔占尽先机,00:39:53.840,00:39:56.220,or else Concubine Sourire will always be a step ahead
00:39:55.390,00:39:57.970,难保不会是第二个华妃,00:39:56.280,00:39:58.920,and she might become the second Consort Fleur.
00:39:58.680,00:40:00.720,甄嬛应该不会吧,00:39:59.680,00:40:01.580,I doubt if Zhen Huan will be.
00:40:01.190,00:40:02.390,她也没这个本事,00:40:02.020,00:40:03.560,She is not capable of that.
00:40:02.690,00:40:05.050,得皇上如此宠爱就是本事,00:40:03.720,00:40:06.180,His Majesty's favor demonstrates her capabilities.
00:40:05.730,00:40:09.220,人心难测 留个心眼总不会错,00:40:06.740,00:40:10.240,"But her mind is unknown.
It’s better to err on the side of caution."
00:40:09.940,00:40:13.230,臣妾受教 此次敦亲王出事,00:40:10.880,00:40:12.700,I learned a lot from Your Majesty.
00:40:13.660,00:40:15.320,也给年羹尧打击不少,00:40:12.840,00:40:14.520,State Prince Dun’s downfall
00:40:15.830,00:40:16.660,华妃那边,00:40:14.660,00:40:16.500,was a blow to Nian Gengyao as well.
,,,00:40:16.800,00:40:17.940,And Consort Fleur ...
00:40:17.040,00:40:19.070,娘娘至少可以松口气了,00:40:18.060,00:40:20.080,Your Majesty can at least put your mind at ease for now.
00:40:19.330,00:40:21.660,松口气 还早呢,00:40:20.080,00:40:21.240,Can I?
,,,00:40:21.580,00:40:23.040,It’s still too early.
00:40:25.540,00:40:28.380,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:40:26.640,00:40:29.480,Peace and grace to Your Majesty
00:40:28.630,00:40:29.460,都起来吧,,,
00:40:29.710,00:40:31.200,谢皇后娘娘,00:40:29.600,00:40:30.640,You may rise.
,,,00:40:30.640,00:40:32.460,I thank Your Majesty
00:40:33.010,00:40:35.840,臣妾身子不安 先行告退了,00:40:33.840,00:40:36.780,I am not feeling well. I will take my leave now.
00:40:36.140,00:40:38.750,无妨 本来今天也没事,00:40:37.120,00:40:39.740,That is fine. There is nothing urgent today.
00:40:39.100,00:40:40.590,大家就回去歇着吧,00:40:40.180,00:40:41.900,You may all go back to your palaces.
00:40:41.230,00:40:43.510,只是莞嫔你先留下,00:40:42.220,00:40:44.600,"Concubine Sourire, you will stay."
00:40:49.190,00:40:50.810,臣妾告退,00:40:50.160,00:40:52.180,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:40:58.740,00:40:59.700,先坐下吧,,,
00:41:00.370,00:41:01.080,谢娘娘,00:40:59.620,00:41:00.920,Please sit.
00:41:05.420,00:41:06.370,你辛苦了,00:41:01.160,00:41:02.360,I thank Your Majesty.
00:41:07.420,00:41:09.530,皇后娘娘陪伴在皇上身边照料,00:41:06.220,00:41:07.860,You’ve endured much.
00:41:09.840,00:41:10.580,更是辛苦,00:41:08.240,00:41:11.380,"Your Majesty has endured more
serving alongside His Majesty."
00:41:10.880,00:41:11.960,臣妾多谢娘娘,00:41:11.620,00:41:12.940,I thank Your Majesty.
00:41:12.170,00:41:14.920,本宫同你都是为皇上分忧的,00:41:13.060,00:41:16.100,You and I both share His Majesty’s burdens.
00:41:15.550,00:41:17.420,怎能不尽心尽力呢,00:41:16.560,00:41:18.340,We need to give our utmost.
00:41:17.760,00:41:21.000,今日华妃她的地位迟早不保,00:41:18.700,00:41:21.900,"Consort Fleur may not keep her status
under the current circumstances."
00:41:21.220,00:41:23.640,她身边的人怕是也要受牵连,00:41:22.200,00:41:24.700,Those close to her may be affected as well.
00:41:24.100,00:41:25.890,再除去死了疯了的,00:41:24.980,00:41:26.860,"Disregarding the dead and the deranged,"
00:41:26.150,00:41:28.640,宫中的妃嫔已不多了,00:41:27.060,00:41:29.600,there are not many concubines left in the harem.
00:41:29.230,00:41:31.720,娘娘是要为皇上选秀吗,00:41:30.100,00:41:32.740,"Does Your Majesty intend to hold
another round of selections?"
00:41:32.070,00:41:33.430,皇上不愿选秀,00:41:33.220,00:41:34.640,His Majesty is unwilling.
00:41:34.150,00:41:36.270,太后和本宫的意思是,00:41:35.160,00:41:37.680,But the Empress Dowager and I have observed that
00:41:37.490,00:41:39.820,此次平息敦亲王之事,,,
00:41:40.200,00:41:41.660,有不少有功之臣,00:41:38.260,00:41:43.220,"many honorable officials contributed to suppressing
the rebellion of State Prince Dun."
00:41:44.410,00:41:45.750,若是这些功臣之家,,,
00:41:46.170,00:41:48.120,有适龄的女子可以选入宫中,00:41:45.340,00:41:46.980,"From these meritorious families,"
00:41:48.580,00:41:49.660,那是最好不过了,00:41:47.060,00:41:50.860,"it would be desirable to select women
of the right age to enter into the harem."
00:41:50.500,00:41:53.250,相信必定是大家闺秀 举止端庄,00:41:51.340,00:41:54.360,"Women from such respectable families
 will be educated and well-mannered."
00:41:53.630,00:41:55.920,原来皇上 本宫同莞嫔,00:41:54.640,00:41:56.940,"It seems that His Majesty, me, and you"
00:41:56.300,00:41:57.920,都想到一处去了,00:41:57.240,00:41:59.160,are thinking along the same lines.
00:41:58.640,00:42:00.800,那本宫就择一个好日子,00:41:59.620,00:42:01.700,Then I will decide on a good date
00:42:01.060,00:42:02.220,选取入宫吧,00:42:01.880,00:42:03.520,to welcome them into the palace.
00:42:02.600,00:42:04.340,皇后娘娘是后宫之主,00:42:03.640,00:42:05.480,Your Majesty is the distinguished head of the harem.
00:42:04.600,00:42:05.760,娘娘拿主意就是,00:42:05.560,00:42:07.020,We will obey Your Majesty's decision.
00:42:07.190,00:42:08.550,不过话说回来,00:42:08.160,00:42:09.520,"Speaking of family,"
00:42:08.860,00:42:11.640,你也是出身功臣之家的女子啊,00:42:09.740,00:42:12.480,you are also from a meritorious family.
00:42:12.320,00:42:15.430,娘娘言重了 臣妾不敢居功,00:42:13.280,00:42:14.660,Your Majesty praises me too highly.
00:42:15.700,00:42:16.610,有没有功劳,00:42:14.700,00:42:16.380,I dare not take any credit.
00:42:16.900,00:42:19.190,皇上同本宫心里都有数,00:42:16.500,00:42:18.500,His Majesty and I are well aware
,,,00:42:18.540,00:42:20.400,of the contribution you have made.
