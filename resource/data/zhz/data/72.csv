00:02:26.600,00:02:29.430,那些贱奴才是怎么说的,00:02:25.900,00:02:28.730,What did those vile lackeys say?
00:02:29.900,00:02:30.680,都已经招了,00:02:28.933,00:02:30.419,A full confession was obtained.
00:02:31.860,00:02:33.890,除了招供谋害熹贵妃的事,00:02:30.804,00:02:33.190,"Besides plotting to murder Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:02:34.570,00:02:36.020,还吐了不少东西出来,00:02:33.190,00:02:35.320,much more was choked out of them.
00:02:36.900,00:02:37.640,还有,00:02:35.755,00:02:36.940,Even more?
00:02:39.070,00:02:41.610,其他都不是什么大事,00:02:37.925,00:02:40.910,"The other matters are trifling,"
00:02:42.530,00:02:43.570,但只有一件,00:02:41.830,00:02:45.484,except for one that I dare not hold back from Your Majesty.
00:02:44.370,00:02:45.730,奴才不敢不来禀报,,,
00:02:47.040,00:02:47.780,什么事啊,00:02:46.340,00:02:47.703,What is it?
00:02:51.120,00:02:51.700,皇上,00:02:50.420,00:02:51.302,"Your Majesty,"
00:02:53.210,00:02:54.700,纯元皇后的死因,00:02:51.798,00:02:54.447,the death of Empress Première...
00:02:57.460,00:02:59.500,与 与皇后有关,00:02:56.640,00:02:58.800,was... was connected to the Empress.
00:03:01.050,00:03:01.790,大胆,00:03:00.350,00:03:01.731,How dare you!
00:03:03.220,00:03:03.880,奴才不敢,00:03:02.520,00:03:04.198,I dare not lie to Your Majesty.
00:03:15.150,00:03:17.730,你说一五一十地说,00:03:14.450,00:03:17.030,Speak. Don't spare a single detail!
00:03:18.440,00:03:18.980,是,00:03:17.740,00:03:18.657,Yes.
00:03:19.990,00:03:22.600,皇上 奴才问过太医,00:03:19.140,00:03:22.519,"Your Majesty, two foods were added to Empress Premier's meals."
00:03:23.120,00:03:24.280,说芭蕉性寒,,,
00:03:24.950,00:03:26.910,平时少吃些倒还无妨,00:03:22.774,00:03:26.382,"According to the Imperial doctors,
hardy banana is harmless to eat in small amounts;"
00:03:27.330,00:03:28.410,只是有孕的女子,00:03:26.630,00:03:29.467,"however, pregnant women must not touch it due to its cold nature."
00:03:28.580,00:03:30.320,千万不可轻易碰食,,,
00:03:31.250,00:03:34.660,只因芭蕉与桃仁 红花等药一样,00:03:30.550,00:03:33.920,"Hardy banana has a downward draining effect,"
00:03:35.130,00:03:36.740,有破淤除肿之效,00:03:34.000,00:03:36.390,similar to peach kernel and safflower seed.
00:03:37.090,00:03:39.700,其药性虽不像红花那般明显,00:03:36.390,00:03:39.470,"Its medicinal efficacy is not as strong as safflower,"
00:03:40.170,00:03:41.660,但是蒸食的话,,,
00:03:42.010,00:03:45.500,其药力会缓缓地渗入食物当中,00:03:39.470,00:03:45.038,"but when the fruit is cooked, the effect does seep into the food."
00:03:46.100,00:03:47.960,长久就会伤身哪,00:03:45.400,00:03:47.770,Over time it will harm the body.
00:03:48.470,00:03:50.810,另外 杏仁茶里面的杏仁,00:03:47.770,00:03:49.810,"Additionally, the almonds in her almond tea"
00:03:50.980,00:03:53.060,也被换做了会伤胎的桃仁,00:03:49.810,00:03:52.360,"were replaced by peach kernels, which could harm the pregnancy."
00:03:53.770,00:03:56.430,只因掺在其中 味道难以辨识,00:03:52.580,00:03:55.730,"Mixed in the tea, the taste is indistinguishable."
00:03:57.440,00:03:58.600,而这些东西,,,
00:03:59.740,00:04:03.150,一直都掺在纯元皇后的饮食中,00:03:56.740,00:04:03.000,"These two substances were added
to Empress Première's food all along."
00:04:05.620,00:04:07.570,是那些奴才亲口说的吗,00:04:04.920,00:04:07.172,Did this come from the mouths of those servants?
00:04:08.080,00:04:10.280,剪秋受尽了酷刑 什么也没招,00:04:07.380,00:04:09.760,"Autumn was subjected to every cruel torture,
but didn't reveal anything."
00:04:11.250,00:04:12.410,倒是那江福海,00:04:10.550,00:04:11.710,But Jiang Fuhai
00:04:13.830,00:04:15.040,招了个干干净净,00:04:12.904,00:04:14.340,confessed everything.
00:04:16.420,00:04:19.750,此外 纯元皇后所产下的死胎,00:04:15.720,00:04:19.050,"Besides that, the black and blue bruises on the body"
00:04:20.010,00:04:22.710,身带紫青瘢痕 也是铁证啊,00:04:19.050,00:04:22.053,of Empress Première's stillborn child provide ironclad proof.
00:04:23.630,00:04:26.720,不是因为从前那个侧福晋,00:04:22.930,00:04:26.020,Wasn't the stillbirth because the other Lord Consort
00:04:27.350,00:04:29.710,惹得纯元惊悸忧思的缘故吗,00:04:26.311,00:04:29.010,caused the Empress Première anxiety and fear?
00:04:30.140,00:04:32.430,太医说 正因如此,00:04:29.440,00:04:31.944,The imperial doctor said that explanation
00:04:33.440,00:04:36.180,所以这些诡计才被掩饰了过去,00:04:32.740,00:04:35.480,easily concealed the real plot.
00:05:01.300,00:05:02.130,果真是她,00:05:00.600,00:05:01.865,So it was really her.
00:05:02.800,00:05:04.660,是啊 皇上,00:05:02.100,00:05:03.960,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:05:05.630,00:05:07.220,除了谋害纯元皇后之外,00:05:04.930,00:05:06.520,"Besides this plot against Empress Première,"
00:05:08.180,00:05:09.540,还有很多呀,00:05:07.480,00:05:08.953,there are many others.
00:05:11.720,00:05:12.550,朕以为,00:05:11.020,00:05:12.152,I always thought
00:05:14.230,00:05:16.140,她与纯元是亲姐妹,00:05:13.530,00:05:15.440,Première was her dear sister.
00:05:17.770,00:05:18.730,她待纯元,00:05:17.070,00:05:18.427,She attended Première
00:05:19.820,00:05:22.310,既恭谨 又谦和,00:05:19.120,00:05:21.610,with humility and deference.
00:05:30.080,00:05:30.690,带她来,00:05:29.380,00:05:30.292,Bring her here.
00:05:32.200,00:05:33.820,我与她多年夫妻,00:05:31.500,00:05:33.291,We have been husband and wife for many years.
00:05:35.250,00:05:35.990,朕相信,00:05:34.550,00:05:35.869,I believe she plotted
00:05:38.460,00:05:39.700,她筹谋储君,00:05:37.253,00:05:39.760,to influence the selection of Crown Prince.
00:05:40.460,00:05:41.320,朕也相信,00:05:39.760,00:05:40.959,I can also believe
00:05:42.300,00:05:46.760,她戕害嫔妃 残害皇嗣,00:05:41.511,00:05:46.200,she harmed the concubines and the imperial heirs.
00:05:48.340,00:05:49.500,可是纯元的事,00:05:47.150,00:05:48.960,But this matter of Première  -
00:05:50.680,00:05:52.140,朕要亲口听她说,00:05:49.446,00:05:51.629,I need to hear from her own lips.
00:05:53.810,00:05:54.390,嗻,00:05:52.695,00:05:53.652,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:05:59.350,00:06:00.640,已经到了这地步,00:05:58.650,00:06:00.919,"Now that it's come to this,"
00:06:02.820,00:06:03.900,你可认罪吗,00:06:01.897,00:06:03.512,will you admit your crimes?
00:06:06.110,00:06:07.850,皇上既然已经相信,00:06:04.965,00:06:07.256,Your Majesty already believes it.
00:06:08.490,00:06:10.230,何必再来问臣妾呢,00:06:07.595,00:06:09.530,Why do you need to ask me?
00:06:10.820,00:06:14.070,若非等你亲口认罪,00:06:10.000,00:06:13.606,"If not to hear you confess to your crimes,"
00:06:15.500,00:06:17.110,你以为朕还愿意,00:06:14.221,00:06:18.167,do you think I could tolerate seeing your face?
00:06:17.370,00:06:18.660,再见到你这张脸,,,
00:06:20.920,00:06:22.910,臣妾已经年老色衰了,00:06:20.220,00:06:22.436,I've grown old and my beauty has faded.
00:06:24.050,00:06:26.210,皇上自然会嫌恶,00:06:23.199,00:06:25.510,Of course Your Majesty is averse to seeing me.
00:06:27.970,00:06:29.300,臣妾只是想,00:06:27.081,00:06:28.771,It makes me wonder:
00:06:30.140,00:06:31.500,若姐姐还在,00:06:29.440,00:06:30.971,"if my sister were still alive,"
00:06:32.470,00:06:34.340,皇上是否还真心,00:06:31.581,00:06:36.320,would Your Majesty still wholeheartedly love her aging face ?
00:06:34.680,00:06:37.050,喜爱她逐渐老去的容颜,,,
00:06:38.480,00:06:40.220,臣妾真是后悔呀,00:06:37.478,00:06:39.520,Now I am filled with regret.
00:06:41.520,00:06:44.600,应该让皇上见到姐姐,00:06:40.820,00:06:43.900,I should have let Your Majesty watch
,,,00:06:44.209,00:06:45.609,"her beauty decay,"
00:06:45.110,00:06:48.440,如今与臣妾一样衰败的容貌,00:06:46.051,00:06:47.433,like mine.
00:06:49.450,00:06:53.230,皇上或许就不会这么恨臣妾了,00:06:48.599,00:06:52.379,Maybe Your Majesty wouldn't hate me so much then.
00:06:53.740,00:06:55.320,心慈则貌美,00:06:53.040,00:06:54.749,Beauty comes from a kind heart.
00:06:56.450,00:06:58.570,纯元纵然年华老去,00:06:55.750,00:06:57.870,"Even if Première had grown old,"
00:06:59.500,00:07:01.450,也一定会胜过你万千,00:06:58.649,00:07:00.960,she would be worth ten thousand of you.
00:07:08.050,00:07:12.340,这对玉镯还是臣妾入府的时候,00:07:07.161,00:07:11.451,Your Majesty put this pair of bracelets on my wrists
00:07:13.350,00:07:15.590,皇上亲自为臣妾戴上的,00:07:12.650,00:07:14.890,when we were first married.
00:07:16.560,00:07:19.840,愿如此环 朝夕相见,00:07:15.860,00:07:19.140,"""I hope we see each other day and night like these bracelets."""
00:07:21.190,00:07:25.180,可如今皇上以为臣妾犯错,00:07:20.490,00:07:24.480,"Now Your Majesty believes that I've done wrong,"
00:07:25.440,00:07:27.430,大约不愿意再见臣妾了吧,00:07:24.740,00:07:26.730,and perhaps doesn't wish to see me anymore.
00:07:28.610,00:07:29.350,当年,00:07:27.910,00:07:28.839,"At that time,"
00:07:30.320,00:07:33.810,皇上同样执着此环同臣妾说,00:07:29.620,00:07:33.110,"with these bracelets in hand, Your Majesty told me"
00:07:35.200,00:07:36.570,若生下皇子,00:07:34.500,00:07:36.059,"that if I gave birth to a son,"
00:07:37.450,00:07:40.540,福晋便是臣妾的,00:07:36.750,00:07:39.840,you would make me your primary wife.
00:07:42.210,00:07:44.240,可臣妾生下皇子时,00:07:41.510,00:07:43.540,"But when my son was born,"
00:07:45.380,00:07:47.710,皇上已经娶了姐姐为福晋,00:07:44.680,00:07:47.360,you had already married my sister as your primary wife.
00:07:49.630,00:07:53.250,连臣妾的孩子也要被迫成为庶子,00:07:48.930,00:07:52.550,"My child would only be the son of a secondary wife,"
00:07:54.140,00:07:55.120,和臣妾一样,00:07:53.440,00:07:54.420,"just like I am,"
00:07:56.010,00:07:58.380,永远摆脱不了庶出的身份,00:07:54.868,00:07:57.238,and could never be rid of this mark.
00:07:59.850,00:08:02.180,你知道朕并不在意嫡庶,00:07:59.150,00:08:01.706,You know I never cared about the primacy status.
00:08:03.690,00:08:04.930,皇额娘也不在意,00:08:02.990,00:08:04.655,Neither did Imperial Mother care.
00:08:05.940,00:08:07.930,皇额娘是庶出,00:08:05.240,00:08:07.230,Imperial Mother was born of a secondary wife.
00:08:08.730,00:08:10.270,朕也是庶出,00:08:08.030,00:08:09.796,Even I was born of a secondary wife.
00:08:10.940,00:08:12.400,皇上 你可曾知道,00:08:10.240,00:08:12.000,"Your Majesty, how could you ever know"
00:08:13.200,00:08:15.810,庶出的女子有多痛苦啊,00:08:12.500,00:08:15.239,how painful life is for the daughter of a secondary wife?
00:08:17.530,00:08:19.450,嫡庶尊卑分明,00:08:16.669,00:08:18.836,Our mother's standing dictates our lifelong status.
00:08:21.000,00:08:25.080,臣妾与臣妾的额娘很少受到重视,00:08:20.000,00:08:24.380,My mother and I were never highly regarded.
00:08:26.960,00:08:28.580,你何曾明白呀,00:08:26.260,00:08:27.880,Did you ever understand?
00:08:29.000,00:08:29.740,朕明白,00:08:28.300,00:08:29.379,I did understand.
00:08:30.670,00:08:31.830,正因为朕明白,00:08:29.970,00:08:31.130,That was exactly why
00:08:33.430,00:08:35.960,所以才在你入府以后厚待于你,00:08:32.730,00:08:35.260,I treated you generously after you entered my estate.
00:08:36.640,00:08:39.090,即便朕立了纯元为唯一的福晋,00:08:35.940,00:08:38.390,"Even though I made Première my primary wife,"
00:08:39.510,00:08:41.220,你也是仅次于她的侧福晋,00:08:38.810,00:08:40.800,you were second only to her.
00:08:42.060,00:08:43.260,可是你永不知足,00:08:41.360,00:08:43.028,But you were never content!
00:08:43.940,00:08:45.890,本该属于臣妾的福晋之位,00:08:43.240,00:08:45.190,The title of primary wife should have been mine;
00:08:46.150,00:08:47.390,被他人一朝夺去,00:08:45.450,00:08:46.879,it was handed to her!
00:08:48.440,00:08:50.930,本该属于臣妾儿子的太子之位,00:08:47.740,00:08:50.230,My son's prospects to become Crown Prince
00:08:51.320,00:08:52.520,也要另属他人,00:08:50.620,00:08:52.122,were ground underfoot!
00:08:53.530,00:08:57.610,臣妾夫君所有的宠爱都给了她,00:08:52.830,00:08:56.910,All the love from my husband was given to her.
00:08:58.830,00:09:00.490,臣妾很想知足,00:08:58.130,00:08:59.790,"I wanted to be content,"
00:09:01.160,00:09:03.150,可是臣妾做不到啊,00:09:00.460,00:09:02.450,but I couldn't make myself!
00:09:03.460,00:09:05.410,纯元是你的亲姐姐,00:09:02.760,00:09:04.710,Première was your sister!
00:09:09.000,00:09:11.910,要你入府是朕错了,00:09:08.300,00:09:11.200,It was my mistake to have married you.
00:09:13.800,00:09:17.510,皇上错在不是迎臣妾入府,00:09:13.100,00:09:16.810,"Your Majesty's mistake wasn't marrying me into the estate,"
00:09:18.300,00:09:20.040,是不该迎姐姐入府,00:09:17.600,00:09:19.383,but marrying Première
00:09:21.060,00:09:22.470,专宠姐姐,00:09:20.360,00:09:21.856,and favoring her exclusively.
00:09:23.810,00:09:26.420,既生瑜 何生亮啊,00:09:23.110,00:09:25.934,"""Since Yu was already born, why was Liang ever born?"""
00:09:27.900,00:09:29.510,皇上何等睿智,00:09:27.200,00:09:28.810,"Your Majesty is wise,"
00:09:29.860,00:09:33.270,怎么到了自己身上就这样不明白,00:09:29.160,00:09:32.480,why couldn't you understand the pertinence of this saying.
00:09:34.280,00:09:37.640,是朕太看重你们的姐妹之情了,00:09:33.580,00:09:36.940,I overestimated the sisterhood between you.
00:09:38.360,00:09:39.440,你就不怕报应,00:09:37.660,00:09:39.040,Don't you fear Heaven's retribution?
00:09:40.490,00:09:41.610,午夜梦回的时候,00:09:39.601,00:09:41.136,"When you dream at night,"
00:09:42.080,00:09:43.740,你就不怕纯元和孩子,00:09:41.380,00:09:43.229,aren't you afraid that Première and her son
00:09:44.120,00:09:45.450,来向你追魂索命,00:09:43.420,00:09:45.050,"will come to you, demanding your life?"
00:09:45.750,00:09:47.990,她要来索命尽管来索呀,00:09:45.050,00:09:47.290,"If she wants my life, let her come!"
00:09:49.250,00:09:51.910,免得臣妾长夜漫漫,00:09:48.550,00:09:51.210,Better than me dreaming of my own child
00:09:52.420,00:09:55.710,总梦见我的孩子向我啼哭不已,00:09:51.720,00:09:55.010,"crying to me every long, endless night."
00:09:57.180,00:09:58.960,孩子夭亡的时候,00:09:56.480,00:09:58.260,"When my son died,"
00:09:59.340,00:10:00.800,姐姐有了身孕,00:09:58.640,00:10:00.100,she became pregnant.
00:10:02.060,00:10:04.760,皇上你只顾姐姐有孕之喜,00:10:01.360,00:10:04.249,Your Majesty was so engrossed in the joy of her pregnancy.
00:10:05.230,00:10:08.840,何曾还记得臣妾与你的孩子啊,00:10:04.530,00:10:08.140,Did you even remember the child I had with you?
00:10:10.690,00:10:11.930,他还不满三岁,00:10:09.990,00:10:11.585,"He was only three years old,"
00:10:13.070,00:10:15.520,高烧烧得浑身滚烫,00:10:12.370,00:10:14.820,burning up from high fever
00:10:16.400,00:10:18.640,不治而死啊,00:10:15.700,00:10:17.639,and no treatment could help him!
00:10:20.450,00:10:22.560,臣妾抱着他的尸身,00:10:19.750,00:10:21.860,I carried his dead body in my arms
00:10:23.080,00:10:25.570,在雨中走了一晚上,00:10:22.380,00:10:24.870,and walked in the rain all night.
00:10:26.830,00:10:30.950,想走到阎罗殿求满殿神佛,00:10:26.130,00:10:30.250,"I wanted to walk to the judge of the underworld
and beg all the Buddhas and gods:"
00:10:31.330,00:10:33.290,要索命就索我的命,00:10:30.630,00:10:32.590,"if they had to take one life,"
00:10:33.590,00:10:35.950,别索我儿子的命啊,00:10:32.890,00:10:35.250,take mine instead of my son's!
00:10:40.930,00:10:42.920,而姐姐这时竟然有了孩子,00:10:40.230,00:10:42.559,Première became pregnant at that very moment!
00:10:43.430,00:10:45.890,不是她的儿子索了我儿子的命吗,00:10:42.730,00:10:45.190,Wasn't it her son who took my son's life?!
00:10:46.180,00:10:47.640,我怎能容忍她的儿子,00:10:45.480,00:10:47.129,How could I bear to see her son
00:10:47.980,00:10:49.930,坐上太子之位呢,00:10:47.280,00:10:49.230,become the heir to the throne?
00:10:50.270,00:10:51.060,你疯了,00:10:49.570,00:10:50.775,You've lost your mind!
00:10:51.980,00:10:54.140,是朕执意要娶纯元,00:10:51.280,00:10:53.440,It was I who insisted on marrying Première.
00:10:54.690,00:10:56.930,是朕执意要立她为福晋,00:10:53.990,00:10:56.230,It was I who demanded to make her my primary wife.
00:10:57.440,00:10:58.900,是朕与她有了孩子,00:10:56.740,00:10:58.351,It was I who had a child with her.
00:10:59.240,00:11:00.350,你为什么不恨朕,00:10:58.540,00:11:00.000,Why didn't you hate me instead?
00:11:02.780,00:11:04.740,皇上以为臣妾不想吗,00:11:02.080,00:11:04.040,Your Majesty thinks I didn't want to?
00:11:07.580,00:11:09.660,臣妾多想恨你呀,00:11:06.880,00:11:08.960,How much I wished to hate you...
00:11:12.630,00:11:14.210,可是臣妾做不到,00:11:11.729,00:11:13.573,but I couldn't make myself!
00:11:15.300,00:11:17.790,臣妾做不到啊,00:11:14.319,00:11:16.809,I couldn't make myself!
00:11:18.840,00:11:21.210,皇上的眼中只有姐姐,00:11:17.939,00:11:20.510,Your Majesty had only Première in your eyes.
00:11:22.390,00:11:24.050,皇上你可曾知道,00:11:21.690,00:11:23.652,But has Your Majesty ever known that
00:11:24.890,00:11:26.500,臣妾对你的爱意,00:11:24.190,00:11:25.800,my love for you
00:11:26.850,00:11:28.960,不比你对姐姐的少啊,00:11:26.150,00:11:28.260,is no less than yours for her?
00:11:31.310,00:11:32.300,皇上,00:11:30.610,00:11:31.638,"Your Majesty,"
00:11:33.520,00:11:35.980,你以为姐姐爱你很多吗,00:11:32.820,00:11:35.280,do you think Première loved you so much?
00:11:37.730,00:11:41.320,你以为熹贵妃真的爱你吗,00:11:37.030,00:11:40.620,Do you think Noble Consort Lumière really loves you?
00:11:43.990,00:11:45.950,凡是深爱丈夫的女子,00:11:43.290,00:11:46.233,How can any woman who truly loves her husband
00:11:47.160,00:11:49.700,有谁愿意看着自己深爱的丈夫,00:11:46.233,00:11:52.519,"willingly allow herself to see her husband
loving other women and having children with them?"
00:11:50.080,00:11:53.040,与别的女人恩爱生子啊,,,
00:11:54.830,00:11:56.290,臣妾做不到,00:11:54.130,00:11:55.840,I couldn't make myself!
00:11:57.130,00:11:59.410,臣妾做不到啊,00:11:56.430,00:11:58.710,I couldn't make myself!
00:12:00.550,00:12:02.960,皇上虽然以为臣妾悍妒,00:11:59.649,00:12:02.059,"Your Majesty thinks I'm crazed with jealousy,"
00:12:03.890,00:12:08.050,可是臣妾是真真正正深爱着皇上,00:12:02.976,00:12:09.536,but it's because I am truly and deeply in love with you!
00:12:08.560,00:12:11.300,所以臣妾才会如此啊,,,
00:12:12.230,00:12:13.390,佛口蛇心,00:12:11.530,00:12:13.513,The words of a Buddha and the heart of a snake.

00:12:23.910,00:12:24.770,皇上,00:12:23.210,00:12:24.296,"Your Majesty,"
00:12:26.410,00:12:29.620,臣妾若不是身在皇后之位,00:12:25.710,00:12:30.919,"if I were not defending myself as the Empress,"
00:12:29.910,00:12:31.280,要保全自身,,,
00:12:32.660,00:12:35.250,也希望皇上心中,00:12:31.960,00:12:34.550,I would also wish that
00:12:35.460,00:12:37.540,还记得臣妾的一点好,00:12:34.760,00:12:37.331,"Your Majesty remember the goodness about me,
no matter how little."
00:12:39.000,00:12:42.540,臣妾何尝不愿意什么都不掩藏,00:12:38.300,00:12:41.840,How I wish I never had to conceal anything from Your Majesty.
00:12:44.010,00:12:46.250,臣妾不得已的贤惠,00:12:43.310,00:12:45.663,Practicing virtue so reluctantly
00:12:47.050,00:12:52.470,也是臣妾最痛心 最难过之处啊,00:12:46.350,00:12:51.770,became the greatest sorrow of my life.

00:19:09.350,00:19:12.720,这些年忙着改土归流,00:19:08.650,00:19:12.234,"These years I have been busy with land regulation,"

00:19:47.770,00:19:50.430,大军中暑病倒之人连连,00:19:47.070,00:19:51.520,Many soldiers are overcome by heat stroke and cannot fight.
00:19:50.770,00:19:51.720,难以应战,,,
00:19:53.060,00:19:55.270,眼下若再调良将,00:19:52.360,00:19:54.570,"At the moment, it will be difficult"
00:19:55.900,00:19:58.560,恐怕一时有些难,00:19:55.011,00:19:57.860,to deploy another good general.
00:19:59.030,00:20:02.060,千军易得 良将难求,00:19:58.330,00:20:01.360,"""Easier to gather thousands of soldiers
than to find one good general."""

00:20:21.880,00:20:22.960,咱们动不动就得罪,00:20:21.180,00:20:22.633,We are so quick to offend him.
00:20:23.590,00:20:25.130,真不知道怎么伺候啊,00:20:22.633,00:20:24.430,How should I serve him now?
00:20:26.010,00:20:27.420,没瞧见这两天的奏折,00:20:25.310,00:20:26.980,Haven't you seen those piles of memoranda?
00:20:27.680,00:20:29.220,堆得把皇上都埋进去了,00:20:26.980,00:20:28.714,His Majesty is almost buried in them.
00:20:30.020,00:20:30.970,怎么伺候,00:20:29.320,00:20:32.798,"How can you serve?
Pretend it is your head on the serving platter."
00:20:31.430,00:20:33.890,把自个儿脑袋拎在手心上伺候陨,,,
00:20:35.520,00:20:36.730,御前有师傅您呢,00:20:34.443,00:20:36.294,"Shifu, good thing you're directly serving His Majesty."
00:20:37.230,00:20:39.020,倒是永寿宫打发人来了两回,00:20:36.294,00:20:38.700,"By the way, the Palace of Eternal Longevity sent people here twice"
00:20:39.400,00:20:40.440,请皇上用膳呢,00:20:38.700,00:20:40.155,to invite His Majesty for dinner.
00:20:43.030,00:20:44.940,早膳皇上只用了一点,00:20:42.330,00:20:44.240,"His Majesty only had a few bites at breakfast,"
00:20:45.610,00:20:47.350,午膳几乎是没碰,00:20:44.910,00:20:46.650,and scarcely touched lunch.
00:20:47.780,00:20:49.190,全靠参汤吊着呢,00:20:47.080,00:20:48.704,His energy is hanging on the ginseng soup.
00:20:50.120,00:20:51.660,把眼睛都熬红了,00:20:49.081,00:20:50.960,His eyes are red and tired.
00:20:53.210,00:20:54.910,那皇上到底怎么了,00:20:52.510,00:20:54.296,What actually happened to His Majesty?
00:20:55.170,00:20:57.370,怎么了 问老天爷吧,00:20:54.470,00:20:56.670,What's happened? Ask Heaven.
00:20:59.130,00:21:00.620,那皇上的意思是,00:20:58.430,00:21:00.000,What is Your Majesty's opinion?
00:21:01.550,00:21:04.660,替朕上前线 最好是亲王,00:21:00.850,00:21:03.960,A state prince is the best choice to represent me on the battlefield.
00:21:06.220,00:21:07.460,朕思来想去,00:21:05.131,00:21:06.748,"After thinking it through,"
00:21:08.720,00:21:10.840,果郡王还算是上佳人选,00:21:08.020,00:21:10.140,Noble Prince Guo is the top choice.
00:21:11.430,00:21:13.970,果郡王生母出身不高,00:21:10.450,00:21:14.431,"His mother's humble background constrains
any inappropriate ambitions."
00:21:14.600,00:21:15.430,无甚威望,,,
00:21:16.150,00:21:17.260,他又一向安分,00:21:15.134,00:21:16.484,"Besides, he respects boundaries."
00:21:18.310,00:21:20.100,皇上思虑周详,00:21:17.168,00:21:19.400,Your Majesty is meticulous in your deliberation.
00:21:20.650,00:21:22.390,臣拜服,00:21:19.950,00:21:21.690,I revere Your Majesty's order.
00:21:22.860,00:21:23.940,他喜好诗书,00:21:21.946,00:21:23.360,He is into books and poetry.
00:21:24.860,00:21:28.100,朕封他个虚名也罢了,00:21:23.840,00:21:27.400,I will confer a title on him in name only.
00:21:29.620,00:21:31.860,至于战将 你可要调度好,00:21:28.920,00:21:31.160,"As for the generals, you must deploy wisely."
00:21:32.330,00:21:33.240,臣知道,00:21:31.390,00:21:32.540,I understand.
00:21:33.830,00:21:35.790,这件事要悄悄地做,00:21:33.130,00:21:35.261,Make sure it's done quietly.
00:21:37.330,00:21:40.080,先拨骁骑营两千军士给果郡王,00:21:36.373,00:21:39.380,"Allocate State Prince Guo two thousand men
from the Valiant Cavalry."
00:21:41.090,00:21:42.620,等前线战事稍稳,00:21:40.190,00:21:41.920,"Once the front line is more stable,"
00:21:44.010,00:21:46.500,就派他去雁鸣关替朕镇守,00:21:43.310,00:21:45.800,send him to guard the Yanming Pass.
00:21:48.140,00:21:48.670,嗻,00:21:47.159,00:21:47.689,Yes.
00:21:51.600,00:21:53.930,关上窗 朕不想听到风声,00:21:50.900,00:21:53.230,Close the windows. I don't want to hear the wind.
00:21:54.480,00:21:54.960,嗻,00:21:53.580,00:21:54.280,Yes.
00:21:58.020,00:21:59.760,雁鸣关虽已风声鹤唳,00:21:56.862,00:21:59.761,"At Yanming Pass ""the frightful wind resembles
as the roars of the enemy,"""
00:22:00.520,00:22:01.850,但皇上天纵英明,00:21:59.761,00:22:02.400,yet Your Majesty's divine wisdom can command the wind and rain.
00:22:02.480,00:22:03.600,自可呼风唤雨,,,
00:22:05.280,00:22:06.230,你看看这个,00:22:04.194,00:22:05.659,Have a look at this.
00:22:15.370,00:22:16.200,准葛尔要大清,00:22:14.113,00:22:17.643,"Dzungar asks the Great Qing
to award them three million taels a year."
00:22:16.500,00:22:18.450,每年封赏白银三百万两,,,
00:22:18.790,00:22:21.660,这个摩格是准葛尔的新可汗,00:22:17.720,00:22:20.960,This Galdan is the new Khagan of Dzungar.
00:22:22.290,00:22:24.710,年轻气盛 胃口很大,00:22:21.333,00:22:24.010,"He is young, and his appetite is too great."
00:22:25.880,00:22:26.620,他这么做,00:22:24.794,00:22:25.920,He asks this
00:22:27.220,00:22:29.080,一则是试探大清的虚实,00:22:26.134,00:22:28.380,to test the real strength of the Great Qing
00:22:29.680,00:22:32.540,二是想借此出兵夺地,00:22:28.980,00:22:34.026,and to drum up grounds for starting a war.
00:22:32.850,00:22:34.930,也好师出有名,00:22:34.566,00:22:36.649,Galdan aims to shake the Great Qing at its roots.
00:22:35.850,00:22:37.590,摩格意在动摇大清根基,00:22:37.230,00:22:38.640,Your Majesty must not approve.
00:22:38.230,00:22:39.340,皇上万不可答应,00:22:38.936,00:22:40.000,Of course I won't.
00:22:39.850,00:22:40.590,这是自然,,,
00:22:41.560,00:22:42.900,他敢这么肆无忌惮,00:22:40.646,00:22:42.200,He dares to be so reckless
00:22:43.610,00:22:46.600,还不是自恃兵强马壮 粮草充足,00:22:42.710,00:22:45.600,because he is confident in his troops and provisions.
00:22:47.490,00:22:48.900,朕不能小戏了他,00:22:46.533,00:22:48.200,I should not underestimate him.
00:22:52.280,00:22:55.030,皇上 张廷玉大人求见,00:22:51.580,00:22:54.330,"Your Majesty, Mr. Zhang Tingyu requests an audience."
00:22:56.330,00:22:56.860,嗻,00:22:55.470,00:22:56.160,Yes.
00:22:58.160,00:22:59.280,臣妾先告退了,00:22:56.960,00:22:58.580,"Your Majesty, I will take my leave."
00:23:10.340,00:23:11.460,给皇上请安,00:23:09.640,00:23:11.000,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:23:12.090,00:23:12.670,起来吧,00:23:11.160,00:23:11.941,You may rise.
00:23:15.760,00:23:16.420,皇上,00:23:14.698,00:23:15.558,"Your Majesty,"
00:23:17.180,00:23:19.220,岳钟麒将军连夜密报,00:23:16.239,00:23:18.365,General Yue Zhongqi sent messengers dashing overnight
00:23:19.600,00:23:22.180,说雁鸣关外的准葛尔军队,00:23:18.619,00:23:21.328,to report that a plague has been spreading
00:23:22.480,00:23:23.390,突发时疫,00:23:21.499,00:23:22.655,among the Dzungar troops.
00:23:26.940,00:23:28.230,天佑我大清,00:23:26.240,00:23:27.690,Heaven blesses our Great Qing.
00:23:28.860,00:23:31.150,今日 准葛尔派人觐见,00:23:28.160,00:23:30.450,"Today, Dzungar sent an envoy"
00:23:31.660,00:23:35.770,提出可汗摩格要上京拜见皇上,00:23:30.746,00:23:35.070,requesting an audience for Khagan Galdan with Your Majesty.
00:23:36.450,00:23:39.030,他此时上京又意在何为呢,00:23:35.750,00:23:38.330,What could be his intention in coming to Beijing now?
00:23:39.460,00:23:42.040,可汗摩格觊觎大清已久,00:23:38.519,00:23:41.099,Galdan has long coveted the Great Qing.
00:23:42.540,00:23:44.450,如今准葛尔虽发时疫,00:23:41.840,00:23:43.750,"Although they are stricken by the plague,"
00:23:44.670,00:23:46.660,但数十万大军粮草齐备,00:23:43.750,00:23:45.960,"they still have a few hundred thousand soldiers
and plentiful supplies."
00:23:47.500,00:23:50.000,皇上 我们不得不防,00:23:46.800,00:23:49.300,"Your Majesty, we must remain wary."
00:23:52.340,00:23:54.830,你派人去弄清楚准葛尔那边,00:23:51.340,00:23:54.130,Send someone there to find out
00:23:55.100,00:23:56.300,引起时疫的因由,00:23:54.130,00:23:55.600,the cause of the plague.
00:23:57.720,00:24:00.970,朕记得 当年曾经让温太医,00:23:57.020,00:24:00.270,I remember I ordered Dr. Wen
00:24:01.440,00:24:03.930,将医疗时疫的方子保留了下来,00:24:00.483,00:24:03.230,to keep the prescriptions for the plague.
00:24:04.860,00:24:06.060,或许能派上用场,00:24:03.817,00:24:05.480,It may be useful in the future.
00:24:08.190,00:24:08.770,嗻,00:24:07.319,00:24:08.070,Yes.
00:24:09.360,00:24:12.100,长姐 万不能让王爷去边关哪,00:24:08.660,00:24:11.400,"Elder sister, we cannot let His Lordship go to the front."
00:24:12.700,00:24:14.110,沙场刀枪无眼不说,00:24:12.000,00:24:13.750,"Setting aside the danger of blades and spears,"
00:24:14.450,00:24:16.360,皇上一直都忌惮着王爷的才华,00:24:13.750,00:24:15.740,His Majesty is wary due to His Lordship's great talent.
00:24:17.160,00:24:18.020,这军功上,00:24:16.140,00:24:17.320,"Regarding military prowess,"
00:24:19.080,00:24:20.690,敦亲王可是前车之鉴哪,00:24:17.920,00:24:20.290,the fate of State Prince Dun is the example we see.
00:24:21.790,00:24:23.650,皇上的性子你我不是不知道,00:24:20.919,00:24:22.950,We both know of His Majesty's temperament.
00:24:24.380,00:24:25.660,王爷是势在必行,00:24:23.320,00:24:25.280,His Lordship cannot swim against the tide.
00:24:27.340,00:24:29.040,可是一定要百般请辞,00:24:26.320,00:24:28.500,"If His Lordship insists on declining,"
00:24:29.630,00:24:31.170,那请辞的藉口只有一个,00:24:28.930,00:24:30.470,the only reason he can give is this:
00:24:32.050,00:24:33.160,便是自称无能,00:24:31.350,00:24:32.460,to call himself incompetent.
00:24:34.010,00:24:36.750,唯有如此 皇上才会稍稍放心,00:24:33.310,00:24:35.890,"Only this will ease His Majesty's mind,"
00:24:37.100,00:24:38.050,王爷才会安全,00:24:36.050,00:24:37.350,and keep His Lordship from suspicion.
00:24:38.600,00:24:39.800,王爷就不能不去吗,00:24:37.620,00:24:38.980,Does His Lordship have to go?
00:24:40.980,00:24:42.390,朝廷在用人之际,00:24:40.000,00:24:41.690,The court is in need of assistance.
00:24:42.940,00:24:44.520,皇上可用的亲王不多,00:24:42.240,00:24:43.980,There are not many State Princes that His Majesty can send.
00:24:46.310,00:24:48.300,难怪允禧在王府里气得发疯,00:24:45.410,00:24:47.600,No wonder Yunxi is madly restless at home.
00:24:48.820,00:24:51.230,国难当头 他自然急着效力沙场,00:24:48.120,00:24:50.530,"In this crisis, of course he wants to serve at the battlefield."
00:24:51.820,00:24:53.650,只是递了好几个折子,00:24:50.949,00:24:52.950,But none of his memorandums
00:24:54.280,00:24:55.940,皇上都没有半句回应,00:24:53.409,00:24:55.240,received a response from His Majesty.
00:24:56.820,00:24:58.030,慎贝勒还年轻,00:24:55.720,00:24:57.530,Venerable Prince Shen is still young.
00:24:58.620,00:25:00.450,自然有他建功立业的机会,00:24:57.706,00:24:59.750,There are plenty of opportunities ahead of him.
00:25:01.080,00:25:03.030,他是看十七哥得皇上看重,00:25:00.179,00:25:02.129,He is just upset to see his seventeenth brother given duties
00:25:03.410,00:25:05.120,怨自己白食俸禄罢了,00:25:02.539,00:25:04.420,while he himself receives stipends for doing nothing.
00:25:06.830,00:25:07.660,罢了 罢了,00:25:05.930,00:25:07.080,I give up.
00:25:08.290,00:25:09.750,王爷算是夙愿得偿了,00:25:07.204,00:25:09.050,His Lordship's wish has finally been granted.
00:25:10.920,00:25:12.080,我是担心得不行,00:25:10.000,00:25:11.380,But I cannot be more worried.
00:25:12.970,00:25:13.950,沙场无眼,00:25:11.927,00:25:13.250,The battlefield yields no mercy.
00:25:14.930,00:25:16.510,谁又知道是什么光景呢,00:25:13.910,00:25:15.810,Who knows what dangers await?
00:25:20.140,00:25:21.850,听说摩格已经住进驿站了,00:25:19.054,00:25:21.150,I've heard that Galdan is already at the relay station.
00:25:22.100,00:25:23.760,可皇上却还没有急着要见他,00:25:21.400,00:25:23.260,But Your Majesty is in no hurry to summon him.
00:25:24.520,00:25:26.220,朕想杀杀他的戾气,00:25:23.619,00:25:25.639,I am correcting his hostile temperament.
00:25:28.190,00:25:30.140,摩格远道而来 暑热攻心,00:25:27.233,00:25:29.440,Galdan has come far in the summer heat.
00:25:30.770,00:25:31.600,皇上的法子,00:25:29.727,00:25:30.900,Your Majesty's method
00:25:31.860,00:25:33.140,清凉降火是最好的,00:25:30.900,00:25:32.440,will also cool his internal Heat.
00:25:33.400,00:25:35.230,再过两日就是七月初七了,00:25:32.440,00:25:34.640,"In two days, it will be the seventh of the seventh month."
00:25:35.740,00:25:37.600,朕想挪去圆明园见他,00:25:34.640,00:25:36.700,I will move to the Summer Palace and meet him there.
00:25:38.370,00:25:40.860,有关事宜 张廷玉去安排了,00:25:37.390,00:25:39.880,Zhang Tingyu has been arranging it.
00:25:50.290,00:25:51.080,启禀皇上,00:25:49.270,00:25:50.380,"Your Majesty,"
00:25:51.710,00:25:54.500,摩格已在殿外等候觐见,00:25:50.796,00:25:53.800,Galdan is outside waiting for an audience.
00:25:55.670,00:25:56.710,宣他进来吧,00:25:54.970,00:25:56.010,Summon him in.
00:25:57.010,00:25:57.590,嗻,00:25:56.310,00:25:56.890,Yes.
00:26:00.800,00:26:04.970,宣摩格可汗觐见,00:26:00.100,00:26:04.270,Khagan Galdan is summoned by His Majesty.
00:26:12.070,00:26:14.230,喜欢的东西就是喜欢,00:26:11.370,00:26:13.530,We Dzungars are not shy about what we like.
00:26:14.860,00:26:17.850,还要想方设法地得到它,00:26:14.160,00:26:17.150,We do everything we can to acquire it.
00:26:26.000,00:26:28.580,我可汗来朝 参拜大清皇帝,00:26:25.300,00:26:27.880,"Our Khagan is here to pay his respects
to the Emperor of the Great Qing."
00:26:35.960,00:26:37.370,准葛尔既来觐见,00:26:35.260,00:26:36.910,"Dzungar comes to pay respect,"
00:26:38.180,00:26:40.710,为何不以我大清规矩面见圣上,00:26:37.223,00:26:39.682,"so why don't you follow the protocol of the Great Qing
when greeting His Majesty?"
00:26:43.510,00:26:48.760,有朋自远方来 不亦乐乎,00:26:42.570,00:26:48.060,"""Isn't it a pleasure to have friends visit from afar?""
[from The Analects, in Dzungar language]"
00:26:50.350,00:26:51.760,今日是七月初七,00:26:49.650,00:26:51.220,Today is the seventh of the seventh month.
00:26:52.150,00:26:54.100,皇上设家宴款待至亲挚友,00:26:51.220,00:26:53.210,His Majesty is treating family and friends with a family banquet.
00:26:55.070,00:26:57.060,既然可汗用准葛尔语说,00:26:54.169,00:26:56.360,"Khagan, you said in your own language"
00:26:57.570,00:26:59.400,有朋自远方来 不亦乐乎,00:26:56.870,00:26:58.700,"""It's a pleasure to have friends visit from afar."""
00:26:59.990,00:27:03.150,那么自然君子敬而无失,00:26:59.130,00:27:02.450,"you should also know:
""The Noble Man is reverential and orderly in his own conduct,"
00:27:03.580,00:27:04.690,与人恭而有礼,00:27:02.520,00:27:04.380,and respectful to others and observant of the proprieties.
00:27:05.080,00:27:07.320,四海之内皆兄弟也,00:27:04.380,00:27:06.720,"Then all within the four seas will be his brothers.""
[quoted from The Analects]"
00:27:09.410,00:27:10.870,故人许久不见哪,00:27:08.336,00:27:10.170,"My old friend, I haven't seen you for so long."
00:27:11.500,00:27:12.960,可汗风采依旧,00:27:10.520,00:27:12.260,Khagan is still as spirited as ever.
00:27:13.920,00:27:17.290,可汗似乎很喜欢论语,00:27:13.220,00:27:16.590,It seems Khagan is very fond of The Analects of Confucius.
00:27:18.760,00:27:21.120,朕的十七弟果郡王,00:27:17.780,00:27:20.420,"My seventeenth brother, State Prince Guo"
00:27:21.760,00:27:23.750,最通诗书风雅之事,00:27:20.846,00:27:23.050,is well-versed in prose and poetry.
00:27:24.930,00:27:27.670,可汗有空可与他多多切磋,00:27:23.887,00:27:26.970,You can speak further with him when you have time.
00:27:51.870,00:27:54.870,汉人祭祀死者时才以酒浇地,00:27:50.929,00:27:53.929,Han people pour wine onto the ground to honor the dead.
00:27:55.540,00:27:56.750,你在诅咒本汗,00:27:54.560,00:27:56.050,You are cursing me!
00:27:57.170,00:27:59.960,可汗误会了 本宫并非诅咒,00:27:56.269,00:27:59.059,Khagan misunderstands. I am not cursing you.
00:28:00.760,00:28:02.920,而是以贵宾礼仪迎接可汗,00:27:59.779,00:28:01.939,I am greeting Khagan with the etiquette for noble guests.
00:28:03.760,00:28:05.090,可汗乃天朝贵宾,00:28:02.580,00:28:05.555,"Khagan is a noble guest to the Nation of Heaven,
so the first cup of wine"
00:28:05.430,00:28:08.300,这第一杯酒便是感谢皇天后土,00:28:05.735,00:28:08.806," thanks ""Imperial Heaven and Earth"" for leading our delightful guest here."
00:28:08.600,00:28:09.810,引来佳客之喜,,,
00:28:11.020,00:28:13.100,此话未免太牵强了吧,00:28:10.320,00:28:12.400,Your explanation is far-fetched.
00:28:14.230,00:28:15.510,可汗不必过责,00:28:13.329,00:28:14.810,There is no need to see fault.
00:28:16.570,00:28:18.180,每常大清与准葛尔来往,00:28:15.669,00:28:17.480,The relationship between the Great Qing and Dzungar
00:28:18.530,00:28:19.440,不过是互市交易,00:28:17.659,00:28:18.980,has been the trade of goods.
00:28:20.150,00:28:22.020,多日来却兵戎相见,00:28:19.450,00:28:21.320,But recently we have been greeted with armaments.
00:28:22.490,00:28:23.940,准葛尔早就臣服大清,00:28:21.440,00:28:23.840,"Dzungar has already been subject to the Great Qing,
but now is warring on a battlefield."
00:28:24.240,00:28:25.100,如今却多杀戮,,,
00:28:25.620,00:28:26.820,难免彼此疏远,00:28:24.706,00:28:26.120,This inevitably drives us apart.
00:28:27.240,00:28:28.860,若今日因可汗到来,00:28:26.369,00:28:28.289,"If your visit today, Khagan"
00:28:29.160,00:28:31.900,而使准葛尔和大清和平相处,00:28:28.460,00:28:31.480,"can bring peaceful coexistence between the Great Qing and Dzungar,"
00:28:32.660,00:28:35.080,自然日后少误会而多亲近,00:28:31.760,00:28:34.380,we will have more familiarity and fewer misunderstandings.
00:28:35.580,00:28:37.750,黎民也能因此得福了,00:28:34.880,00:28:37.050,It will be fortunate for the common people.
00:28:38.460,00:28:40.700,熹贵妃真是伶牙俐齿啊,00:28:37.760,00:28:40.000,Your Noble Highness is clever with words.
00:28:41.340,00:28:43.550,一点也不像终日处于后宫,00:28:40.640,00:28:42.850,You don't sound like a woman
00:28:43.930,00:28:45.590,而足不出户之人哪,00:28:43.059,00:28:44.890,who has never stepped out of the harem.
00:28:47.140,00:28:48.170,可汗见笑了,00:28:46.226,00:28:47.840,"Khagan, I hope I did not incur ridicule from you."
00:28:48.970,00:28:50.340,本宫才疏学浅,00:28:47.884,00:28:49.640,I am lacking in talent and knowledge.
00:28:50.890,00:28:53.550,略有所懂也是皇上偶然指点,00:28:50.190,00:28:52.850,"What little I know is owed to occasions when I received
 His Majesty's enlightenment."
00:28:54.100,00:28:56.310,怎敢担当可汗如此赞许呢,00:28:53.160,00:28:55.610,I do not merit Khagan's generous compliment.
00:28:57.110,00:28:59.970,熹贵妃所言正得朕心,00:28:56.196,00:28:59.270,Noble Consort Lumière's words are agreeable to my heart.
00:29:01.440,00:29:03.860,请可汗满饮此杯,00:29:00.440,00:29:03.160,"Khagan, please drink this cup"
00:29:04.910,00:29:07.270,以尽今日相见之欢,00:29:03.953,00:29:06.570,to celebrate the joy of us meeting.
00:29:12.790,00:29:15.580,好 祝大清皇帝,00:29:12.090,00:29:14.880,Very well. I wish the Emperor of the Great Qing
00:29:16.080,00:29:18.420,福履绥之 寿考绵鸿,00:29:15.166,00:29:17.720,undisturbed blessings and unending longevity.
00:29:27.680,00:29:28.340,坐,00:29:26.766,00:29:27.640,Sit.
00:29:37.480,00:29:38.090,来人,00:29:36.780,00:29:37.610,My attendant.
00:29:38.310,00:29:38.890,到,00:29:37.610,00:29:38.560,Yes.
00:29:39.520,00:29:42.480,今日既是七月七乞巧之日,00:29:38.820,00:29:41.780,"Today is the seventh of the seventh month,
the day of ""begging for craftiness""."
00:29:43.690,00:29:46.610,本汗也有一巧物与众人共赏,00:29:42.990,00:29:45.910,I have an ingenious item to share with everyone.
00:29:47.610,00:29:50.570,多年前 本汗曾得一九连玉环,00:29:46.910,00:29:49.870,"Many years ago, I obtained these Nine-Linked Jade Rings."
00:29:51.540,00:29:54.620,听闻乃西域采玉工匠赔上性命,00:29:50.840,00:29:53.680,I heard that an artisan of the Western Regions risked his life
00:29:54.870,00:29:55.780,才得此美玉,00:29:53.680,00:29:55.200,"to find this beautiful jade,"
00:29:56.870,00:29:59.330,又费尽心思琢成此环,00:29:55.890,00:29:58.630,and exerted his mind to carve it into the nine rings.
00:30:01.210,00:30:03.450,都说中原多智者,00:30:00.000,00:30:02.750,I have heard there are many wise men in the Central Plains.
00:30:05.130,00:30:07.790,能否请大清皇帝为本汗,00:30:04.430,00:30:07.090,May I ask the Emperor of Great Qing
00:30:08.090,00:30:10.250,解开这九连玉环呢,00:30:07.390,00:30:09.550,to solve this puzzle for me?
00:30:12.220,00:30:14.880,拿到堂下请诸臣遍观,00:30:11.520,00:30:14.180,Display it for all the officials to see.
00:30:15.640,00:30:18.050,谁能解开 朕自有重赏,00:30:14.940,00:30:17.350,The one who solves it will be greatly rewarded.
00:30:18.730,00:30:19.310,嗻,00:30:18.030,00:30:18.720,Aye.
00:30:20.770,00:30:21.980,上歌舞,00:30:19.830,00:30:21.280,Let the song and dance begin.

00:31:50.280,00:31:51.890,这玉环浑若天成,00:31:49.280,00:31:52.600,"These rings may as well have been carved by Heaven.
There is no way to disconnect them."
00:31:52.160,00:31:53.320,实在无法解开啊,,,
00:31:55.160,00:31:56.190,您再好好看看,00:31:54.120,00:31:56.851,Please take a closer look. Look carefully.
00:31:56.540,00:31:57.820,你再仔细看看吧,,,
00:32:12.680,00:32:13.460,回禀皇上,00:32:11.840,00:32:12.920,"Your Majesty,"
00:32:14.800,00:32:15.710,无人能解,00:32:13.800,00:32:15.290,no one could unlink the rings.
00:32:21.140,00:32:23.010,给诸位王爷瞰瞰,00:32:20.000,00:32:22.310,Show them to the princes.

00:32:28.980,00:32:30.470,本王爷看着眼花,00:32:28.120,00:32:29.770,They make my eyes dizzy.
00:32:43.620,00:32:44.610,臣弟也不知道,00:32:42.640,00:32:44.240,"I don't know either, Your Majesty."

00:32:52.300,00:32:53.000,不懂这些,00:32:51.320,00:32:52.540,I don't know much about them.
00:32:54.800,00:32:55.790,熹贵妃,00:32:53.960,00:32:55.400,Noble Consort Lumière.
00:33:09.770,00:33:10.600,臣妾无能,00:33:08.720,00:33:10.214,"Your Majesty, I'm incompetent."
00:33:11.740,00:33:15.320,原来大清多智者只是误传罢了,00:33:10.720,00:33:14.740,"So saying: ""The Great Qing has many wise men""
is simply incorrect."
00:33:22.500,00:33:23.080,胧月,00:33:21.600,00:33:22.600,Longyue.
00:33:28.340,00:33:29.870,到时候你先,00:33:27.320,00:33:29.059,"Then, you will first..."
00:33:34.720,00:33:38.080,皇阿玛 女儿有一法子 或许可解,00:33:33.760,00:33:37.260,"Father, I have a way that may unlink the rings."
00:33:39.100,00:33:41.130,连朝中官员亦不得其法,00:33:38.080,00:33:40.479,Even the government officials could not find a solution.
00:33:42.020,00:33:44.630,你一个小女儿家能有什么办法,00:33:41.280,00:33:43.890,What can a little girl like you do?
00:33:45.230,00:33:46.470,女儿年幼年知,00:33:44.330,00:33:45.950,I am young and unskilled.
00:33:46.850,00:33:48.220,即使是想错了法子,00:33:45.950,00:33:49.120,"Even if my way is wrong, no one will laugh at me."
00:33:48.610,00:33:49.890,也不会贻笑大方,,,
00:33:50.400,00:33:52.810,皇阿玛不如让女儿一试,00:33:49.369,00:33:51.830,"Imperial Father, why not let me have a try?"
00:33:53.690,00:33:54.270,也好,00:33:52.750,00:33:53.760,Might as well.
00:34:02.580,00:34:04.190,皇阿玛 我解开啦,00:34:01.560,00:34:03.490,"Imperial Father, I unlinked them."
00:34:16.010,00:34:19.170,胧月最得朕心,00:34:15.000,00:34:18.400,Longyue is favorite in my heart!
00:34:23.720,00:34:25.460,你无需赞本公主聪明,00:34:22.540,00:34:24.960,No need to praise me for my intelligence.
00:34:26.100,00:34:28.720,这法子大清子民人人皆知,00:34:25.120,00:34:27.900,The people of the Great Qing all know this method.
00:34:29.020,00:34:30.760,只是不屑于告诉你罢了,00:34:27.900,00:34:30.000,They just didn't bother to show you.
00:34:31.650,00:34:34.010,你 这九连玉环价值连城,00:34:30.390,00:34:33.200,You! The Nine-Linked Jade Rings are priceless.
00:34:34.320,00:34:35.930,你所说的连城之物,00:34:33.400,00:34:36.720,"The ""priceless"" treasure to you
is only a common item to me."
00:34:36.320,00:34:37.650,我却司空见惯,,,
00:34:38.030,00:34:40.610,为了一玉环失了使臣气度,00:34:37.080,00:34:42.553,"If Dzungar's emissary loses his manners over a jade ring,
it will make the Dzungars look cheap."
00:34:40.820,00:34:43.160,让人觉得准葛尔小气,,,
00:34:45.620,00:34:47.240,即便你司空见惯,00:34:44.720,00:34:46.800,"Even if you regard the rings as ordinary,"
00:34:47.750,00:34:49.950,但此物乃我准葛尔宝物,00:34:46.800,00:34:49.080,they are still a treasure of the Dzungars.
00:34:50.710,00:34:53.330,你损我宝物 该当何解呀,00:34:49.640,00:34:52.644,"You destroyed our treasure.
How will you resolve that?"
00:34:54.000,00:34:54.580,胧月,00:34:53.300,00:34:54.240,Longyue.
00:34:56.760,00:34:58.840,公主年幼 可汗息怒,00:34:55.803,00:34:58.140,"The princess is young.
Khagan, please calm your anger."
00:34:59.550,00:35:00.340,恭喜可汗,00:34:58.850,00:35:00.000,"Congratulations, Khagan!"
00:35:01.430,00:35:02.290,公主善举,00:35:00.720,00:35:03.980,"The princess has brought a sign
of peace and harmony to the Dzungars."
00:35:02.600,00:35:04.680,倒是为准葛尔带来祥和之气,00:35:04.040,00:35:05.850,Jade has a yin nature.
00:35:05.390,00:35:06.550,玉乃阴盛之物,,,
00:35:06.770,00:35:09.010,又损人命 伤阴鹭 大是不祥啊,00:35:05.850,00:35:08.310,"Excess yin gravely damages one's merit.
It is very ill-omened."
00:35:09.520,00:35:10.550,公主砸碎此物,00:35:08.550,00:35:11.690,"By breaking the jade rings the princess
has indeed dispelled such ominous energy"
00:35:10.900,00:35:12.390,倒是破解了阴鹭之气,,,
00:35:12.690,00:35:14.020,为准葛尔带来祥和,00:35:11.690,00:35:13.906,and brought auspiciousness to the Dzungars.
00:35:14.820,00:35:17.900,是啊 玉环碎可汗难免不快,00:35:13.906,00:35:17.200,Indeed. It's natural that Khagan is disgruntled by the broken jade.
00:35:18.240,00:35:20.850,可请宫中巧匠做成金镶玉环,00:35:17.200,00:35:20.165,"Why not ask skilled jewelers in the palace
to make it into gold-inlaid jade rings?"
00:35:21.320,00:35:24.160,金主阳气 可缓玉之阴气,00:35:20.405,00:35:23.460,"The yang energy of gold
will balance the yin energy of jade,"
00:35:24.580,00:35:27.410,此乃富贵祥和之兆啊,00:35:23.666,00:35:26.710,becoming an omen of good fortune and peace.
00:35:28.160,00:35:29.990,敬贵妃所言极好,00:35:27.117,00:35:29.290,Noble Consort Estime's thoughts are excellent.
00:35:31.250,00:35:32.610,玉碎尚能修复,00:35:30.293,00:35:31.840,The broken jade can be repaired.
00:35:32.960,00:35:34.820,若彼此交恶难免战乱,00:35:32.020,00:35:34.120,"But if two countries break their relations, war is inevitable."
00:35:35.380,00:35:37.370,何不也如金镶玉之法,00:35:34.423,00:35:36.327,"Just as we reform jade with gold,"
00:35:37.760,00:35:38.840,化干戈为玉帛,00:35:36.327,00:35:38.340,why don't we transform our spears into jade-inlaid gifts?
00:35:39.220,00:35:41.000,不知可汗是否愿意,00:35:38.520,00:35:40.300,"Khagan, are you willing to do so?"
00:35:43.260,00:35:45.130,以蝼蚁档一猛兽,00:35:42.260,00:35:44.430,A mere ant tries to stop a mighty beast.
00:35:46.260,00:35:47.970,皇帝以为如何呀,00:35:45.346,00:35:47.510,"What do you think will happen, Emperor?"
00:35:55.270,00:35:55.890,皇上,00:35:54.090,00:35:55.190,"Your Majesty,"
00:35:56.940,00:35:58.480,这是新酿的橙酒,00:35:55.897,00:35:57.780,this orange wine is freshly made.
00:35:59.440,00:36:00.400,皇上尝尝鲜,00:35:58.460,00:35:59.700,Please have a taste.
00:36:04.780,00:36:07.450,张廷玉大人让奴才来转告皇上,00:36:04.080,00:36:06.750,Mr. Zhang Tingyu asked me to report to Your Majesty
00:36:07.830,00:36:10.440,岳钟麒大人那儿已经得手了,00:36:06.750,00:36:09.740,that General Yue Zhongqi has succeeded.
00:36:14.130,00:36:17.290,猛兽有猛兽之力,00:36:13.173,00:36:16.590,"Beasts have their strength,"
00:36:18.800,00:36:21.540,蝼蚁有蝼蚁之慧,00:36:17.757,00:36:20.840,yet ants have their own type of wisdom.
00:36:23.430,00:36:27.800,可汗就一定觉得能定输赢吗,00:36:22.450,00:36:27.100,"Khagan, do you really think success is guaranteed?"
00:36:29.350,00:36:32.260,仿佛蝼蚁在节节败退呀,00:36:28.264,00:36:31.240,It seems the ants are retreating step by step.
00:36:32.600,00:36:33.560,以退为进,00:36:31.240,00:36:32.981,"""Retreating, in order to advance."""
00:36:34.400,00:36:36.890,可汗想必读过兵书吧,00:36:33.443,00:36:36.190,I believe Khagan is familiar with military books.
00:36:37.520,00:36:39.360,本汗也想如此揣测,00:36:36.606,00:36:38.660,I certainly would like to believe so.
00:36:40.400,00:36:43.520,但愿不是信口开河就好,00:36:39.357,00:36:42.760,"I hope it's not just ""empty words from smacking lips."""
00:36:43.820,00:36:44.940,可汗取笑了,00:36:42.760,00:36:44.240,Khagan teases me.
00:36:45.740,00:36:48.450,朕为天子一言九鼎,00:36:45.040,00:36:47.750,"As the Son of Heaven, my words carry weight."
00:36:49.200,00:36:51.110,听闻龙生九子,00:36:48.157,00:36:50.410,I heard that the Dragon has nine sons.
00:36:51.960,00:36:54.870,上天之子未必只有一个,00:36:51.260,00:36:54.170,"There could be more than one ""Son of Heaven""."
00:36:55.830,00:37:00.080,既然本是同根生 相煎何太急,00:36:54.873,00:36:59.380,"""Born of the same root, why be hasty to fight each other?"""
00:37:01.210,00:37:04.420,准葛尔本属大清 朕自然关心,00:37:00.000,00:37:03.720,"Dzungar has been a part of the Great Qing,
so naturally I take an interest."
00:37:05.840,00:37:07.550,听闻准葛尔的大军,00:37:05.140,00:37:09.840,"I heard the Dzungar army has been afflicted
with an illness at the Yanming Pass."
00:37:07.800,00:37:10.640,在雁鸣关外得了些小疫病,,,
00:37:12.390,00:37:13.470,大兵在外,00:37:11.220,00:37:12.930,"The army is away from home,"
00:37:14.350,00:37:15.890,医药怕是不足,00:37:13.393,00:37:15.350,and medical supplies may be limited.
00:37:17.650,00:37:20.680,大清前几年也得过时疫,00:37:16.590,00:37:19.980,"A few years ago, the Great Qing also experienced a plague."
00:37:21.860,00:37:23.230,朕倒有些秘方,00:37:20.946,00:37:22.810,I  know of effective remedies.
00:37:24.360,00:37:25.690,可汗若是需要,00:37:23.446,00:37:25.190,"If you need them, Khagan,"
00:37:26.490,00:37:28.480,朕倒可派人去找一找,00:37:25.576,00:37:27.780,I can send someone to look for them.
00:37:29.080,00:37:30.240,多谢皇帝好意,00:37:28.100,00:37:30.000,"Thank you, Emperor, for your kind offer."
00:37:31.200,00:37:33.410,本汗自己派人去找就是了,00:37:30.500,00:37:32.710,I will send my own men to search for them.
00:37:34.910,00:37:35.740,也好吧,00:37:33.953,00:37:35.320,All right then.
00:37:36.830,00:37:39.320,只是这些医士云游四海,00:37:36.130,00:37:38.620,But these doctors travel all over the country
00:37:39.960,00:37:41.290,方子随身携带,00:37:38.900,00:37:40.590,and carry the formulas with them.
00:37:42.300,00:37:43.830,朕派人去寻,00:37:41.240,00:37:43.130,"Even if I send someone to find them now,"
00:37:44.090,00:37:45.750,只怕也需要两三个月,00:37:43.390,00:37:45.050,it may still take two to three months.
00:37:47.140,00:37:49.970,但愿可汗一切顺利,00:37:46.140,00:37:49.270,"I hope everything goes smoothly for you, Khagan."
00:38:15.210,00:38:16.320,臣妾先去更衣,00:38:14.510,00:38:16.060,"Your Majesty, please allow me to go get changed."
00:38:26.720,00:38:27.960,娘娘 苏公公,00:38:26.020,00:38:27.460,"-Your Highness.

00:38:30.140,00:38:33.670,岳钟麒大人佯装与准葛尔部对峙,00:38:29.440,00:38:32.970,"General Yue Zhongqi pretended to confront the Dzungar army,"
00:38:34.100,00:38:35.840,日音里派精骑突袭了,00:38:33.400,00:38:36.520,but secretly sent elite cavalry to raid their supply lines.
00:38:36.060,00:38:37.270,准葛尔的粮草大军,00:38:37.103,00:38:38.360,"Without food and supplies,"
00:38:38.060,00:38:38.890,没了粮草,,,
00:38:39.190,00:38:41.430,准葛尔的士兵又染上了时疫,00:38:38.490,00:38:40.730,"and with the Dzungar soldiers afflicted by the plague,"
00:38:42.400,00:38:44.230,奴才倒要瞧瞧这个摩格,00:38:41.700,00:38:44.760,I would like to see how this Galdan can still act so arrogantly!
00:38:44.530,00:38:45.480,还怎么个横法,,,
00:38:46.400,00:38:47.890,真是好消息 是啊,00:38:45.700,00:38:47.540,"-This is excellent news.

,,,00:38:50.000,00:38:51.166,I'll be there right away.
00:38:50.780,00:38:51.570,本宫即刻就来,00:38:51.166,00:38:51.910,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:38:52.080,00:38:52.610,是,,,
00:38:56.200,00:38:56.820,娘娘留步,00:38:55.066,00:38:56.480,"A moment of your time, Your Highness!"
00:39:06.460,00:39:07.370,可汗万福,00:39:05.760,00:39:07.030,Grace to Khagan.
00:39:08.840,00:39:10.500,熹贵妃别来无恙啊,00:39:07.926,00:39:09.800,"It's been a long time, is Your Noble Highness well?"
00:39:14.510,00:39:15.750,可汗此话差矣,00:39:13.553,00:39:15.050,"Your words confuse me, Khagan."
00:39:17.020,00:39:18.430,本宫从未见过可汗,00:39:16.320,00:39:17.730,I never met Khagan before.
00:39:18.980,00:39:20.590,何来别来无恙之说呢,00:39:18.066,00:39:19.890,"Why did you say ""a long time""?"
00:39:23.230,00:39:24.810,本汗有鹰的眼睛,00:39:22.530,00:39:24.320,"I have the eyes of an eagle,"
00:39:25.400,00:39:26.690,见人过目不忘,00:39:24.400,00:39:26.190,and can remember any face at a glance.
00:39:27.440,00:39:28.100,熹贵妃,00:39:26.440,00:39:27.720,"Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:39:28.860,00:39:30.650,你的胆子倒是大得很,00:39:28.160,00:39:29.950,you are so very daring
00:39:31.610,00:39:33.950,竟敢和皇帝的亲弟弟私通,00:39:30.696,00:39:33.250,to have committed adultery with the Emperor's brother!
00:39:39.960,00:39:41.540,本宫从未得罪可汗,00:39:38.960,00:39:40.840,I have never offended Khagan.
00:39:42.420,00:39:44.780,可汗为何要置本宫于灭门之罪呢,00:39:41.292,00:39:44.730,"Why would you accuse me of a crime
that could cost my family their lives?"
00:39:45.670,00:39:48.000,你就不怕我将当年之事,00:39:44.970,00:39:49.280,Are you afraid I'll tell your Emperor the story of the past?
00:39:48.460,00:39:49.750,告诉你们皇帝吗,,,
00:39:52.260,00:39:53.380,什么当年之事,00:39:51.260,00:39:52.680,"What ""story of the past""?"
00:39:56.890,00:39:59.050,果郡王的侧福晋是本宫的妹妹,00:39:55.890,00:39:58.693,My sister is Noble Prince Guo's Lord Consort.
00:40:00.060,00:40:01.470,与本宫相貌相似,00:39:59.103,00:40:00.770,We look quite alike.
00:40:02.520,00:40:04.680,听闻当年王爷与侧福晋同游,00:40:01.820,00:40:03.980,I heard years ago she was traveling with His Lordship
00:40:05.520,00:40:07.060,遇见可汗被蛇所伤,00:40:04.434,00:40:06.360,and happened to find Khagan injured by a snake.
00:40:08.900,00:40:10.190,今日故人相逢,00:40:07.857,00:40:09.734,Today old friends meet again.
00:40:10.820,00:40:11.810,王爷和侧福晋,00:40:09.734,00:40:13.800,"They have said they hope to ""clink goblets"" with the Khagan."
00:40:12.360,00:40:14.570,正打算要和可汗好好碰几杯呢,,,
00:40:22.960,00:40:23.700,熹贵妃,00:40:22.260,00:40:23.376,"Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:40:24.290,00:40:26.080,你真是能言巧辩啊,00:40:23.376,00:40:25.380,you surely have a way with words.
00:40:27.420,00:40:28.630,像熹贵妃这样,00:40:26.720,00:40:29.920,A woman as intelligent and beautiful as you
00:40:28.880,00:40:31.210,既聪慧又俊俏的女人,,,
00:40:32.090,00:40:33.750,你们大清皇帝喜欢,00:40:31.090,00:40:33.050,is not only adored by your Emperor
00:40:34.510,00:40:36.500,本汗也喜欢,00:40:33.553,00:40:35.800,but by me as well.
00:40:38.220,00:40:39.010,可汗醉了,00:40:37.263,00:40:38.710,Khagan must be drunk.
00:40:39.890,00:40:40.880,本宫去禀告皇上,00:40:38.976,00:40:41.501,"I'll go inform His Majesty, and order Khagan a tonic to sober up."
00:40:41.270,00:40:42.380,给可汗做碗醒酒汤,00:40:41.933,00:40:43.170,No need for that.
00:40:42.890,00:40:43.510,不必了,,,
00:40:44.940,00:40:46.720,你以为本汗真的,00:40:44.240,00:40:47.440,Do you really think I'm afraid of your Emperor?
00:40:46.940,00:40:48.150,怕你们大清皇帝吗,,,
00:40:49.480,00:40:51.020,他偷烧我大军粮草,00:40:48.437,00:40:50.320,"He sneakily burned our food and supplies,"
00:40:51.530,00:40:52.690,用时疫要挟,00:40:50.320,00:40:52.080,and used the plague to threaten me.
00:40:53.450,00:40:55.310,手段真是太卑鄙了,00:40:52.407,00:40:54.610,What despicable tricks!
00:40:55.910,00:40:58.320,可汗怎会不知兵不厌诈这一说呢,00:40:54.953,00:40:57.620,"Khagan must know ""Deception is a strategy in warfare."""
00:40:58.790,00:41:02.570,祸兮福之所倚 福兮祸之所伏,00:40:57.889,00:41:02.588,"""Misery - happiness is to be found by its side!

don't you think I will find a way to gain from this loss?"
00:41:06.630,00:41:10.460,本汗既有失 也必定有得,,,
00:41:13.510,00:41:15.120,只要能兵戈化玉帛,00:41:12.810,00:41:14.843,"So long as this war ends,"
00:41:15.680,00:41:17.090,对大清 对准葛尔部,00:41:14.843,00:41:17.760,it will be a gain and blessing for both the Great Qing and the Dzungars.

00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:18.300,00:43:35.300,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:35.300,00:43:53.300,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:53.300,00:44:01.300,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:01.300,00:44:13.300,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:13.300,00:44:32.300,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
00:44:33.000,00:44:41.000,"You can hear the flapping of a phoenix
but you will never see it.",00:44:32.300,00:44:40.300,"A phoenix about to take flight rustles its wings
but the arc of its flight is unseen."
00:44:41.000,00:44:47.600,What you see is the falling leaves from the phoenix tree.,00:44:40.300,00:44:46.900,"The phoenix tree sways in the wind,
shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
00:44:51.000,00:45:04.000,The falling leaves from the phoenix tree.,00:44:50.300,00:45:03.300,"The phoenix tree sways in the wind,
shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
