00:02:48.320,00:02:49.270,才当上答应,,,
00:02:49.560,00:02:50.910,她摆这样的威风给谁看,00:02:49.519,00:02:52.300,"She just became a Companion.
Who is she showing off to?"
00:02:54.160,00:02:56.540,背后议论小主 成什么体统,00:02:55.700,00:02:58.356,A maid does not speak of a concubine like that.
00:02:58.320,00:02:59.460,奴婢再也不敢了,,,
00:03:00.720,00:03:01.940,她如今得宠,00:02:59.540,00:03:00.920,I won't do it again.
00:03:02.360,00:03:04.920,你越议论她 自己的是非就越多,00:03:01.969,00:03:06.320,"The more you talk about a favored concubine,

00:03:35.520,00:03:37.870,臣妾听说不是每一位嫔妃,,,
00:03:38.200,00:03:39.230,都侍寝过,00:03:36.778,00:03:40.320,I was told that not every concubine has served Your Majesty.

00:03:42.840,00:03:44.950,淳常在年纪太小,,,
00:03:45.200,00:03:47.550,完全不解世事 还有别人吗,00:03:43.997,00:03:47.340,"Attendant Chun is too young.
She knows nothing of worldly matters."
00:03:48.520,00:03:50.190,还有一位安答应,00:03:47.793,00:03:49.256,Is there anyone else?

00:04:04.600,00:04:05.660,我还能去哪儿,,,
00:04:05.960,00:04:07.630,不过是去沈贵人那里坐坐,00:04:05.900,00:04:08.800,Where else can I go? I was visiting Lady Shen.
00:04:09.280,00:04:10.790,花房不是一直都说,,,
00:04:11.080,00:04:12.790,没有这些名贵的玉台金盏吗,00:04:10.480,00:04:14.220,"Hasn't the flower house always said that
they don't have such precious narcissus?"
00:04:13.440,00:04:15.030,怎么今日送了这样多来,,,

00:04:19.200,00:04:20.830,今夜由小主侍寝,00:04:18.634,00:04:22.314,"Attendant Services has announced
that you will serve His Majesty tonight."
00:04:23.480,00:04:24.230,你说什么,,,
00:04:24.840,00:04:26.390,今儿是小主的好日子啊,00:04:24.600,00:04:25.760,What?
00:04:26.840,00:04:28.310,皇上翻了小主的牌子,00:04:25.980,00:04:29.616,"It's an auspicious day for you, My Lady!"
00:04:29.040,00:04:30.260,这不消息一传过来,,,
00:04:30.800,00:04:32.990,花房的奴才就送来了许多的鲜花,00:04:30.220,00:04:34.180,The flower house sent all these after this news arrived.
00:04:33.800,00:04:36.070,连御膳房也送了东阿阿胶,00:04:34.880,00:04:37.880,"The Imperial Kitchen sent you Dong'e ejiao.

Let me help you get ready."
00:04:42.200,00:04:45.470,我还以为皇上只当没我这个人呢,00:04:43.420,00:04:46.809,I thought His Majesty had forgotten I existed.
00:04:49.920,00:04:51.190,小主不用急,,,
00:04:51.960,00:04:53.910,皇上现在还在批折子,00:04:51.118,00:04:52.711,"There's no rush, My Lady."
00:04:54.320,00:04:55.350,要晚些过来,00:04:53.202,00:04:56.623,"His Majesty is still working.
He'll be ready a bit late."
00:04:56.280,00:04:59.510,待会儿啊 奴才们把小主抬进去,00:04:57.384,00:05:00.880,The servants will carry you into the chamber.
00:05:00.200,00:05:03.470,小主躺着等皇上就是了,00:05:01.710,00:05:04.434,You'll wait for His Majesty lying down.
00:05:06.840,00:05:09.300,小主这是怎么了,00:05:08.843,00:05:10.638,"What's wrong, My Lady?"
00:05:10.480,00:05:14.020,姑姑 不知怎的 我好害怕,00:05:11.619,00:05:15.391,Madam... I don't know why I feel so scared.
00:05:15.120,00:05:16.030,不用怕啊,00:05:16.457,00:05:18.209,No need to be afraid.
00:06:17.080,00:06:17.870,怎么了,00:06:18.156,00:06:19.256,What's wrong?
00:06:19.040,00:06:21.310,臣妾臣妾,00:06:19.520,00:06:22.440,Your Majesty ... I ...
00:06:23.640,00:06:24.750,朕又不凶,00:06:24.920,00:06:26.492,I'm not that scary.
00:06:25.560,00:06:28.020,侍寝的规矩嬷嬷没教过你吗,00:06:26.831,00:06:29.382,Did the madam not tell you the rules?
00:06:33.200,00:06:35.580,朕不喜欢勉强 改日吧,00:06:34.481,00:06:37.312,I don't like to force anyone. Maybe next time.
00:06:36.480,00:06:37.310,苏培盛,00:06:37.500,00:06:38.651,Su Peisheng.
00:06:40.360,00:06:41.110,奴才在,,,
00:06:41.840,00:06:42.710,抬走吧,00:06:41.500,00:06:42.640,Your Majesty.
,,,00:06:42.929,00:06:44.299,Take her away.
00:06:44.200,00:06:46.390,接余答应来,00:06:46.080,00:06:48.140,Call for Companion Yu.
00:06:47.880,00:06:48.830,嗻,00:06:49.231,00:06:50.300,Yes.
00:06:58.720,00:07:01.710,真晦气 从没当过这样的差事,00:07:00.240,00:07:03.305,What bad luck! We've never had a task like this.
00:07:02.360,00:07:03.670,送进养心殿的嫔妃,,,
00:07:03.960,00:07:05.180,被原封不动地送出来,00:07:03.720,00:07:06.857,A concubine carried in and returned untouched...
00:07:37.840,00:07:40.630,怎么这么晚了谁在唱曲呢,00:07:38.981,00:07:41.921,Who is singing at this hour of the night?
00:07:42.600,00:07:44.510,想必是妙音娘子,00:07:43.820,00:07:45.834,It must be Lady Melodic.
00:07:44.840,00:07:48.150,这夜半在宫中高歌可不合规矩,00:07:46.060,00:07:49.434,It is inappropriate to sing loudly late at night.
00:07:50.480,00:07:51.790,话又说回来了,,,
00:07:52.280,00:07:53.830,皇上忙于政务,,,
00:07:54.600,00:07:56.900,也该有个活泼些的人伺候,00:07:51.980,00:07:58.076,"But on a second thought, His Majesty needs
someone cheerful by his side after a long day of work."
00:07:58.520,00:08:00.030,有位沈贵人,00:07:59.721,00:08:01.360,Is there a Noble Lady Shen?
00:08:00.280,00:08:02.710,是在选秀的时候见过,00:08:01.500,00:08:04.000,"Yes, we saw her at the Selection."
00:08:03.200,00:08:05.150,很是端庄稳重,00:08:04.339,00:08:06.390,She's gentle and dignified.
00:08:05.640,00:08:07.470,就该这样的人才好,00:08:06.880,00:08:09.090,That is who the emperor needs.
00:08:08.640,00:08:10.790,六宫的事有皇后,,,
00:08:11.280,00:08:12.990,太后颐养天年,00:08:09.844,00:08:12.455,The Empress is taking good care of the harem.
00:08:13.200,00:08:15.150,少操心才是养生之道,00:08:12.644,00:08:16.270,"Your Majesty needs to worry less
and enjoy the years granted by Heaven."
00:08:18.120,00:08:20.150,哀家就这么一个皇帝,,,
00:08:20.520,00:08:22.550,皇帝却有这么大个后宫,00:08:19.489,00:08:24.039,"I only have one emperor,
but one emperor has many a concubine."
00:08:23.480,00:08:25.390,她们不闹出格就好,,,
00:08:26.040,00:08:28.550,否则总得盯着些,00:08:24.680,00:08:29.749,I have to keep a watch in case they step out of line.
00:08:34.440,00:08:35.990,听说妹妹会唱昆曲,,,
00:08:36.480,00:08:37.830,皇上可喜欢听了,00:08:35.676,00:08:39.180,I heard that His Majesty loves your Kungqu operas.
00:08:38.880,00:08:40.710,皇上平日忙于朝政,,,
00:08:41.120,00:08:43.870,听妹妹唱上一曲最能舒心了,00:08:40.180,00:08:45.178,"His Majesty is always busy with state affairs.
Your singing helps to ease his mind."
00:08:44.480,00:08:47.190,难怪妹妹这么讨皇上欢心呢,00:08:45.668,00:08:48.440,No wonder His Majesty is so fond of you.
00:08:47.440,00:08:49.310,余妹妹都会唱什么曲啊,00:08:48.540,00:08:50.585,What songs do you sing?
00:08:50.720,00:08:53.630,遊园惊梦 是嫔妾父亲教的,00:08:52.220,00:08:54.856,"I learned ""Peony Pavilion"" from my father."
00:08:54.560,00:08:56.590,完璧归赵 会唱吗,00:08:55.738,00:08:58.240,"Do you know the song ""A Gem Returned Intact""?"
00:09:04.640,00:09:06.070,这首曲子呢,,,
00:09:06.400,00:09:07.990,得安答应自己来唱,00:09:06.000,00:09:09.280,Only Companion An can do justice to that song.
00:09:08.240,00:09:11.110,才能够情肠动人 娓娓道来呀,00:09:09.390,00:09:12.320,Only she can convey the emotions truthfully.
00:09:12.560,00:09:14.710,难为皇后一片心意,,,
00:09:15.320,00:09:17.350,结果闹出这么大的笑话,00:09:13.418,00:09:18.338,"It was a thoughtful gesture of the Empress,
but it turned out to be quite laughable."
00:09:18.520,00:09:20.670,皇后肯定气得生了好多皱纹,,,
00:09:21.080,00:09:23.380,哪比娘娘您风华正茂呢,00:09:19.723,00:09:24.603,"The Empress's face will wrinkle with disappointment.
She cannot compare to Your Highness's radiant beauty."
00:09:24.080,00:09:25.870,妹妹的嘴可真甜哪,00:09:25.244,00:09:27.467,You certainly speak with a sweet tongue.
00:09:30.600,00:09:32.980,这玉轮是本宫的哥哥,,,
00:09:33.240,00:09:34.870,差人从外面送来的,00:09:32.100,00:09:35.741,My brother had this face massager sent to me.
00:09:35.560,00:09:37.350,这可是上好的玉材,00:09:36.571,00:09:38.867,It is made of the finest jade.
00:09:37.960,00:09:40.630,用它来按脸可长葆青春,00:09:39.206,00:09:41.716,Using it can preserve youthful skin.
00:09:42.320,00:09:43.540,本宫赐于你了,00:09:43.469,00:09:45.072,I'll let you have it.
00:09:46.840,00:09:47.750,谢娘娘,00:09:47.940,00:09:49.400,I thank Your Highness.
00:09:53.120,00:09:55.500,答应出身不好 又不得皇上喜欢,00:09:54.245,00:09:56.969,Companion An has a humble birth and isn't favored by His Majesty.
00:09:55.840,00:09:57.270,这辈子呀 算是完了,,,
00:09:57.520,00:09:58.310,真可怜,00:09:56.969,00:09:58.495,Her life is over.
00:09:58.560,00:09:59.990,要是我这样被送出养心殿,,,
00:10:00.320,00:10:01.190,再也不见人了,00:09:58.520,00:10:02.692,"If I were sent out of the Palace of Mental Cultivation like her,
I would never show my face in public again."
00:10:01.440,00:10:03.310,可人家呀偏像个没事人似的,,,
00:10:03.480,00:10:04.230,是啊,00:10:02.692,00:10:04.674,But she's acting like nothing happened.
,,,00:10:04.674,00:10:05.580,She is.
00:10:08.280,00:10:11.150,小主就是小主 容不得奴才议论,00:10:09.509,00:10:12.391,A mistress is not to be discussed by her servants.
00:10:11.760,00:10:12.590,如果有人,,,
00:10:12.920,00:10:14.830,敢背后贬损自己的小主,,,
00:10:15.160,00:10:16.430,我会立刻回了皇后,00:10:12.882,00:10:18.780,"If anyone belittles their mistress,
I'll ask Her Majesty to expel them from the palace."
00:10:16.720,00:10:19.350,把他轰出宫去 记住了吗,,,
00:10:19.560,00:10:20.310,是,00:10:19.648,00:10:20.860,Is that clear?
00:10:20.520,00:10:21.310,奴才知罪,00:10:20.860,00:10:22.500,"Yes. Please forgive me, My Lady."
00:10:31.440,00:10:33.710,沈贵人万安 莞常在万安,00:10:32.594,00:10:35.200,"Peace to Noble Lady Shen.
Peace to Attendant Sourire."
00:10:35.080,00:10:36.060,姐姐坐,00:10:36.000,00:10:37.954,"- Sourire.
- Sit."
00:10:38.480,00:10:39.190,还好吧,00:10:39.700,00:10:40.929,Are you all right?
00:10:39.920,00:10:43.190,我都好 劳两位姐姐挂心了,00:10:41.149,00:10:44.389,I'm fine. Thank you both for thinking of me.
00:10:45.760,00:10:47.030,以后会好的,,,
00:10:47.560,00:10:49.550,咱们还有的是以后,00:10:47.160,00:10:48.829,Things will get better.
,,,00:10:48.829,00:10:50.884,We still have many days ahead of us.
00:10:51.480,00:10:54.830,两位姐姐还有以后 我没有了,00:10:52.909,00:10:56.469,You both have your futures. I don't.
00:11:09.320,00:11:11.310,小主 虽说到了二月里,,,
00:11:11.600,00:11:12.820,小主还是要当心身子,00:11:10.820,00:11:14.200,"My Lady, it is still cold at night in the second month."
00:11:13.640,00:11:15.910,这两日反比正月里更冷了,00:11:14.577,00:11:17.600,It does feel even colder than last month these days.
00:11:16.840,00:11:18.550,小主做了半天针线活了,,,
00:11:18.800,00:11:20.910,来 抱着暖炉暖暖吧,00:11:17.939,00:11:20.000,You have been doing needlework all night.
00:11:24.960,00:11:26.270,你说这天还冷着,00:11:20.000,00:11:22.599,"Here, keep your hands warm."
00:11:26.840,00:11:28.830,内务府备下的过冬衣裳不够,00:11:26.243,00:11:30.521,"It's so cold, and yet the Household Department
did not provide enough winter clothes."
00:11:29.440,00:11:31.230,差不多的都得自己动手,00:11:30.672,00:11:32.871,We have to make most of the clothes ourselves.
00:11:33.080,00:11:35.030,晌午我按照小主的吩咐,,,
00:11:35.280,00:11:36.790,到安小主那儿送些糕点,00:11:34.560,00:11:38.200,"When I sent the pastries to Companion An at noon,"
00:11:37.040,00:11:38.990,谁知道她们也在做针线活呢,,,
00:11:39.600,00:11:41.110,说是怕月例不够用,00:11:38.260,00:11:40.480,I saw them doing needlework too.
00:11:41.520,00:11:43.950,好歹让太监送出去换点银子,00:11:40.844,00:11:45.559,"They said the eunuchs will trade what they make
for money outside the palace."
00:11:44.560,00:11:45.540,这同是答应,,,
00:11:45.960,00:11:47.670,怎么余答应就风光得很呀,00:11:45.748,00:11:49.000,"While ranked at Companion,
why is Companion Yu getting all the glory?"
00:11:47.960,00:11:49.020,别背后多议论,,,
00:11:50.680,00:11:51.870,眉姐姐说了,00:11:49.000,00:11:50.700,Don't talk behind their backs.
00:11:52.360,00:11:54.030,皇上要缩减后宫用度,00:11:51.869,00:11:55.680,"Meizhuang told me that His Majesty is
reducing the spending in the harem."
00:11:54.600,00:11:55.990,哪个宫里不是自己做些针线活,,,
00:11:56.360,00:11:57.190,来贴补,00:11:55.792,00:11:58.720,Every palace is doing needlework to make ends meet.
00:11:58.040,00:11:59.670,好歹咱们手里还松动些,00:11:59.212,00:12:01.200,We are not short of money right now.
00:12:00.760,00:12:03.060,明儿浣碧封些银子去安答应那儿,00:12:02.000,00:12:04.480,"Jade, bring some money to Companion An tomorrow."
00:12:03.600,00:12:05.830,开了春做衣裳又是一笔开销,00:12:04.819,00:12:07.571,They'll need that for spring clothing.
00:12:06.480,00:12:07.150,是,00:12:07.722,00:12:08.599,Yes.
00:12:09.120,00:12:10.830,这么晚了谁会来呀,,,
00:12:11.240,00:12:11.910,快去看看,00:12:10.500,00:12:12.300,It's so late. Who could be knocking?
,,,00:12:12.300,00:12:13.400,Go see who it is.
00:12:18.960,00:12:20.710,淳小主 你怎么一个人来了,,,
00:12:21.080,00:12:21.870,快进来吧,00:12:20.236,00:12:22.500,Attendant Chun! Why are you here by yourself?
00:12:22.120,00:12:23.260,小主 淳小主来了,00:12:22.500,00:12:23.140,Come in.
,,,00:12:23.140,00:12:24.742,"My Lady, it's Attendant Chun."
00:12:25.160,00:12:27.270,淳儿 你怎么了,00:12:26.500,00:12:28.940,"Chun'er, what's wrong?"
00:12:29.840,00:12:30.470,别怕别怕,,,
00:12:30.720,00:12:32.070,莞姐姐我怕 拿杯奶茶来,,,
00:12:32.440,00:12:33.350,别怕 别怕,00:12:31.037,00:12:33.698,"- I was so scared.
- Don't be scared. Bring some milk tea."
00:12:33.880,00:12:34.910,淳儿别哭啊,00:12:33.698,00:12:35.960,Don't cry. Don't be scared.
00:12:36.000,00:12:37.430,喝杯奶茶慢慢说,,,
00:12:37.720,00:12:38.750,别哭啊,00:12:37.167,00:12:38.467,"Here, have some milk tea."
,,,00:12:38.467,00:12:40.392,Then tell me what's wrong. Don't cry.
00:12:42.840,00:12:43.590,来,00:12:44.000,00:12:45.160,Here.
00:12:50.280,00:12:52.510,刚才我和欣常在姐姐回宫,00:12:51.445,00:12:53.625,I was walking with Attendant Joie.
00:12:53.600,00:12:55.710,谁知宫女手里的纸灯笼,,,
00:12:56.080,00:12:57.630,被风吹着烧起来了,00:12:54.802,00:12:58.800,A maid's lantern caught fire due to the wind.
00:12:58.120,00:13:00.630,正巧余答应坐着凤鸾春恩车过来,00:12:59.290,00:13:02.446,Companion Yu happened to be passing by in the Phoenix Carriage.
00:13:01.720,00:13:03.590,驾车的马受了惊吓,,,
00:13:04.080,00:13:05.910,就把余答应震了一下,00:13:02.899,00:13:07.300,"The carriage horse was startled by the fire
and jostled Companion Yu."
00:13:06.840,00:13:08.670,可是我当时看得真真的,00:13:07.953,00:13:10.000,I saw it with my own eyes.
00:13:09.480,00:13:10.870,御马训练纯熟,,,
00:13:11.200,00:13:12.630,那一震根本不碍事,00:13:10.733,00:13:13.960,"The imperial horse was well-trained
and the jolt was mild."
00:13:14.120,00:13:16.150,可是余答应不依不饶,,,
00:13:16.440,00:13:19.510,欣常在姐姐说话也没有太客气,00:13:15.511,00:13:20.791,"But Companion Yu was unforgiving,
and Attendant Joie wasn't very polite."
00:13:20.360,00:13:22.550,这欣常在是皇上身边的老人了,,,
00:13:23.040,00:13:25.230,按位分也比余答应要高,00:13:21.395,00:13:26.420,"Attendant Joie has been a concubine for longer
and has a higher rank than Companion Yu."
00:13:25.480,00:13:27.430,是不必对余答应毕恭毕敬的呀,00:13:26.440,00:13:28.740,She doesn't need to be too deferential to Companion Yu.
00:13:27.840,00:13:30.300,余答应受宠 又有华妃撑腰,,,
00:13:30.600,00:13:31.510,一向厉害,00:13:28.891,00:13:32.933,"Companion Yu is so harsh.
She is favored by His Majesty and backed by Consort Fleur."
00:13:32.080,00:13:34.110,欣姐姐本来心里就不痛快,,,
00:13:34.520,00:13:35.910,结果两人拌起嘴来,00:13:33.235,00:13:35.631,Attendant Joie has been unhappy about that.
00:13:36.400,00:13:37.750,余答应一怒之下,00:13:35.631,00:13:37.431,They started arguing
00:13:38.200,00:13:40.760,让人把欣姐姐关进了慎刑司,00:13:37.620,00:13:42.120,"and in a fit of rage, Companion Yu
had Attendant Joie sent to the Department of Penalty."
00:13:41.840,00:13:42.820,慎刑司,00:13:42.837,00:13:44.320,The Department of Penalty?
00:13:44.800,00:13:45.750,那是犯了错的宫人,,,
00:13:46.200,00:13:47.150,关押受刑的地方,00:13:45.981,00:13:48.540,That is the detention place for servants.
00:13:48.080,00:13:49.430,欣常在怎么能去那儿呢,00:13:49.278,00:13:50.967,How can Attendant Joie be sent there?
00:13:50.640,00:13:52.830,皇上和皇后也没有发话过问吗,00:13:51.873,00:13:54.456,Did His Majesty and Her Majesty not say anything?
00:13:53.880,00:13:54.790,余答应说了,,,
00:13:55.520,00:13:57.190,要是惊扰了皇上 皇后,,,
00:13:57.560,00:13:58.990,就拿慎刑司总管是问,00:13:54.909,00:14:00.280,"Companion Yu said she would hold the department responsible
if Their Majesties were disturbed."
00:14:00.000,00:14:02.630,余氏如此蛮横 真是闻所未闻哪,00:14:01.158,00:14:03.998,How imperious. I've never heard of such a ridiculous thing.
00:14:04.800,00:14:07.360,莞姐姐 眼下该怎么办呢,00:14:05.958,00:14:08.476,"Sourire, what should we do?"
00:14:10.160,00:14:10.990,别哭了啊,,,
00:14:12.400,00:14:13.230,小允子,00:14:11.360,00:14:12.776,Don't worry.
00:14:13.640,00:14:14.430,奴才在,00:14:13.530,00:14:14.753,Xiao-Yunzi.
00:14:18.240,00:14:19.830,我让小允子先送你回去,00:14:14.753,00:14:15.659,Yes.
00:14:20.520,00:14:22.630,今儿你也吓着了先好好歇息,00:14:19.480,00:14:21.563,Xiao-Yunzi will walk you to your palace.
00:14:23.400,00:14:25.230,等明儿我和眉姐姐商量了,00:14:21.640,00:14:24.192,You had a fright tonight. Go have a good rest.
00:14:25.640,00:14:27.190,再请她出面请示皇后,00:14:24.531,00:14:28.480,"I will talk to Meizhuang tomorrow.
She'll seek instructions from Her Majesty."
00:14:29.320,00:14:29.990,小允子,,,
00:14:30.160,00:14:30.750,在,,,
00:14:31.120,00:14:31.790,送淳常在回去,00:14:30.491,00:14:31.711,"Xiao-Yunzi,"
00:14:32.040,00:14:32.670,嗻,00:14:31.975,00:14:33.632,walk Attendant Chun back.
00:14:44.760,00:14:45.710,真是可怜她,00:14:45.996,00:14:47.175,How pitiful.
00:14:46.280,00:14:49.150,小小年纪要在宫中受这等惊吓,00:14:47.477,00:14:50.871,"At such a young age, she has to live in fear."
00:14:50.040,00:14:51.260,好歹是两位常在,,,
00:14:51.720,00:14:53.830,竟然被一个答应欺负成这个样子,00:14:51.173,00:14:55.010,How can a Companion bully two Attendants so badly?
00:14:55.520,00:14:57.350,在宫中没有恩宠真是可怜,00:14:56.714,00:14:59.225,"What a miserable life
to live in the palace without His Majesty's favor."
00:14:58.920,00:15:00.990,余氏恃宠而骄 夜半高歌,,,
00:15:01.840,00:15:02.550,还私自下令,00:15:00.231,00:15:03.023,Yu grows conceited over her favors and sings loudly at night.
00:15:02.920,00:15:04.470,把欣常在关去慎刑司,00:15:03.023,00:15:05.815,And even gave the private order to detain Attendant Joie.
00:15:05.400,00:15:08.150,依我看倒是好事,00:15:06.613,00:15:09.618,This might turn out to be a good thing.
00:15:09.200,00:15:09.950,好事,,,
00:15:10.360,00:15:11.190,可不是吗,00:15:10.000,00:15:11.456,A good thing?
00:15:11.800,00:15:12.780,她骤然受宠,,,
00:15:13.280,00:15:14.870,已经让很多嫔妃不满了,00:15:11.456,00:15:15.876,Indeed. Her sudden advancement has displeased many.
00:15:15.160,00:15:16.220,如此又这样不检点,,,
00:15:17.040,00:15:18.470,这不是自寻死路吗,00:15:16.140,00:15:19.740,"She will only dig her own grave
with her reckless behavior."
00:15:23.880,00:15:26.260,整个宫里也就你还乐得自在,00:15:24.964,00:15:27.500,You are the only calm person here now.
00:15:26.680,00:15:28.110,外面可要闹翻天了,,,
00:15:28.640,00:15:29.430,怎么了,00:15:27.600,00:15:29.814,The uproar in the palace can almost reach Heaven.
00:15:30.560,00:15:31.830,太后下了懿旨,00:15:29.814,00:15:30.834,What happened?
00:15:32.120,00:15:34.350,放欣常在出慎刑司加以抚慰,00:15:31.794,00:15:35.420,"The Empress Dowager made an edict
to release Attendant Joie and offer consolations;"
00:15:34.640,00:15:37.020,并褫夺余答应妙音娘子的封号,,,
00:15:37.320,00:15:38.830,罚她闭门思过半月,00:15:35.609,00:15:40.100,"Companion Yu is deprived of her honorary alias
and will be confined for half a month."
00:15:39.520,00:15:40.550,是太后的懿旨,,,
00:15:40.920,00:15:41.430,是啊,00:15:40.553,00:15:41.980, The Empress Dowager?
00:15:42.280,00:15:44.190,怎么皇上皇后没有发话,00:15:41.980,00:15:42.914,Yes.
00:15:44.600,00:15:45.820,竟是太后的懿旨,00:15:43.329,00:15:47.080,Why haven't the Emperor and the Empress said anything?
00:15:46.080,00:15:48.750,皇上忙于政务 不理会这种小事,00:15:47.231,00:15:50.080,"His Majesty doesn't concern himself with
such a trivial matter before the state affairs."
00:15:49.120,00:15:51.030,正好皇后在太后的宫里,,,
00:15:51.320,00:15:52.830,所以太后就知道了,00:15:50.189,00:15:54.080,The Empress was visiting the Empress Dowager and informed her.
00:15:53.280,00:15:54.550,太后宽严并济,,,
00:15:54.920,00:15:56.270,也算是小惩大戒吧,00:15:54.269,00:15:57.760,"Her Majesty tempers justice with mercy.
A small punishment will teach a greater lesson."
00:15:56.520,00:15:59.230,是啊 余氏虽还是答应,,,
00:15:59.560,00:16:00.910,但失了这个封号,00:15:57.760,00:16:04.107,"Yes. While Yu is still ranked at Companion,
losing her alias will affect her status."
00:16:01.320,00:16:03.150,地位已是大不如前了,,,
00:16:17.720,00:16:19.670,今天的字写得很顺手啊,00:16:17.774,00:16:19.017,(pleasant)
00:16:20.920,00:16:21.900,把它存起来吧,00:16:19.017,00:16:21.063,The writing went smoothly today.
00:16:22.080,00:16:22.790,是,00:16:21.930,00:16:23.221,I'll keep this one.
00:16:24.960,00:16:27.420,余氏受了责罚 也算安分了,00:16:23.221,00:16:24.014,Yes.
00:16:28.080,00:16:29.870,娘娘连练字都练得顺畅,00:16:26.600,00:16:31.000,"Now that Yu is subdued by her punishment,
Your Majesty can write in peace."
00:16:30.600,00:16:32.390,太后果然是最心疼娘娘的,,,
00:16:32.880,00:16:34.670,余答应正是得宠的时候,00:16:31.839,00:16:33.875,The Empress Dowager is very thoughtful towards Your Majesty.
00:16:35.160,00:16:36.950,若本宫这时责罚她,00:16:34.026,00:16:36.179,Companion Yu is in high favor at the moment.
00:16:37.400,00:16:39.430,难保皇上不开口求情,00:16:36.391,00:16:40.589,"If I were to punish her,
His Majesty would much likely intercede."
00:16:40.480,00:16:42.860,与其到时候在皇上情面,,,
00:16:43.160,00:16:45.590,和皇后尊严之间做权衡,00:16:41.703,00:16:46.682,"Rather than weighing His Majesty's feelings against my dignity,"
00:16:45.920,00:16:49.700,还不如太后出面心服口服,00:16:46.984,00:16:51.200,"involving the Empress Dowager can
convince people's mouths and minds."
00:16:50.480,00:16:51.350,娘娘英明,00:16:51.282,00:16:52.973,Your Majesty is wise.
00:16:55.400,00:16:56.590,这一向时气好,,,
00:16:56.960,00:16:58.550,小主又不大吃那药了,00:16:56.585,00:16:59.709,"The weather has been more pleasant
and you started to take the medicine less."
00:16:58.960,00:17:00.550,看着身子也松泛了许多,00:17:00.000,00:17:01.946,You're looking more at ease.
00:17:02.280,00:17:03.500,一向太平无事,,,
00:17:04.400,00:17:05.510,不吃那药也无妨,00:17:03.364,00:17:07.152,"If things go peacefully, I don't have to take the medicine."
00:17:06.240,00:17:08.030,小主一直拖着这病不肯好,,,
00:17:08.400,00:17:09.350,如今既停了药,,,
00:17:09.760,00:17:11.430,也该到太阳底下多走走,00:17:07.416,00:17:12.478,"Since you are feeling better in your prolonged recovery,
you should go outside more and get some sunlight."
00:17:11.720,00:17:13.750,这样也能显得气色好些,00:17:12.704,00:17:15.123,It'll also make you look healthier.
00:17:14.400,00:17:15.620,小主前些日子说,,,
00:17:15.840,00:17:18.030,想要在碎玉轩附近的御花园里面,00:17:15.651,00:17:20.320,"You said you wanted to have a swing
put up in the garden outside our palace."
00:17:18.440,00:17:19.190,扎一个秋千,,,
00:17:19.520,00:17:20.790,小允子已经扎好了,,,
00:17:21.440,00:17:22.790,那个地方都是杏花,00:17:20.546,00:17:22.400,Xiao-Yunzi has built one.
00:17:23.200,00:17:24.180,小主可去瞧瞧,00:17:22.540,00:17:25.451,"It is surrounded by apricot flowers.
Would you like to go see it?"
00:17:26.520,00:17:29.790,杏花疏影里 吹笛到天明,00:17:27.734,00:17:31.602,"""In the dappled shade of apricot flowers,
I play the flute till the first light appears."""
00:17:31.600,00:17:34.430,你们俩是变着法地要让我出去,00:17:33.060,00:17:36.120,You two are trying every trick to get me out the door.
00:17:35.960,00:17:36.830,那我便去吧,,,
00:17:38.120,00:17:38.990,流朱,00:17:37.360,00:17:38.400,I'll go then.
00:17:39.320,00:17:40.190,取我的箫来,00:17:39.620,00:17:41.434,"Vermilion, get me my flute."
00:17:40.480,00:17:41.230,快去呀,00:17:41.434,00:17:42.340,Go quickly.

,,,00:19:19.760,00:19:20.888,Hmm?
00:19:22.440,00:19:23.230,你猜猜,00:19:23.680,00:19:24.867,Can you guess?
00:19:26.840,00:19:28.060,你不会是皇上吧,00:19:27.743,00:19:29.592,You can't be... the Emperor?
00:19:32.440,00:19:33.270,您是王爷,00:19:33.474,00:19:34.854,You are a prince?
00:19:36.520,00:19:38.470,听说过果郡王吗,00:19:37.900,00:19:40.000,Have you heard of Noble Prince Guo?
00:19:39.840,00:19:41.230,尊驾真的是果郡王,00:19:40.884,00:19:42.734,Are you really Noble Prince Guo?
00:19:43.400,00:19:46.630,你见过我,00:19:44.501,00:19:48.101,Have you ever seen... me?
00:19:49.600,00:19:52.470,自入宫 连皇上都未见过,00:19:50.666,00:19:54.145,"No, I have not even seen His Majesty
since I entered the palace."
00:19:59.600,00:20:03.140,那你怎么知道我不是果郡王呢,00:20:00.547,00:20:04.311,So why do you think that I'm not Noble Prince Guo?
00:20:06.560,00:20:07.950,似乎年岁不大对,,,
00:20:08.560,00:20:10.590,人的年岁和他的相貌,00:20:07.538,00:20:09.318,The age is not matching ...
00:20:10.920,00:20:12.670,往往是不太相符的,00:20:09.620,00:20:13.716,A man doesn't always look his age.
00:20:14.440,00:20:16.230,尊驾要是果郡王便是吧,00:20:15.680,00:20:17.383,If Your Excellency says so...

Peace to Your Lordship."
00:20:21.080,00:20:23.380,你就是那个抱病的常在,00:20:22.180,00:20:24.680,You are the Attendant who has long been sick?
00:20:24.920,00:20:27.480,内宫琐事 王爷如何知晓,00:20:25.920,00:20:28.943,How does Your Lordship know such a trifling detail of the harem?
00:20:28.360,00:20:32.270,我是听皇嫂说起的,00:20:29.546,00:20:33.599,I heard it from... the Empress.
00:20:33.600,00:20:34.580,除夕的时候,,,
00:20:35.360,00:20:38.510,皇兄问了一句 我正好在,00:20:34.579,00:20:37.998,My Imperial Brother asked about you at the New Year banquet.
,,,00:20:38.376,00:20:40.000,I overheard it.
00:20:40.080,00:20:40.990,原来如此,00:20:41.260,00:20:42.465,I see.
00:20:42.360,00:20:43.750,身子可好些了吗,00:20:43.333,00:20:45.126,Has your health improved?
00:20:45.160,00:20:47.590,出来怎么不多穿件衣裳,00:20:46.240,00:20:48.816,You should have put on a cloak before coming outdoors.
00:20:48.240,00:20:49.220,王爷关怀,00:20:49.080,00:20:50.960,I thank Your Lordship for the caring words.
00:20:51.640,00:20:52.830,妾身已好多了,00:20:52.205,00:20:54.320,I've been feeling much better.
00:20:54.240,00:20:55.910,流朱这是果郡王,00:20:55.225,00:20:57.606,"Vermilion, this is Noble Prince Guo."
00:20:59.400,00:21:00.790,果郡王万福,00:21:00.504,00:21:02.220,Peace to Your Lordship.
00:21:02.600,00:21:05.110,你刚才吹的那首 杏花天影,,,
00:21:05.840,00:21:06.980,合情合景,00:21:03.465,00:21:08.380,"I heard you playing ""Flying Shadows of Apricot Petals"".
It is befitting the garden scene."
00:21:07.560,00:21:09.830,王爷对这曲谱很熟吗,00:21:08.569,00:21:11.056,Is Your Lordship familiar with the song?
00:21:10.840,00:21:14.150,若是在春夜用埙吹奏,,,
00:21:15.120,00:21:18.900,会更得其清丽幽婉之妙,00:21:11.698,00:21:20.800,"If played with a vessel flute on a spring night,
the song's melodious sorrow would be beautifully rendered."
00:21:20.240,00:21:21.870,此刻用箫吹奏,,,
00:21:22.720,00:21:24.350,减轻了曲中的愁意,00:21:21.479,00:21:25.677,"The xiao flute lessens the melancholy of the song,"
00:21:25.280,00:21:29.590,倒多了几分回雪吹风之爽朗,00:21:26.356,00:21:30.791,"and adds a touch of clarity
like a refreshing breeze on the snow."
00:21:31.000,00:21:34.230,妾身献丑还请王爷莫要怪罪,00:21:32.040,00:21:35.136,"My instrument was inadequate.

00:21:37.280,00:21:38.950,只是刚才吹到那句,00:21:37.677,00:21:40.120,But when you were playing the line
00:21:39.720,00:21:42.510,满汀芳草不成归的时候,00:21:40.120,00:21:44.393,"""Fragrant spring grass carpeting the riverbank,
no further can I approach to home."""
00:21:43.760,00:21:45.670,箫声微有凝滞,00:21:44.914,00:21:47.157,"The music sounded stifled,"
00:21:47.000,00:21:48.550,带有呜咽之感,00:21:47.911,00:21:50.302,as if there was a sob in your breath.
00:21:49.920,00:21:50.900,可是想家了吗,00:21:50.819,00:21:52.427,Do you miss home?

00:22:02.600,00:22:07.030,本王也是许久没有听到,00:22:03.638,00:22:05.681,It's been a long time
00:22:07.400,00:22:08.510,这样好的箫声了,00:22:06.511,00:22:09.623,since I heard such beautiful playing of the flute.
00:22:10.520,00:22:15.190,自从纯元皇后去世后,00:22:11.472,00:22:16.522,"Since... Empress Première passed away,"
00:22:16.040,00:22:17.670,再没有这样好的箫声了,00:22:17.050,00:22:19.050,such music has been rare.
00:22:18.160,00:22:20.460,王爷赞许 妾身不敢承受,00:22:19.200,00:22:21.781,I don't deserve Your Lordship's flattery.
00:22:21.800,00:22:23.550,妾身不敢与纯元皇后相比,00:22:22.837,00:22:25.422,I dare not compare myself to Empress Première.
00:22:26.960,00:22:28.230,妾身先行回宫了,00:22:28.000,00:22:30.000,I should go back to my palace now.
00:22:29.520,00:22:30.310,王爷请自便,,,

00:22:57.720,00:22:59.190,你去宫里头打听一下,00:22:56.510,00:22:57.810,Violet.
00:22:59.560,00:23:01.030,今日果郡王进宫了没有,00:22:58.954,00:23:02.120,"Can you ask around and find out
if Noble Prince Guo came to the palace today?"
00:23:01.960,00:23:02.590,是,00:23:02.828,00:23:04.036,Yes.
00:23:04.840,00:23:05.670,小主以为,,,
00:23:05.920,00:23:07.830,刚才与您品箫的不是果郡王啊,00:23:06.080,00:23:09.240,Do you not believe he is Noble Prince Guo?
00:23:10.360,00:23:11.150,你说呢,00:23:11.226,00:23:12.547,What do you think?
00:23:13.760,00:23:15.110,多小心几分总是好的,00:23:14.679,00:23:16.600,We can never be too careful.
00:23:21.240,00:23:22.070,皇上吉祥,,,
00:23:23.000,00:23:23.790,起来吧,00:23:22.000,00:23:23.549,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:23:24.040,00:23:24.590,谢皇上,,,
00:23:24.880,00:23:26.390,你怎么那么早就来了,00:23:23.926,00:23:25.721,"- Rise.
- I thank Your Majesty."
00:23:26.840,00:23:28.190,皇兄一早派人来传旨,00:23:25.721,00:23:27.441,Why are you here so early?
00:23:28.520,00:23:29.710,说有吴道子的真迹,00:23:27.780,00:23:30.880,"Your Majesty sent me the news that
you got an original painting by Wu Daozi."
00:23:30.120,00:23:31.070,我这心痒难耐,,,
00:23:31.560,00:23:32.510,即刻就跑来了,00:23:31.107,00:23:33.947,"My heart was itching for it,
so I hurried my way here."
00:23:33.920,00:23:36.270,急什么 画又不会跑,00:23:34.976,00:23:37.323,Why? The painting won't run off.
00:23:36.720,00:23:38.430,这名画啊 跟美人是一样的,,,
00:23:38.800,00:23:39.710,一刻也不能迟,00:23:38.000,00:23:39.820,A famous painting is like a beautiful woman.
00:23:40.080,00:23:42.310,如此急色 倒未见你娶亲,00:23:39.820,00:23:41.120,You can't afford a moment of delay.
00:23:43.440,00:23:45.110,臣弟本来是想娶亲来着,00:23:41.120,00:23:43.580,"But you are never so eager
when it comes to women."
00:23:45.440,00:23:46.830,可是刚刚在这大殿门口,00:23:44.520,00:23:46.307,I did think about getting married.
00:23:47.200,00:23:49.190,看见这美人梨花带雨,00:23:46.496,00:23:49.214,But I changed my mind outside your palace
00:23:49.520,00:23:50.830,就把这念头给吓回去了,00:23:49.214,00:23:51.886,when I saw a lady crying like the pear blossoms in the rain.
00:23:52.160,00:23:53.350,苏培盛 皇上,,,
00:23:54.120,00:23:55.260,余氏来过了,00:23:53.500,00:23:54.978,"- Su Peisheng.
- Your Majesty."
00:23:55.480,00:23:57.550,回皇上 余答应一早就来,00:23:55.280,00:23:56.580,Was Yu here?
00:23:58.000,00:23:59.350,哭着要求见皇上,00:23:56.580,00:23:59.080,"Yes, Companion Yu came here very early this morning."
00:23:59.760,00:24:01.270,奴才回禀说皇上不在,00:23:59.120,00:24:00.960,"She was in tears
and urging to see Your Majesty."
00:24:01.640,00:24:03.430,她又哭了好一会儿才回去,00:24:00.960,00:24:04.446,"I said Your Majesty was not here.
And she kept crying for quite a while before leaving."
00:24:03.920,00:24:04.710,不必理她,,,
00:24:05.000,00:24:05.670,嗻,00:24:04.937,00:24:06.082,Ignore her.
00:24:06.080,00:24:06.830,对了,00:24:06.082,00:24:07.080,Aye.
00:24:07.320,00:24:09.950,朕记得有一把极好的蓝田玉箫,00:24:07.274,00:24:11.009,I remember that I had a xiao flute made of Lantian Jade.
00:24:10.320,00:24:11.070,你去给朕找出来,,,
00:24:11.360,00:24:12.110,嗻,00:24:11.201,00:24:12.433,Go find it for me.
00:24:13.280,00:24:14.190,皇兄去哪儿了,00:24:12.433,00:24:13.061,Aye.
00:24:15.080,00:24:17.030,朕去给皇额娘请安,00:24:13.700,00:24:15.656,Where did Your Majesty go just now?
,,,00:24:15.920,00:24:18.520,I was paying respects to Imperial Mother.
00:24:17.600,00:24:20.310,经过御花园 一个人走走,00:24:18.620,00:24:21.820,And I took a walk by myself in the garden.
00:24:21.760,00:24:24.270,倒累了你在这儿听女人哭,00:24:23.000,00:24:25.540,So you had to hear her crying here in my stead.
00:24:24.760,00:24:26.230,倚梅园一遇倾心,,,
00:24:26.520,00:24:28.710,皇兄对这位余氏可还满意呀,00:24:25.766,00:24:29.920,"How does Your Majesty like the lady
from the delightful encounter amidst the leaning plum trees?"
00:24:29.040,00:24:30.020,也就这样,,,
00:24:30.640,00:24:31.620,倒不如那一晚,00:24:29.960,00:24:31.286,Not that much.
00:24:32.000,00:24:34.230,在倚梅园温婉动心了,00:24:31.663,00:24:35.364,Not as appealing as the night of the encounter.
00:24:34.480,00:24:37.470,所以呀 相见不如怀念,00:24:35.440,00:24:38.977,What the mind's eye sees is always better than the eyes.
00:24:39.360,00:24:41.270,来 看画,00:24:41.160,00:24:43.040,Let's go see the painting.
00:24:47.160,00:24:49.720,回小主的话 果郡王今日入宫了,00:24:48.292,00:24:51.010,"My Lady, Noble Prince Guo is in the palace today."
00:24:50.000,00:24:52.030,现下在养心殿正与皇上品画呢,00:24:51.010,00:24:53.759,He is viewing paintings with His Majesty.
00:24:54.800,00:24:56.790,听说果郡王看上去很稳重,00:24:54.960,00:24:59.280,"I hear that Noble Prince Guo carries an air of sophistication.
Is he around forty years old?"
00:24:57.280,00:24:58.190,将近四十了,,,
00:24:58.400,00:24:59.070,哪儿啊,,,
00:24:59.360,00:25:01.310,果郡王是康熙三＋五年生的,00:24:59.280,00:25:00.195,How could he be?
00:25:01.640,00:25:03.070,今年左不过二＋五六,00:25:00.195,00:25:04.120,"He was born in the 35th Year of Kangxi Reign.
He's twenty-five or twenty-six this year."
00:25:03.640,00:25:05.670,要说起四＋多岁的亲王,,,
00:25:06.120,00:25:07.470,那便是恒亲王了,00:25:04.614,00:25:08.394,State Prince Heng is a prince in his forties.
00:25:07.840,00:25:08.750,他人也随和,,,
00:25:09.080,00:25:10.790,爱和咱们宫人们说说笑笑的,00:25:08.620,00:25:11.960,He is easygoing and likes to banter with us.
00:25:11.880,00:25:12.630,那皇上呢,,,
00:25:13.320,00:25:14.630,那奴婢就不知道了,00:25:12.714,00:25:14.164,What about His Majesty the Emperor?
00:25:15.480,00:25:16.750,皇上不常来后宫,00:25:14.280,00:25:15.800,I have no idea.
00:25:17.200,00:25:19.230,来了也是乌泱泱一堆人围着,00:25:16.366,00:25:18.090,"His Majesty doesn't come  to the harem a lot,"
,,,00:25:18.279,00:25:20.598,and he's always followed by a mass of servants.
00:25:19.840,00:25:22.630,奴婢身份低微 是见不着皇上的,00:25:20.824,00:25:23.701,I am too humble to see His Majesty.
00:25:23.320,00:25:25.750,也是 皇上走到哪儿,00:25:24.040,00:25:25.567,That's true.
00:25:26.240,00:25:27.630,身后都跟着一群人,00:25:25.982,00:25:28.991,His Majesty is always followed by a crowd of servants.
00:25:29.600,00:25:31.310,你去吧 我也乏了,00:25:30.560,00:25:32.849,You can go. I will have a rest.
00:25:32.160,00:25:32.870,是,,,
00:25:33.800,00:25:36.510,妹妹的遭遇 本宫很是同情,00:25:35.500,00:25:38.061,I'm sympathetic to what happened to you.
00:25:37.520,00:25:39.710,可这件事原是太后的旨意,,,
00:25:40.320,00:25:41.870,皇上也奈何不得,00:25:38.400,00:25:43.083,"But there's nothing His Majesty can do
about the Empress Dowager's edict."
00:25:43.000,00:25:44.790,嫔妾自幼在宫中伺候,,,
00:25:45.120,00:25:47.190,早就知道太后是最好的性子,00:25:43.875,00:25:46.183,I have served in the palace since childhood.
00:25:47.840,00:25:49.110,凡事从不过问,00:25:46.183,00:25:49.978,"I know Her Majesty has a kind temperament,
and never oversees the matters in the harem."
00:25:49.680,00:25:52.350,可偏偏嫔妾一时不稳,,,
00:25:52.640,00:25:54.150,就被太后抓着不放,00:25:50.884,00:25:55.134,"But when I stumbled this time,
Her Majesty went very strict on me."
00:25:54.840,00:25:57.190,想必定是有人挑唆的,00:25:55.889,00:25:58.783,Someone else must be fanning the flames.
00:25:57.840,00:26:01.110,有人挑唆也好 太后真生气也罢,00:25:58.971,00:26:02.380,"Whether it was Her Majesty's decision or not,"
00:26:02.080,00:26:05.030,好在这半个月的禁足已经过了,00:26:02.946,00:26:06.293,your half-month confinement has passed.
00:26:05.760,00:26:07.630,太后也不能再说什么,00:26:06.746,00:26:08.858,There's nothing else Her Majesty can say.
00:26:08.080,00:26:11.620,可是 可是皇上还是不肯见嫔妾,00:26:09.160,00:26:12.931,But... But His Majesty is still not willing to see me.
00:26:13.760,00:26:17.150,也是啊 如果长此下去,00:26:14.928,00:26:16.410,That's true.
00:26:17.520,00:26:19.790,皇上恐怕要忘了妹妹这个人,00:26:16.410,00:26:20.741,I'm afraid His Majesty will forget about you if this continues.
00:26:25.080,00:26:27.030,娘娘 救救嫔妾吧,00:26:26.000,00:26:28.280,"Your Highness, please help me!"
00:26:27.320,00:26:28.830,嫔妾不想被冷落深宫,,,
00:26:29.200,00:26:31.660,不想再被送到倚梅园被人差遣了,00:26:28.340,00:26:32.811,"I don't want to be abandoned
or sent back to work in the garden."
00:26:32.240,00:26:33.070,娘娘,00:26:33.226,00:26:34.400,Your Highness.
00:26:35.000,00:26:37.910,也是 既然妹妹要见的是皇上,,,
00:26:38.320,00:26:39.540,皇上如果不见,00:26:37.040,00:26:39.180,"Since you want to see His Majesty,"
00:26:39.920,00:26:41.750,那妹妹自当另下功夫,00:26:39.200,00:26:42.560,you put in the effort to make him see you.
00:26:42.360,00:26:44.230,见面三分情,00:26:43.314,00:26:45.951,"""A request made in person is hard to turn down."""
00:26:44.880,00:26:47.030,皇上不会不顾惜妹妹的,00:26:45.951,00:26:48.299,His Majesty will show pity towards you.
00:26:47.600,00:26:51.110,可是可是嫔妾不知道该怎么做,00:26:48.629,00:26:52.480,But ... But I don't know what to do.
00:26:51.720,00:26:55.870,妹妹擅长做什么 就放手去做,00:26:52.744,00:26:57.014,"Whatever you are good at, do it."
00:27:02.000,00:27:03.270,多谢娘娘指点,00:27:03.120,00:27:05.000,I thank Your Highness for your advice.
00:27:03.920,00:27:06.510,颂芝 送余答应出去,00:27:05.060,00:27:07.840,"Songzhi, walk Companion Yu out."
00:27:06.800,00:27:08.950,是 余答应请,00:27:07.960,00:27:08.758,Yes.
00:27:14.360,00:27:15.070,娘娘,00:27:09.000,00:27:10.260,"My Lady, please."
00:27:15.440,00:27:17.670,这余答应前些日子得宠不少,00:27:16.279,00:27:18.980,Companion Yu received a lot of favor before.
00:27:18.200,00:27:20.430,这少了她 还少了个争宠的人,00:27:19.319,00:27:22.058,"Without her, one fewer person is competing for favor."
00:27:21.000,00:27:23.710,娘娘为何还要教她呢,00:27:22.058,00:27:24.737,Why would Your Highness help her?
00:27:24.400,00:27:27.910,是太后责罚她 又不是皇上责罚,00:27:25.580,00:27:29.143,"It was the Empress Dowager who punished her, not His Majesty."
00:27:28.560,00:27:30.750,倘若哪日皇上自己想起她来,00:27:29.640,00:27:32.121,"If one day His Majesty remembers her,"
00:27:31.640,00:27:33.430,倒不如本宫教她个乖,00:27:32.121,00:27:34.720,I will have earned her gratitude.
00:27:34.320,00:27:36.590,好让她死心塌地地跟着本宫,,,
00:27:37.480,00:27:39.670,替本宫分掉沈贵人的恩宠,00:27:35.550,00:27:40.601,"So she will follow me wholeheartedly
and take away Lady Shen's share of favor."
00:27:40.120,00:27:42.630,娘娘 这沈贵人刚进宫,,,
00:27:43.080,00:27:44.190,根基还未稳,00:27:41.280,00:27:45.311,"Your Highness, Lady Shen is new
and her position is not securely rooted."
00:27:45.040,00:27:48.350,娘娘 不必太介意吧,00:27:45.953,00:27:49.561,Why would you pay so much attention her?
00:27:48.800,00:27:50.070,她是刚进宫,00:27:49.787,00:27:51.599,She is new.
00:27:51.240,00:27:53.620,可这刚进宫就能让皇上许她,,,
00:27:54.040,00:27:55.350,学习六宫事宜,00:27:52.391,00:27:56.406,"But she was allowed to learn about
palace management so soon."
00:27:56.480,00:27:58.590,这才是本宫最担忧的,00:27:57.580,00:28:00.000,That is my greatest concern.
00:28:14.000,00:28:16.710,停 你们先回养心殿,00:28:15.190,00:28:17.670,Stop. You all go on without me.
00:28:17.280,00:28:18.340,朕自己走走,,,
00:28:18.760,00:28:21.220,皇上 太后才交代过奴才,00:28:18.160,00:28:19.900,I'd like to take a walk alone.
00:28:21.560,00:28:22.700,要小心伺候,00:28:19.900,00:28:23.654,But the Empress Dowager just told me to look after Your Majesty.
00:28:23.000,00:28:24.350,奴才要不跟着伺候,,,
00:28:24.680,00:28:26.590,那不是自个儿找死吗,00:28:23.880,00:28:27.574,"If I didn't accompany Your Majesty,
I would be granted death."
00:28:26.880,00:28:28.270,你现在就是在找死,00:28:27.800,00:28:29.640,I can grant you death right now.
00:28:30.520,00:28:31.190,落轿,00:28:31.460,00:28:32.720,Lower the sedan.
00:28:38.480,00:28:40.070,不许跟任何人提起,,,
00:28:40.360,00:28:41.070,嗻,00:28:39.435,00:28:41.436,Don't say a word to anyone.
00:28:42.680,00:28:43.310,起,00:28:41.436,00:28:42.200,Aye.
00:28:45.600,00:28:46.470,还要再高点吗,00:28:44.000,00:28:45.200,Proceed.
00:28:48.000,00:28:48.710,一点点,00:28:47.000,00:28:48.457,Do you want to go higher?
00:28:49.760,00:28:51.070,我就知道小主会怕,00:28:49.000,00:28:50.400,Just a bit.
,,,00:28:50.724,00:28:52.760,I know you'd be afraid.
00:28:56.560,00:28:57.510,一会儿我来推你,00:28:57.274,00:28:58.980,It'll be my turn to push later.
00:28:58.040,00:29:00.230,好啊 我可是什么都不怕的,00:28:58.980,00:29:01.440,"Sure, I'm not afraid of heights."
00:29:15.000,00:29:17.230,好啊 流朱 竟敢在我背后使坏,00:29:15.659,00:29:18.740,"Vermilion, you're playing tricks behind my back."
00:29:19.520,00:29:20.270,王爷,00:29:20.459,00:29:21.620,Your Lordship!
00:29:20.960,00:29:22.390,若害怕 就下来,00:29:21.959,00:29:23.640,Get down if you're scared.
00:29:23.960,00:29:26.470,我不怕 王爷只管推就是了,00:29:25.140,00:29:27.680,I'm not scared. Your Lordship can keep pushing.
00:29:30.560,00:29:31.070,再高点,00:29:31.500,00:29:32.689,A bit higher.
00:29:34.920,00:29:35.590,再高点,00:29:35.940,00:29:37.029,And higher.
00:30:05.440,00:30:06.150,小主,,,
00:30:07.160,00:30:07.950,见过王爷,00:30:06.521,00:30:07.563,My Lady.
00:30:09.160,00:30:10.070,没事吧 小主,00:30:08.378,00:30:10.000,Greetings to Your Lordship.
00:30:12.280,00:30:13.550,现在怎么害羞了,00:30:10.236,00:30:11.756,"My Lady, are you all right?"
00:30:14.280,00:30:16.270,刚才不是还女中豪杰一般吗,00:30:13.218,00:30:15.040,Why so shy?
00:30:17.040,00:30:17.910,妾身失仪,00:30:15.199,00:30:17.394,You were acting heroic just now.
00:30:18.400,00:30:19.380,妾身并不知王爷,00:30:17.960,00:30:19.580,I apologize for my manners.
00:30:19.600,00:30:21.190,喜欢悄无声息站在人后,00:30:19.580,00:30:22.169,I didn't know Your Lordship would sneak behind my back.
00:30:22.680,00:30:25.060,是怪本王无礼了,00:30:24.180,00:30:26.420,Are you blaming my manners now?
00:30:26.200,00:30:27.750,本是无意中经过这里,00:30:27.159,00:30:28.895,I was passing by the garden.
00:30:29.160,00:30:31.510,想起那一日常在的箫声,,,
00:30:32.040,00:30:34.950,希望能遇见小主 再聆听一番,00:30:30.140,00:30:36.460,"It reminded me of your music
and I was hoping to hear your flute playing again, My Lady."
00:30:36.360,00:30:38.990,可是今日妾身并没有带箫,00:30:37.540,00:30:40.291,"But today, I do not have the flute with me."
00:30:40.520,00:30:41.740,那只好等下一次了,00:30:41.676,00:30:43.360,I'll have to wait until the next time.
00:30:52.840,00:30:54.060,这儿都是杏花,00:30:53.982,00:30:55.621,There are many apricot flowers here.
00:30:55.880,00:30:58.870,你上次吹的曲子也和杏花有关,00:30:57.220,00:31:00.260,The song you played is also about apricot flowers.
00:30:59.560,00:31:01.030,你是很喜欢杏花吗,00:31:00.524,00:31:02.538,Is it because you like apricot flowers?
00:31:02.040,00:31:04.670,杏花不似桃花艳丽,,,
00:31:05.280,00:31:06.550,又不似寒梅清冷,00:31:02.840,00:31:07.738,"Apricot flowers are not as bright as peach flowers,
or cold as plum blossoms."
00:31:07.520,00:31:08.910,格外温润和婉,00:31:08.530,00:31:10.630,They are modest and gentle.
00:31:09.960,00:31:13.110,人如花 花亦如人,00:31:11.120,00:31:14.267,People and flowers are alike.
00:31:14.440,00:31:17.030,只有品性和婉的人,,,
00:31:17.360,00:31:19.950,才会喜欢品性和婉的花,00:31:15.324,00:31:21.400,"Only a modest and gentle person
can be attracted to modest and gentle flowers."
00:31:20.720,00:31:22.510,可妾身并不敢喜欢杏花,00:31:21.746,00:31:24.320,But I don't really like apricot flowers.
00:31:24.400,00:31:25.310,说来听听,00:31:25.339,00:31:26.640,Why is that?
00:31:25.920,00:31:29.390,杏花虽美 可结出的果子极酸,00:31:26.866,00:31:32.226,"Despite the beautiful flowers,
the apricot fruit is sour and the seeds are bitter."
00:31:29.680,00:31:30.870,杏仁更是苦涩,,,
00:31:31.560,00:31:33.550,若做人做事皆是开头美好,,,
00:31:33.880,00:31:34.670,而结局潦倒,,,
00:31:35.040,00:31:35.910,又有何意义,00:31:32.731,00:31:36.991,"Isn't it meaningless if one's life
starts beautifully but ends in the opposite?"
00:31:37.160,00:31:38.300,倒不如像松柏,,,
00:31:38.920,00:31:41.350,终年青翠 无花无果也就罢了,00:31:38.226,00:31:40.176,"I'd rather be the pine and cypress,"
00:31:42.240,00:31:43.910,从未听过这样的见解,00:31:40.176,00:31:42.974,"living an evergreen life
without producing flowers and fruits."
00:31:44.240,00:31:45.710,倒是新鲜别致,00:31:43.351,00:31:46.720,"I've never heard of such a perspective.
It's unique and novel."
00:31:47.680,00:31:50.190,妾身胡言乱语 让王爷见笑了,00:31:48.780,00:31:51.520,I hope I did not incur Your Lordship's ridicule.
00:31:51.640,00:31:55.070,今日是本王唐突,00:31:52.800,00:31:55.911,My manners were abrupt today.
00:31:57.280,00:31:58.750,我有两套曲谱,,,
00:31:59.640,00:32:01.630,五日后同一时辰,00:31:58.210,00:32:00.182,I have two flute scores.
00:32:02.000,00:32:04.030,拿来与你一同鉴赏,00:32:00.559,00:32:05.196,"I'll bring them here for your entertainment
at the same hour in five days' time."
00:32:04.840,00:32:07.140,还望常在一定要来,00:32:05.837,00:32:08.480,"I hope you will be here, My Lady."
00:32:09.840,00:32:11.110,那恭敬不如从命,00:32:10.826,00:32:12.796,I am honored to obey.
00:32:23.720,00:32:26.630,妾身有一事相求 请王爷应允,00:32:25.080,00:32:27.934,May I trouble Your Lordship for a favor?
00:32:27.040,00:32:27.750,你说,00:32:27.934,00:32:29.027,Go ahead.
00:32:30.000,00:32:32.230,妾身与王爷相见已属不妥,00:32:30.910,00:32:33.470,It is inappropriate for me to meet Your Lordship privately.
00:32:32.720,00:32:35.180,还请王爷不要让旁人知晓,,,
00:32:35.600,00:32:36.820,以免坏了各自清誉,00:32:33.734,00:32:37.894,"I hope no one else will know
lest our good name be stained."
00:32:37.280,00:32:40.110,既是清誉又有谁能坏得了呢,00:32:38.400,00:32:41.241,"Since it's a good name,
who could damage it?"
00:32:40.680,00:32:41.790,王爷有所不知,,,
00:32:43.000,00:32:44.790,妾身与王爷光明磊落,00:32:41.580,00:32:43.300,Your Lordship might not know...
00:32:45.520,00:32:47.390,可后宫之内人多口杂,00:32:43.828,00:32:48.696,"Although we meet in an aboveboard manner,
many mouths spread gossip in the harem."
00:32:48.160,00:32:49.630,妾身不想徒惹是非,00:32:49.035,00:32:50.880,I do not want to stir up any trouble.
00:32:50.760,00:32:51.510,好吧,00:32:51.683,00:32:52.800,All right.
00:32:52.720,00:32:53.510,多谢王爷,00:32:53.691,00:32:55.052,I thank Your Lordship.
00:33:21.440,00:33:22.190,谁在外头,00:33:22.330,00:33:23.430,Who is that?
00:33:23.320,00:33:26.150,没有人哪 小主这是怎么了,00:33:24.410,00:33:25.652,There's no one outside.
,,,00:33:26.142,00:33:27.643,"What's the matter, My Lady?"
00:33:33.360,00:33:35.820,我和他身份有别 何来良人之说,00:33:34.000,00:33:36.500,"We live in two different worlds.
This poem doesn't apply."
00:33:38.800,00:33:41.030,小主怕是看书看得累了,00:33:36.500,00:33:37.689,[The Book of Songs]
00:33:41.640,00:33:42.830,不妨歇息会儿吧,00:33:39.940,00:33:44.001,My Lady should take a break if you're tired from reading.
00:33:43.680,00:33:44.900,这桌子上的漆也不好,,,
00:33:45.520,00:33:46.830,内务府也不知道来修修,00:33:44.717,00:33:46.458,The paint on this table is coming off.
,,,00:33:46.458,00:33:48.435,Why hasn't the Household Department fixed it?
00:33:48.560,00:33:50.670,小允子前几日已经去过了,00:33:49.460,00:33:52.126,Xiao-Yunzi requested service several days ago.
00:33:51.240,00:33:53.910,怕是过几日便会派人来修的,00:33:52.480,00:33:54.988,They'll probably send someone in a few days.
00:34:07.080,00:34:08.950,皇上您歇会儿吧,00:34:08.094,00:34:10.233,"Your Majesty, please take a break."
00:34:48.040,00:34:49.310,皇上您怎么不吹了呢,,,
00:34:50.280,00:34:51.830,奴才正洗耳恭听呢,00:34:49.178,00:34:52.900,"Why did Your Majesty stop?
My ears were enjoying what they heard."
00:34:52.240,00:34:55.190,朕吹得不好还是不要吹了,00:34:53.126,00:34:56.506,"I don't play the flute well.
I should leave it."
00:34:56.520,00:34:59.630,纯元皇后的箫声可是宫中一绝呀,00:34:57.556,00:35:00.996,Empress Première was the most esteemed flute player in the palace.
00:35:00.280,00:35:03.150,现在有人吹得跟她一样好,00:35:01.260,00:35:04.534,Now we have another player as skilled as her.
00:35:03.680,00:35:05.230,皇上您是说＋七爷,00:35:04.760,00:35:06.800,Is Your Majesty talking about Noble Prince Guo?
00:35:06.960,00:35:09.260,＋七爷最会吹笛子了,00:35:08.125,00:35:10.512,His Lordship is the best at playing the flute.
00:35:11.520,00:35:12.270,苏培盛,,,
00:35:12.440,00:35:12.990,嗻,,,
00:35:13.280,00:35:14.340,你去把老十七叫来,00:35:12.560,00:35:14.120,"- Su Peisheng.
-Yes."
00:35:14.600,00:35:15.310,嗻,00:35:14.120,00:35:15.734,Send for my seventeenth brother.
,,,00:35:15.734,00:35:16.716,Aye.
00:35:30.560,00:35:31.390,走了一个下午,,,
00:35:31.680,00:35:32.990,脸色怎么这样晦气,00:35:31.500,00:35:34.100,"You were gone the whole afternoon.
Why are you back with a gloomy face?"
00:35:33.720,00:35:34.700,去了趟内务府,,,
00:35:35.080,00:35:36.950,平白受了好些冷言冷语回来,00:35:34.560,00:35:37.860,"I went to the Household Department.
They only had cold words for me."
00:35:37.360,00:35:38.830,不就是拿桌上那些漆吗,,,
00:35:39.320,00:35:40.300,又不是拿月例,00:35:38.275,00:35:41.420,"You were just asking for some lacquer, not the monthly stipend."
00:35:40.600,00:35:42.270,怎么颠三倒四几次都没个结果,00:35:41.480,00:35:43.534,Why have you gotten nothing after so many trips?
00:35:42.760,00:35:43.590,如今华妃得势,,,
00:35:44.400,00:35:46.150,那些个狗眼看人低的家伙,,,
00:35:46.400,00:35:48.030,就捎带着不待见咱们碎玉轩,00:35:43.534,00:35:49.060,"Consort Fleur is in charge of the harem,
so those snobby curs look at us with disdain."
00:35:48.520,00:35:49.630,说我几句也就罢了,,,
00:35:50.000,00:35:51.220,连着小主也受了排挤,00:35:49.475,00:35:52.520,"I don't mind they what say about me,
but they disrespected My Lady."
00:35:51.680,00:35:53.390,平白受了好些不干不净的话,,,
00:35:53.760,00:35:55.270,内务府这班混蛋这么倡狂,00:35:52.640,00:35:54.918,They made many offensive remarks.
00:35:56.000,00:35:57.390,冬天克扣小主份例的炭,00:35:54.918,00:35:56.716,How dare those bastards?
00:35:57.840,00:35:59.390,现在连补个桌角也要挤对人,00:35:56.980,00:36:00.653,"They were withholding our charcoal in the winter,
and now won't even give us some paint."
00:36:00.880,00:36:02.100,小主还在里头呢,00:36:01.000,00:36:03.291,"Shh, My Lady is inside."
00:36:02.640,00:36:03.750,听了可要伤心的,00:36:03.480,00:36:05.651,She will feel sad if she hears it.
00:36:04.920,00:36:07.150,这可怎么好日子还长着呢,00:36:05.840,00:36:08.340,What should we do? This is just the start.
00:36:07.760,00:36:08.670,我们这些做奴婢的,,,
00:36:08.960,00:36:09.710,将就点也就罢了,00:36:08.717,00:36:10.760,We servants can get by.
00:36:10.000,00:36:11.950,可小主小主哪受得了这个闲气,00:36:10.760,00:36:13.364,But how can My Lady live with that attitude?
00:36:12.520,00:36:13.990,这个黄规全仗着是华妃的远亲,,,
00:36:14.360,00:36:14.830,就知道横行霸道,00:36:13.553,00:36:15.941,"Huang Guiquan is playing tyrant
all because he's related to Consort Fleur!"
00:36:15.120,00:36:15.830,好姑奶奶 姑奶奶,,,
00:36:16.200,00:36:18.190,你且忍着些吧 压点声好吗,00:36:15.941,00:36:18.713,"Good Madam, Good Madam, please keep it down."
00:36:22.360,00:36:25.310,既然内务府忙那就将就着用吧,00:36:23.500,00:36:26.656,"I can make do with the table
if the Household Department is busy."
00:36:26.240,00:36:27.790,也不是什么了不得的事,00:36:27.146,00:36:29.056,It's not a big deal.
00:36:28.720,00:36:29.430,是,00:36:29.773,00:36:30.680,Yes.
00:36:29.840,00:36:31.510,今日的话 你我都没听过,00:36:30.792,00:36:32.642,You and I heard nothing.
00:36:32.280,00:36:34.070,出去也不许指责他们一言半语,00:36:33.208,00:36:35.424,Don't blame them when you go out.
00:36:35.000,00:36:35.710,是,00:36:35.877,00:36:36.783,Yes.
00:36:38.120,00:36:39.550,跟着我这样的小主,00:36:39.180,00:36:41.593,Serving a concubine like me
00:36:40.880,00:36:42.790,的确是让你们受了不少委屈,00:36:42.159,00:36:44.159,must have brought all of you grievances.
00:36:44.920,00:36:46.430,小主又何出此言呢,,,
00:36:46.760,00:36:47.790,真是折煞奴婢了,00:36:45.970,00:36:48.980,"Why would you say that, My Lady?
I'm unworthy of such words."
00:36:48.640,00:36:50.190,奴婢从未觉得跟着小主,,,
00:36:50.560,00:36:51.620,有任何委屈,00:36:49.584,00:36:52.550,I've never felt any injustice being in your service.
00:36:54.040,00:36:58.110,后宫中人趋炎附势是寻常事,00:36:55.380,00:36:59.359,Everyone in the palace fawns over those hotly in favor.
00:36:59.000,00:37:00.190,他们自然不会把我这个,,,
00:37:00.520,00:37:02.110,久病无宠的小主放在眼里,00:37:00.000,00:37:03.440,"Naturally, no one would have a neglected concubine in their eyes."
00:37:03.000,00:37:05.190,皇兄一定是在哪里听到好的箫声,00:37:04.026,00:37:06.873,You must have heard some good flute music somewhere.
00:37:06.360,00:37:07.670,兴致这样地大,,,
00:37:08.480,00:37:10.710,这两天把宫里会吹箫的乐师,00:37:07.288,00:37:09.313,You can't even put the flute away.
00:37:11.160,00:37:12.140,都听了个遍吧,00:37:09.502,00:37:13.019,"You must have been listening to
all the flute players in the palace these days."
00:37:12.400,00:37:16.470,隔靴搔痒 不可同日而语呀,00:37:13.170,00:37:17.962,That's just like scratching the boot for an itching foot.
00:37:17.560,00:37:20.590,要皇兄听一首箫都这样的难哪,00:37:18.490,00:37:22.080,Is it that difficult to find a satisfying player?
00:37:23.920,00:37:25.550,不知是何方佳人哪,00:37:24.960,00:37:26.880,I wonder how pretty the player is.
00:37:29.160,00:37:30.300,你是坏透了,00:37:30.000,00:37:31.659,You're rotten to the bone.
00:37:34.640,00:37:37.230,余答应 皇上和果郡王在里头,,,
00:37:37.640,00:37:38.510,不见嫔妃,00:37:35.736,00:37:39.571,"Companion Yu, His Majesty is with Noble Prince Guo
and won't see any concubines."
00:37:39.160,00:37:40.190,我一连几日来,,,
00:37:40.600,00:37:42.510,你都说皇上与果郡王在一块,00:37:40.000,00:37:43.490,You've been saying that to me all these days.
00:37:43.560,00:37:44.830,你当我好糊弄是吧,,,
00:37:45.280,00:37:46.470,奴才说的是实话,00:37:44.660,00:37:46.141,Am I a fool to you?
00:37:46.840,00:37:48.110,小主要是不肯信奴才,00:37:46.405,00:37:47.887,"I am telling you the truth, My Lady."
00:37:48.600,00:37:49.710,那也没办法,00:37:47.887,00:37:50.418,There's nothing I can do if you don't believe me.
00:37:51.480,00:37:54.190,那就麻烦厦公公再去通传一下吧,00:37:52.500,00:37:55.620,"Can I trouble you to inform His Majesty, Mr. Xia?"
00:37:54.720,00:37:56.190,奴才已经回过小主的话,,,
00:37:56.840,00:37:58.310,皇上和果郡王在一起,00:37:55.620,00:37:57.620,"I have already told you, My Lady."
00:37:58.680,00:38:00.070,吩咐了不见嫔妃,00:37:57.846,00:38:01.677,"His Majesty is with Noble Prince Guo
and has instructed us not to send any concubines in."
00:38:01.040,00:38:01.870,小主何必为难,,,
00:38:02.240,00:38:03.430,咱们这些做奴才的呀,00:38:02.311,00:38:04.967,Why would you make it difficult for us servants?
00:38:52.840,00:38:54.630,听说余答应在养心殿前,,,
00:38:55.000,00:38:55.830,跪了大半宿,00:38:54.200,00:38:56.751,I heard that Companion Yu kneeled for half a night.
00:38:56.080,00:38:57.350,把皇上的心都跪软了,00:38:56.940,00:38:58.760,Her knees softened His Majesty's heart.
00:38:57.920,00:39:00.270,哪是跪软的呀 是唱软的,00:38:58.986,00:39:01.514,Not her knees. It was her songs.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.

Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
