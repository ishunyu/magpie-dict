00:02:23.600,00:02:26.350,皇上昨夜陪着沈贵人睡得有些晚,00:02:24.604,00:02:27.700,Your Majesty stayed up late with Lady Shen last night.
00:02:26.640,00:02:28.030,怎么不多睡一会儿啊,00:02:27.875,00:02:29.400,Why didn't Your Majesty sleep in a bit?
00:02:28.560,00:02:30.790,高兴归高兴 早朝还得照旧,00:02:29.400,00:02:32.795,"All the joy aside,
I had to hold court in the morning."
00:02:31.560,00:02:33.190,你昨夜也没睡好吧,,,
00:02:34.200,00:02:35.310,一来因为高兴,00:02:32.795,00:02:35.000,"You didn't sleep well either, did you?"
00:02:35.720,00:02:37.310,二来也吩咐了太医院,00:02:35.311,00:02:37.000,"For one thing, I was overjoyed;"
00:02:37.600,00:02:38.950,仔细看着沈贵人的胎,00:02:37.000,00:02:40.396,"for another, I was instructing the Imperial Infirmary
to take good care of Lady Shen."
00:02:40.960,00:02:41.870,有劳你了,00:02:41.871,00:02:43.331,Your hard work is appreciated.
00:02:44.440,00:02:45.550,沈贵人,00:02:45.440,00:02:46.860,Noble Lady Shen...
00:02:46.400,00:02:47.870,皇上有何吩咐啊,00:02:47.260,00:02:49.040,Is there something Your Majesty needs?
00:02:50.520,00:02:52.790,朕想晋一晋沈贵人的位分,00:02:51.582,00:02:54.402,I was thinking about promoting Noble Lady Shen.
00:02:53.640,00:02:56.390,沈贵人得皇上宠爱 又有了身孕,00:02:54.811,00:02:57.376,"Lady Shen has been favored by Your Majesty,
and now she is pregnant."
00:02:56.720,00:02:58.230,晋位也是应当的,00:02:57.565,00:02:59.672,Her promotion can be reasonably expected.
00:02:58.680,00:03:02.380,只是祖制并无嫔妃有孕或产子,,,
00:03:02.640,00:03:04.190,就须晋封的先例,00:03:00.000,00:03:05.328,"But there's no precedent to promote a concubine
upon pregnancy or delivery."
00:03:04.640,00:03:07.230,倒不全是因为她身孕的缘故,00:03:05.698,00:03:08.455,It's not entirely because of her pregnancy.
00:03:08.040,00:03:09.750,她是难得的稳重,00:03:08.815,00:03:10.800,Her steady personality is a rarity.
00:03:10.080,00:03:10.830,也是,00:03:11.040,00:03:12.445,That is true.
00:03:11.720,00:03:13.790,莞贵人聪敏机慧,00:03:12.671,00:03:15.285,"Compared to Lady Sourire's keen intellect,"
00:03:14.160,00:03:16.350,倒显得沈贵人稳重大方,00:03:15.285,00:03:17.500,Lady Shen is responsible and decorous.
00:03:16.920,00:03:19.380,皇上打算给沈贵人嫔位吧,00:03:17.800,00:03:20.305,"Does Your Majesty intend to promote
Lady Shen to Concubine?"
00:03:19.880,00:03:21.100,她担当得起,,,
00:03:21.400,00:03:22.230,那是自然,00:03:21.125,00:03:23.300,"- She's worthy of the title.
- Absolutely."
00:03:22.760,00:03:24.070,只是这样一来,,,
00:03:24.320,00:03:26.070,咸福宫就有两位主位了,00:03:24.141,00:03:27.689,"However, this would mean two Concubines
are the head of the Palace of Universal Happiness."
00:03:26.760,00:03:27.950,若要迁宫别居,,,
00:03:28.160,00:03:30.830,恐怕沈贵人有着身孕也不方便,00:03:27.720,00:03:32.038,"I'm afraid it would be inconvenient for Lady Shen
to move to another palace during her pregnancy."
00:03:31.360,00:03:33.510,倒不如诞下皇子的时候,,,
00:03:33.800,00:03:35.190,来个喜上加喜吧,00:03:32.494,00:03:36.500,"Instead, why don't we double her happiness
when she gives birth to an heir?"
00:03:37.560,00:03:38.910,这话说得也是,00:03:38.717,00:03:40.176,You are right.
00:03:39.560,00:03:42.710,只是朕总得赏她点什么吧,00:03:40.780,00:03:43.840,But I feel obliged to reward her.
00:03:43.840,00:03:45.750,金银珠宝的都是小巧,00:03:45.002,00:03:46.880,Jewelry would be too paltry.
00:03:46.880,00:03:48.590,既暂且不能封嫔,,,
00:03:49.080,00:03:50.270,不如先赐了封号,00:03:48.082,00:03:51.662,"Since her promotion is temporarily delayed,
I wish to give her an honorary name in advance."
00:03:51.280,00:03:52.910,皇上必定有主意了吧,00:03:52.040,00:03:54.340,Your Majesty must have a name in mind already.
00:03:53.480,00:03:57.350,朕想了个惠字,00:03:54.500,00:03:58.728,I'm thinking of naming her Vertu [惠Hui].
00:03:58.840,00:04:00.060,贤惠得体,,,
00:04:00.400,00:04:02.830,形容沈贵人是恰如其分,00:04:00.000,00:04:03.000,Virtuous and decorous - that perfectly describes her.
00:04:04.600,00:04:07.990,这莞贵人和沈贵人同为姐妹,00:04:05.774,00:04:09.399,Lady Sourire and Lady Shen are like sisters.
00:04:08.440,00:04:10.550,这下可真算是平起平坐了,00:04:09.625,00:04:11.665,Now they're truly on equal footing.
00:04:17.560,00:04:19.940,姐姐求子得子 当真是大喜啊,00:04:18.500,00:04:21.311,Your wish has come true. What a joyous occasion!
00:04:20.400,00:04:21.670,什么大喜呢,,,
00:04:21.920,00:04:23.470,突然间这里不许去,00:04:21.500,00:04:23.180,I don't see the joy of it.
00:04:23.920,00:04:24.980,那儿也不许动的,00:04:23.180,00:04:26.120,"All of a sudden I'm restricted from
doing everything and going anywhere."
00:04:25.240,00:04:26.460,当真是闷坏人了,00:04:26.346,00:04:27.403,It's such a bore!
00:04:26.680,00:04:29.190,还有九个月呢 不过也快,00:04:27.403,00:04:29.502,There are nine more [lunar] months to come.
,,,00:04:29.502,00:04:30.780,But the time will fly by.
00:04:29.720,00:04:32.470,我听槿汐说 怀孕八个月的时候,00:04:30.780,00:04:34.000,"Jinxi said that in the eighth month of your pregnancy,"
00:04:32.880,00:04:35.790,娘家的母亲就可以进宫亲自照拂,00:04:34.000,00:04:36.952,"your mother can come to the palace
and take care of you."
00:04:36.040,00:04:37.230,一家天伦团聚,00:04:36.952,00:04:38.621,A family reunion of three generations.
00:04:37.800,00:04:40.030,是吗 那可太好了,00:04:38.810,00:04:41.290,Really? That's wonderful!
00:04:43.080,00:04:45.310,我可是看上了你肚子里的那一位,00:04:44.161,00:04:46.561,I’ve set my eyes on the baby in your belly.
00:04:46.000,00:04:47.140,何时让我做他干娘,,,
00:04:48.280,00:04:50.030,瞧瞧你就这点出息,00:04:46.900,00:04:49.280,"When will you make me his honorary mother?
[a non-religious godmother]"
00:04:50.280,00:04:51.990,还怕没人叫你额娘不成,00:04:49.280,00:04:51.460,What use are you as an honorary mother?
,,,00:04:51.460,00:04:53.660,You'll be a mother soon as well.
00:04:52.560,00:04:56.180,现下是男是女都还不知道呢,00:04:53.800,00:04:57.200,We don't even know yet whether it's a boy or a girl.
00:04:56.400,00:04:57.870,无论男女 来者不拒,,,
00:04:58.480,00:05:00.550,可我倒盼着是位皇子,00:04:57.360,00:04:59.240,I'll take anything!
00:05:00.880,00:05:03.110,这样终身就有依靠了,00:04:59.617,00:05:04.797,"I'm hoping for a prince I can rely on
for the rest of my life."
00:05:04.280,00:05:06.350,我瞧着皇上如今宠爱你的样子,,,
00:05:06.760,00:05:08.310,无论男女他都会喜欢的,00:05:05.448,00:05:09.720,"With the place you hold in His Majesty's heart,
he will love your child either way."
00:05:09.480,00:05:11.190,恐怕不必等你出月子,,,
00:05:11.920,00:05:13.110,就又要晋封了吧,00:05:10.543,00:05:14.143,"I'm afraid you'll be promoted
while you're still sitting the month [postpartum confinement]."
00:05:13.760,00:05:15.030,你还在笑话我,,,
00:05:15.960,00:05:17.830,对了 今儿早起,00:05:14.784,00:05:16.560,Don't make fun of me.
00:05:18.080,00:05:19.750,我想起了一件很要紧的事,00:05:16.800,00:05:22.400,"I wanted to tell you something important.
I remembered it when I woke up this morning."
00:05:20.120,00:05:21.310,正要说给你听,,,
00:05:21.520,00:05:22.740,如今哪里还有比你身孕,,,
00:05:23.080,00:05:24.030,更要紧的事,00:05:22.626,00:05:25.180,"What could possibly be
more important than your pregnancy?"
00:05:24.360,00:05:25.420,这是正事,00:05:25.400,00:05:26.860,This is a serious matter.
00:05:26.120,00:05:29.190,华妃失势难免不会东山再起,00:05:27.237,00:05:30.820,"Although Consort Fleur has lost power,
it's inevitable that she will rise again."
00:05:29.800,00:05:32.070,我怕你一个人应付不过来,00:05:30.880,00:05:33.740,"I'm afraid that you won't
be able to manage her on your own."
00:05:32.720,00:05:34.830,而且我冷眼瞧着,,,
00:05:35.240,00:05:38.310,咱们那位皇上也不是位专宠的人,00:05:33.929,00:05:39.909,"Looking with unclouded eyes, I don't expect His Majesty
to devote himself to just one woman."
00:05:39.720,00:05:42.750,我是怕有人会拣这个空子占便宜,00:05:40.960,00:05:44.360,"Someone might take advantage of
the vacancy during my pregnancy."
00:05:45.080,00:05:48.230,你的意思是要接陵容来,00:05:46.210,00:05:49.600,Are you suggesting... that we bring Lingrong here?
00:05:49.040,00:05:49.790,不错,00:05:50.000,00:05:51.080,Exactly.
00:05:50.040,00:05:52.910,你看你 上回还说陵容心狠,00:05:51.080,00:05:52.740,Look at you!
00:05:53.320,00:05:54.670,这会儿又觉得她在好了,00:05:52.740,00:05:56.100,"You were the one who called her ruthless.
Now you wish she was here."
00:05:55.200,00:05:57.630,你不知道 狠有狠的好处,00:05:56.289,00:05:59.189,"Well, being ruthless has its own benefits."
00:05:58.000,00:05:59.270,我还不是怕你一个人,,,
00:05:59.560,00:06:00.540,应付不过来吗,00:05:59.280,00:06:01.591,I don't want you to be on your own.
00:06:01.000,00:06:02.590,先把她接来再说,,,
00:06:02.840,00:06:04.350,不至于有什么变故的时候,00:06:02.006,00:06:06.940,"Let's get her here, so we won't be
at our wits' end if there is a crisis."
00:06:04.600,00:06:05.870,大家手足无措,,,
00:06:06.800,00:06:09.360,我会尽快和皇上提这件事,00:06:08.000,00:06:10.660,"I will make the request to His Majesty
at his earliest convenience."
00:06:09.680,00:06:12.240,想来皇上也不会拒绝,00:06:10.660,00:06:13.740,I don't believe he will refuse.
00:06:13.280,00:06:15.710,如今你是皇上跟前一等一的红人,,,
00:06:16.240,00:06:17.550,自然是有求必应,00:06:14.200,00:06:19.100,"Now that you're His Majesty's number-one concubine,
all your requests will be granted."
00:06:19.080,00:06:22.030,只是你这样小心筹谋难免伤身子,00:06:20.040,00:06:23.380,But exerting yourself mentally can still harm your health.
00:06:22.680,00:06:24.190,安心养胎才是要紧,00:06:23.757,00:06:25.538,The baby is your top priority.
00:06:24.520,00:06:26.470,是 妹妹说得对,00:06:25.538,00:06:27.701,You're right.
00:06:43.560,00:06:44.310,姐姐,00:06:44.460,00:06:45.607,Sourire!
00:06:45.840,00:06:47.150,总算把你给盼来了,00:06:46.807,00:06:48.383,You've finally arrived.
00:06:57.000,00:06:58.110,路上热不热,,,
00:06:58.400,00:06:59.070,还好,00:06:58.400,00:07:00.680,"- How was the trip?
- It was all right."
00:07:00.480,00:07:02.750,大热天的 姐姐怎么亲自站着,00:07:01.600,00:07:04.520,You shouldn't have been waiting for me outside.
00:07:03.400,00:07:04.430,你可是最怕热了,,,
00:07:04.800,00:07:05.830,让妹妹好担心啊,00:07:04.520,00:07:07.380,"It's such a hot day.
I hope you are not affected by the heat."
00:07:07.800,00:07:09.670,对了 眉姐姐一句话,,,
00:07:10.080,00:07:11.060,就把我给接来了,00:07:09.051,00:07:12.211,"I was permitted to come here
all because Meizhuang put in a word for me."
00:07:11.400,00:07:12.380,眉姐姐可好吗,,,
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.470,一切都好,00:07:12.400,00:07:13.820,How is she?
00:07:14.000,00:07:16.300,如今你来了 她更高兴,00:07:13.820,00:07:14.820,She's well.
00:07:18.120,00:07:20.630,对了 我路上就听太监们说,00:07:15.000,00:07:17.780,She's even happier now that you're here.
00:07:21.240,00:07:22.910,眉姐姐现在有了身孕,00:07:19.120,00:07:25.500,"On the way here, the eunuchs were saying that His Majesty
indulges all of Meizhuang's desires after she became pregnant."
00:07:23.160,00:07:24.710,皇上处处都随着她,,,
00:07:25.680,00:07:28.590,传闻不如一见 你见到她便知了,00:07:26.640,00:07:29.920,"""Seeing is believing."" You'll see for yourself."
00:07:29.920,00:07:32.300,既然来了 先向皇上去请安吧,00:07:31.196,00:07:33.762,"But before that, we shall pay respects to His Majesty."
00:07:33.560,00:07:34.670,一切听从姐姐的,00:07:34.700,00:07:36.236,I'll follow your advice.
00:07:44.120,00:07:46.420,阿哥在日头下跪了大半日了,00:07:45.000,00:07:47.816,"Prince, you've been kneeling here for half a day now."
00:07:46.760,00:07:49.630,先回去吧 仔细中了暑气,00:07:48.080,00:07:51.100,You should go back so as not to get sunstroke.
00:07:51.280,00:07:52.030,苏公公,00:07:52.500,00:07:53.419,Mr. Su.
00:07:53.400,00:07:55.910,莞贵人吉祥 安答应吉祥,00:07:54.300,00:07:57.127,"Peace to Lady Sourire.
Peace to Companion An."
00:07:57.040,00:07:59.500,苏公公 那孩子是谁啊,00:07:58.216,00:08:00.756,"Mr. Su, who is that child?"
00:08:00.960,00:08:03.950,那是四阿哥 想求见皇上呢,00:08:02.000,00:08:05.000,"That is the Fourth Prince.
He wishes to see His Majesty."
00:08:04.240,00:08:04.950,四阿哥,,,
00:08:05.800,00:08:07.070,从前从未听说过,00:08:05.174,00:08:06.394,The Fourth Prince?
00:08:07.760,00:08:09.430,一直在圆明园养着呢,00:08:06.964,00:08:08.480,I've never heard of him.
00:08:10.040,00:08:12.070,那皇上没空见四阿哥,00:08:08.782,00:08:11.040,He's been living here in the Summer Palace.
00:08:13.560,00:08:16.070,眼下皇上怕是也没心情,00:08:11.229,00:08:13.629,Does His Majesty not have time to see the Fourth Prince?
00:08:16.360,00:08:17.310,见二位小主了,00:08:14.500,00:08:18.520,I'm afraid His Majesty is not in the mood to see you two either.
00:08:17.760,00:08:18.900,小主先请回吧,00:08:18.800,00:08:20.591,"My Ladies, you should come at another time."
00:08:19.880,00:08:22.670,姐姐 那要不,00:08:20.780,00:08:24.000,Sourire... Shall we ...
00:08:23.320,00:08:24.590,我们还是先回去吧,00:08:24.220,00:08:26.800,go back for now?
00:08:26.880,00:08:27.990,好可怜的孩子,,,
00:08:29.160,00:08:30.430,阿哥怕中了暑气,00:08:28.000,00:08:30.000,Poor child!
00:08:31.160,00:08:32.270,等一下烦请公公,,,
00:08:32.520,00:08:34.310,为阿哥送一碗莲子百合解暑,00:08:30.226,00:08:35.000,"Sir, may I trouble you to send the Fourth Prince
some lotus seed soup to relieve the summer heat?"
00:08:35.040,00:08:35.870,奴才会的,00:08:35.900,00:08:37.300,"I will, My Lady."
00:08:39.760,00:08:40.950,圆明园里人不多,,,
00:08:41.480,00:08:43.630,妹妹来了就更热闹了,,,
00:08:43.880,00:08:45.470,我如今能到圆明园来,00:08:42.616,00:08:45.300,"Now that you're here, the gardens will be even livelier."
00:08:45.680,00:08:46.900,都是姐姐们记挂着,00:08:45.460,00:08:48.540,"I would not be able to come
were it not for the care of you and Meizhuang."
00:08:47.360,00:08:49.070,皇上和华妃和好了吗,,,
00:08:49.520,00:08:50.990,华妃离皇上的住所远,00:08:48.540,00:08:50.600,Has Consort Fleur mended fences with His Majesty?
00:08:51.280,00:08:52.230,日常也不太见到,00:08:50.600,00:08:53.440,"She lives far away from His Majesty's residence.
They don't get to see each other a lot."
00:08:52.480,00:08:54.470,奴婢给两位小主请安,00:08:53.440,00:08:56.040,Peace to My Ladies.
00:08:55.640,00:08:57.430,儿臣给莞娘娘请安,00:08:56.754,00:08:58.640,I bow in respect before Your Highness Lady Sourire.
00:08:57.840,00:08:59.470,莞娘娘万福金安,00:08:58.640,00:09:01.000,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:09:00.400,00:09:02.190,张嬷嬷 这位是莞贵人,00:09:01.296,00:09:03.296,"Madam Zhang, this is Noble Lady Sourire."
00:09:02.800,00:09:03.710,莞贵人,,,
00:09:04.080,00:09:04.950,四阿哥请起,00:09:03.698,00:09:04.998,My Lady.
00:09:06.160,00:09:07.380,我与阿哥素未相见,00:09:05.300,00:09:06.698,"Please rise, Fourth Prince."
00:09:08.040,00:09:09.430,阿哥怎知我身份,00:09:07.188,00:09:10.580,"We've never met before.
How did you know who I am?"
00:09:09.920,00:09:11.630,勤政殿外遥遥一见,,,
00:09:12.160,00:09:14.910,儿臣觉得莞娘娘十分亲切,00:09:11.033,00:09:16.200,"Outside the Governance Hall, I could see Your Highness's
generous spirit even by a distant glimpse."
00:09:15.320,00:09:16.300,所以认得,,,
00:09:16.760,00:09:18.830,娘娘不是也认得儿臣吗,00:09:16.200,00:09:17.915,That was how I recognized Your Highness.
00:09:19.520,00:09:20.830,诚如阿哥所言,00:09:17.915,00:09:20.280,And Your Highness knew me as well.
00:09:21.080,00:09:22.950,遥遥一见已觉亲切,00:09:20.544,00:09:24.098,"Likewise, I had the same impression of you."
00:09:23.160,00:09:24.910,儿臣与莞娘娘有缘,,,
00:09:25.200,00:09:26.310,有劳阿哥记挂,00:09:24.098,00:09:26.189,I share an affinity with Your Highness.
00:09:27.600,00:09:28.660,这位是安答应,00:09:26.420,00:09:27.716,Thank you for remembering me.
00:09:29.000,00:09:30.110,安娘娘吉祥,00:09:28.508,00:09:29.860,This is Companion An.
00:09:31.800,00:09:32.830,四阿哥有礼,00:09:29.860,00:09:31.800,Peace to Your Highness.
00:09:37.520,00:09:38.230,妹妹,00:09:33.010,00:09:34.741,"That is very courteous of you, Fourth Prince."
00:09:38.640,00:09:40.670,你先回住处看看合不合心意,00:09:38.880,00:09:42.000,"Lingrong, how about you go and have a look at your residence?"
00:09:41.040,00:09:42.100,等一下我再和妹妹,,,
00:09:42.400,00:09:43.350,一同去看眉姐姐,00:09:42.100,00:09:44.526,I will go with you to visit Meizhuang later.
00:09:45.840,00:09:47.230,那妹妹先告辞了,,,
00:09:47.920,00:09:49.390,流朱 你陪安小主去,00:09:47.080,00:09:48.780,I shall take my leave.
00:09:49.600,00:09:50.230,是,00:09:49.000,00:09:51.580,"- Vermilion, you will go with her.
- Yes."
00:09:56.760,00:09:59.430,张嬷嬷 我和莞娘娘有话要说,,,
00:09:59.760,00:10:00.510,你走远些,00:09:58.000,00:10:01.920,"Madam Zhang, I wish to have a word with Lady Sourire.
Can you stand aside?"
00:10:01.040,00:10:01.790,是,,,
00:10:08.320,00:10:10.110,张嬷嬷似乎很关心阿哥,00:10:09.442,00:10:11.900,Madam Zhang seems to care a lot for you.
00:10:10.720,00:10:13.590,阿哥有什么话连张嬷嬷也回避,00:10:11.900,00:10:14.900,"What would you like to say to me
that she can't even listen?"
00:10:15.120,00:10:16.390,儿臣唐突冒失,,,
00:10:17.160,00:10:19.720,只因莞娘娘日日在皇阿玛身边,00:10:16.085,00:10:20.000,"I hope Your Highness will forgive my intruding,
but I thought you could answer my question"
00:10:20.000,00:10:21.670,最得皇阿玛圣心,00:10:20.000,00:10:23.400,because you know Imperial Father the best as his favorite concubine.
00:10:22.360,00:10:24.660,儿臣只想问莞娘娘一句话,00:10:23.440,00:10:26.280,"Your Highness, I simply wish to know ..."
00:10:25.480,00:10:27.590,皇阿玛是不是不喜欢我,00:10:26.544,00:10:29.110,Is it true that Imperial Father doesn't like me?
00:10:30.280,00:10:33.150,怎么会 你皇阿玛只是太忙了,00:10:31.320,00:10:34.740,"Why would you think that way?
His Majesty is just too busy."
00:10:33.800,00:10:36.710,那为何皇阿玛年年把我扔在这里,,,
00:10:37.080,00:10:38.220,从不来看我,00:10:34.966,00:10:39.300,"But why has he been keeping me here
for all these years and never visited me?"
00:10:38.560,00:10:40.750,也很少让我向他磕头请安,,,
00:10:41.120,00:10:43.030,尽一尽儿臣的本分,00:10:39.500,00:10:44.140,"And he never lets me bow and pay respects to him
to fulfill my filial piety?"
00:10:44.440,00:10:47.150,天下事太多了 皇上忙不过来,00:10:45.542,00:10:48.700,"His Majesty is busy administering
all affairs under Heaven."
00:10:47.640,00:10:50.710,况且 阿哥虽然一直在园子里,,,
00:10:51.000,00:10:51.950,甚少见到皇上,00:10:48.700,00:10:53.320,"Although you've been living here and rarely seeing His Majesty,"
00:10:52.400,00:10:53.790,但皇上牵挂阿哥之心,,,
00:10:54.280,00:10:55.310,并不比五阿哥少,00:10:53.380,00:10:56.780,he cares about you no less than the Fifth Prince.
00:10:56.000,00:10:58.710,你看五阿哥不也一直寄养在外吗,00:10:57.044,00:11:00.600,The Fifth Prince has been living outside the Forbidden City as well.
00:10:59.880,00:11:02.470,五阿哥有他的额娘 我没有,00:11:00.780,00:11:03.820,"The Fifth Prince has his mother, but I don't."
00:11:02.960,00:11:05.910,我额娘身份低微 被人瞧不起,00:11:04.009,00:11:07.200,My mother was disdained for her low birth.
00:11:07.480,00:11:08.590,人贵自重,,,
00:11:09.920,00:11:12.150,我虽不知你额娘出身是否卑微,00:11:08.620,00:11:10.924,A man's value comes from within himself.
00:11:13.120,00:11:15.310,但父母爱子之心人人皆是,00:11:10.924,00:11:13.920,"Although I know nothing about your mother,"
00:11:16.760,00:11:18.790,别人如何轻贱你都不要紧,00:11:14.146,00:11:17.580,I'm sure she loves you the same as every mother.
00:11:19.280,00:11:22.150,重要的是你自己别轻贱了自己,00:11:17.844,00:11:23.620,"It doesn't matter what others think about you.
It's what you think of yourself that counts!"
00:11:22.680,00:11:25.470,来日别人自然不敢轻贱你分毫,00:11:23.680,00:11:27.000,"In the days to come, they will not dare to
have the least contempt for you."
00:11:26.520,00:11:27.190,真的吗,00:11:27.459,00:11:28.600,For real?
00:11:29.120,00:11:31.950,阿哥若不信 自然也不会来问我,00:11:30.000,00:11:33.474,You wouldn't have come to ask me if you didn't trust me.
00:11:32.680,00:11:34.230,多谢莞娘娘提点,,,
00:11:35.200,00:11:36.150,只是有一点,00:11:33.760,00:11:35.920,I'm grateful for Your Highness's advice!
00:11:37.040,00:11:39.150,我与阿哥仅遥遥一面之缘,00:11:36.146,00:11:42.260,But why would you trust me the first time we met?
00:11:39.560,00:11:40.870,阿哥为何要信任我呢,,,
00:11:41.600,00:11:44.270,能做皇阿玛宠妃的人一定不简单,00:11:42.713,00:11:46.000,"I think a concubine wouldn't win
Imperial Father's favor for no reason."
00:11:45.120,00:11:46.630,何况听说莞娘娘,,,
00:11:46.960,00:11:48.510,连华妃娘娘都不怕,00:11:46.264,00:11:49.940,And I heard Your Highness is not even afraid of Consort Fleur.
00:11:49.000,00:11:51.380,儿臣敬佩有勇有谋的人,00:11:50.200,00:11:53.000,I admire you as a person possessing bravery and brains.
00:11:52.480,00:11:55.830,阿哥的赞誉我实在担当不起,00:11:53.464,00:11:57.300,I do not deserve your compliments.
00:11:57.560,00:11:59.590,只是有一句话要跟阿哥说,00:11:58.486,00:12:00.640,I hope you will remember this:
00:12:00.320,00:12:01.790,与其心生敬佩,,,
00:12:02.600,00:12:04.150,不如自己便是那样的人,00:12:01.281,00:12:05.307,"instead of admire someone, become them."
00:12:05.520,00:12:07.190,皇阿玛真的很忙吗,,,
00:12:07.840,00:12:09.060,要是真忙不过来,00:12:06.603,00:12:08.651,Is Imperial Father really very busy?
00:12:09.320,00:12:10.990,以后儿臣帮皇阿玛管,00:12:08.880,00:12:12.000,"If so, I will administer the country for him when I grow up."
00:12:12.000,00:12:13.060,这话可不能乱说,00:12:12.200,00:12:12.960,"Aiya,"
,,,00:12:13.149,00:12:14.729,you must not say such things.
00:12:18.160,00:12:20.190,来 我带你去吃点心,00:12:19.300,00:12:21.448,Would you like to go have some snacks?
00:12:20.360,00:12:20.950,好,00:12:21.448,00:12:22.211,Sure!
,,,00:12:32.320,00:12:34.792,"Jiuzhou Qingyan
[The Peaceful Nine States]"
00:12:46.720,00:12:48.390,这里既凉快又精致,,,
00:12:48.680,00:12:49.790,果然是个好地方,00:12:47.920,00:12:51.151,"This is such a nice place!
It's so pleasant and cooling in here."
00:12:50.560,00:12:52.510,丝竹之声从湖上传来,,,
00:12:52.760,00:12:54.310,在这儿听得也最清楚,00:12:51.717,00:12:55.456,"The music comes from the lake
and can be best appreciated here."
00:12:58.600,00:12:59.390,宫规严谨,,,
00:13:00.000,00:13:02.150,亲贵男子不到大节庆,00:12:59.640,00:13:04.916,"The highly-ranked nobles are only allowed
to join the palace's most important celebrations."
00:13:02.400,00:13:03.710,不得与嫔妃同聚,,,
00:13:04.120,00:13:06.030,这些亲王贵眷我都不认得,00:13:05.105,00:13:07.405,I do not recognize any of the lords and ladies.
00:13:06.880,00:13:07.990,姐姐可认得吗,00:13:07.480,00:13:09.360,Do you know who they are?
00:13:09.440,00:13:12.350,那是五爷恒亲王和他的侧福晋,00:13:10.200,00:13:14.720,"That is Lord V,  State Prince Heng [prince of the first rank],
with his Prince Consort."
00:13:20.400,00:13:22.350,第一位的样子看上去好威严,,,
00:13:22.840,00:13:23.670,叫人害怕,00:13:21.540,00:13:25.251,"The first one from the left looks very dignified.
He inspires awe in me."
00:13:28.640,00:13:31.310,不过见着对福晋却挺好,00:13:29.660,00:13:32.776,But he seems very nice to his wife.
00:13:33.400,00:13:35.310,那是十爷 他生母,00:13:33.078,00:13:34.871,(State Prince Dun)
00:13:35.520,00:13:37.670,是先帝孝昭仁皇后的亲妹妹,00:13:34.871,00:13:38.751,"That is Lord X, whose mother was the younger sister
of the prior emperor's empress."
00:13:38.360,00:13:40.350,身份贵重 自然不怒自威,00:13:39.204,00:13:42.284,His lofty birth gives him an air of authority.
00:13:42.960,00:13:44.470,十爷不得先帝宠爱,,,
00:13:44.760,00:13:46.070,是出了名的坏脾气,00:13:43.800,00:13:47.840,"However, the prior emperor wasn't very fond of
Lord X for his notorious temper."
00:13:46.640,00:13:48.750,可是对福晋却是极其疼爱,00:13:48.040,00:13:50.640,But Lord X is extremely nice to his wife.
00:13:49.680,00:13:52.310,都说威武不屈才是男子汉,00:13:50.640,00:13:53.971,"They say a real man is defined by his might,"
00:13:53.240,00:13:56.190,我瞧着会疼人的才是男子汉呢,00:13:54.160,00:13:57.820,"but in my eyes, a real man is defined by his love for his family."
00:14:03.160,00:14:06.910,老十 朕先敬你与福晋一杯,00:14:04.300,00:14:08.700,"Tenth brother, I'd like to make a toast
to you and your wife."
00:14:10.360,00:14:11.390,多谢皇上,00:14:11.340,00:14:13.120,I thank Your Majesty.
00:14:26.880,00:14:29.750,姐姐 瞧这敦亲王,,,
00:14:30.080,00:14:31.270,貌似对皇上不敬,00:14:27.700,00:14:32.640,"Sourire, State Prince Dun seems
disrespectful to His Majesty."
00:14:32.040,00:14:33.590,为何皇上还这般笼络,00:14:32.800,00:14:35.340,Why is His Majesty so gracious to him?
00:14:35.560,00:14:36.910,皇上刚登基不久,,,
00:14:37.560,00:14:38.950,自然不欲朝纲不稳,,,
00:14:39.240,00:14:40.350,落个不友不悌的罪名,00:14:36.400,00:14:42.120,"After the nine princes' battle for the throne,
His Majesty must stabilize the government and the imperial family."
00:14:50.800,00:14:52.670,这个老十七不知道又见到了,,,
00:14:53.000,00:14:54.350,什么新鲜玩意儿不肯挪步,,,
00:14:54.600,00:14:55.580,这个时候还不来,00:14:52.000,00:14:57.040,"I wonder what's keeping my seventeenth brother this time.
He still hasn't appeared."
00:14:55.880,00:14:57.790,皇上 您是知道十七哥的,00:14:57.100,00:14:59.160,Your Majesty knows how he is.
00:14:58.480,00:15:00.590,他是最随性自在的,00:14:59.160,00:15:02.200,"He is bound by no rules.
[Venerable Prince Shen, the 21st prince of the prior emperor]"
00:15:01.840,00:15:03.230,左不过是家宴,00:15:02.953,00:15:05.112,A family banquet isn't a big deal after all.
00:15:03.680,00:15:06.430,朕也看他逃席惯了 就由他吧,00:15:05.112,00:15:08.199,He's usually missing for such occasions. I'll let him be.
00:15:09.800,00:15:13.750,惠贵人 这个发簪真是精致啊,00:15:10.777,00:15:15.240,"Lady Vertu, that is a very nice hairpin you're wearing."
00:15:14.880,00:15:16.270,是太后新赏的吧,,,
00:15:16.960,00:15:17.750,是,00:15:15.600,00:15:18.080,Is it a new gift from the Empress Dowager?
00:15:18.240,00:15:20.230,太后知道惠贵人有孕,00:15:18.080,00:15:19.240,Yes.
00:15:20.440,00:15:22.110,特意地叫人送了来,00:15:19.300,00:15:23.620,"The Empress Dowager specially had the hairpin sent here
after hearing about Lady Vertu's pregnancy."
00:15:22.920,00:15:24.990,那簪首上的合和二仙,,,
00:15:25.360,00:15:28.550,是多子多福 如意双全之意,00:15:23.989,00:15:30.229,"The Two Gods of Harmony on the hairpin will
bless her with plentiful children and good fortune."
00:15:30.640,00:15:31.830,这支簪子贵在,,,
00:15:32.120,00:15:34.310,是太后怀十四爷的时候戴过,00:15:31.300,00:15:35.700,"The Empress Dowager received the hairpin when she was
pregnant with Lord XIV [enemy and brother of the emperor]."
00:15:34.720,00:15:37.310,由此可见 太后是多盼着,,,
00:15:37.640,00:15:38.990,惠贵人肚子里的孩子,00:15:35.700,00:15:40.546,"On that account, we can see how much the Empress Dowager
is looking forward to Lady Vertu's child."
00:15:39.640,00:15:40.860,我也好想知道,,,
00:15:41.160,00:15:43.540,到底是多俊的一个阿哥呢,00:15:40.700,00:15:44.880,I can't wait to see what an adorable prince he will be.
00:15:44.560,00:15:46.030,哪里一定是阿哥呢,,,
00:15:46.320,00:15:47.510,我倒盼着是个公主,00:15:45.585,00:15:47.300,Who says it's a prince?
00:15:47.800,00:15:49.310,和温宜一样的可爱呢,00:15:47.300,00:15:50.400,I'm hoping for a princess who's as adorable as Wenyi.

00:22:35.200,00:22:36.070,这是莞贵人,00:22:36.222,00:22:37.836,This is Noble Lady Sourire.
00:22:40.000,00:22:42.910,嫔妾有所冒犯 请王爷勿要见怪,00:22:41.120,00:22:44.376,I hope Your Lordship will forgive my offense.
00:22:44.280,00:22:45.190,你家王爷喝醉了,,,
00:22:45.640,00:22:46.510,扶他去醒醒酒吧,00:22:45.192,00:22:47.552,His Lordship is inebriated. Please take care of him.
00:22:47.160,00:22:48.750,嗻 走吧,00:22:48.080,00:22:48.841,Yes.
00:22:49.000,00:22:51.350,皇上还在等嫔妾 先告辞,00:22:49.406,00:22:50.665,We should go.
00:22:54.160,00:22:54.990,你叫什么名字,00:22:50.665,00:22:53.300,"His Majesty is waiting for me.
I bid Your Lordship goodbye."
00:22:56.400,00:22:57.950,贱名恐污了王爷尊耳,00:22:55.189,00:22:56.689,What is your name?
00:22:58.840,00:23:00.990,王爷喝醉了 请回去歇息吧,00:22:57.380,00:22:59.580,My humble name could taint Your Lordship's ears.
,,,00:22:59.844,00:23:03.124,Your Lordship should have some rest to attain sobriety.
00:23:04.560,00:23:06.150,今日之事一个人都不许说起,00:23:05.660,00:23:07.740,You must keep this to yourself.
00:23:06.920,00:23:09.350,否则我死无葬身之地,00:23:07.966,00:23:11.026,"If not, I'll have no burial ground for my corpse."
00:23:22.240,00:23:23.550,敬嫔娘娘万福金安,,,
00:23:23.840,00:23:25.310,快起来 快起来 快起来,00:23:23.500,00:23:25.000,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:23:27.040,00:23:29.110,我方才看妹妹不胜酒力,00:23:25.000,00:23:26.400,"Please rise, rise quickly."
00:23:29.720,00:23:31.350,便抽空出来看看,00:23:28.300,00:23:32.820,"I noticed that you were feeling tipsy,
so I thought I should come check on you."
00:23:31.760,00:23:34.220,谁知妹妹已经不在里头了,00:23:32.840,00:23:35.500,"But when I came outside, you weren't around any more."
00:23:34.520,00:23:35.990,原是我觉着酒劲上来了,,,
00:23:36.520,00:23:37.740,所以出去走了走,00:23:35.820,00:23:39.000,"The wine was stronger than I expected
so I took a walk to sober up."
00:23:39.280,00:23:41.390,这歌舞啊 年年都看,00:23:40.380,00:23:42.780,We observe one celebration after another.
00:23:41.760,00:23:43.070,我倒觉得乏味了,00:23:42.780,00:23:44.680,The performance has begun to pall.
00:23:44.560,00:23:45.910,就当偷个懒,,,
00:23:46.720,00:23:49.100,不知妹妹可否愿意,00:23:45.700,00:23:47.680,I want to give myself a break.
00:23:49.600,00:23:52.270,陪我到侧殿小坐片刻,00:23:47.982,00:23:53.760,I wonder if you would like to join me in the side chamber.
00:23:53.560,00:23:56.310,娘娘盛情 嫔妾自当从命,00:23:54.637,00:23:57.880,I'm honored to obey Your Highness's gracious invitation.
00:23:59.840,00:24:01.950,皇上 臣妾心想,,,
00:24:02.400,00:24:03.830,今日这歌舞虽盛,00:24:01.125,00:24:06.465,"Your Majesty, may I suggest that we dispense with
formality after the magnificent performance?"
00:24:04.040,00:24:05.470,却未免刻板了些,,,
00:24:06.160,00:24:09.150,既是家宴 在座的又都是亲眷,00:24:06.880,00:24:10.500,A family should not be sitting so stiffly for a meal.
00:24:09.560,00:24:11.910,不如想些轻松的玩意儿可好,00:24:10.600,00:24:13.380,How about we relax a bit on this joyous occasion?
00:24:13.160,00:24:14.790,你有什么主意说来听听,,,
00:24:15.280,00:24:17.310,在座的姐妹既是陪伴圣驾,00:24:14.380,00:24:16.320,What's your idea? Tell us.
00:24:17.840,00:24:19.190,自然身有所长,00:24:16.320,00:24:20.540,Each and every concubine present has her special talents.
00:24:19.920,00:24:22.710,不如将这些长处写出来抓阉,00:24:21.200,00:24:23.963,We can write down their talents and draw lots.
00:24:23.000,00:24:24.390,无论谁抓到了什么,,,
00:24:24.800,00:24:26.070,便出来以娱宾客,00:24:23.963,00:24:27.300,Whoever is selected will entertain our guests with her artistic flair.
00:24:26.400,00:24:27.750,皇上觉得如何,00:24:27.400,00:24:28.940,What does Your Majesty think?
00:24:28.280,00:24:31.790,这主意倒新鲜 就按你说的办吧,00:24:29.000,00:24:31.040,That is a fresh idea.
00:24:33.120,00:24:33.870,是,00:24:31.764,00:24:33.120,Let's draw lots.
00:24:34.560,00:24:36.310,妹妹心善是好事,00:24:34.040,00:24:35.420,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:24:36.600,00:24:37.710,可是在这宫里,00:24:36.000,00:24:37.600,"Sourire, you have a good heart."
00:24:37.920,00:24:40.550,只一味地心善就只能坏事了,00:24:37.640,00:24:41.880,"But in the palace, it is a bad thing
if all you have is a good heart."
00:24:41.920,00:24:43.390,唯要牢记一句话,,,
00:24:43.680,00:24:46.270,明哲保身才是最要紧的,00:24:42.940,00:24:47.438,"You must remember that
your priority is always to protect yourself."
00:24:47.400,00:24:48.540,多谢姐姐提点,,,
00:24:49.080,00:24:50.350,妹妹心性愚钝,00:24:48.500,00:24:50.160,I'm grateful for Your Highness's advice.
00:24:50.640,00:24:52.110,还望姐姐多指点我,00:24:50.311,00:24:53.460,I hope Your Highness can enlighten my dull-witted mind.
00:24:53.440,00:24:55.070,四阿哥你也看到了,,,
00:24:55.360,00:24:57.870,心性聪明又没病没灾的,00:24:54.700,00:24:59.049,"You've met the Fourth Prince.
He's bright and healthy."
00:24:58.160,00:25:00.430,可是为什么皇上最不愿意见他呢,00:24:59.200,00:25:02.000,But why does His Majesty avoid seeing him?
00:25:01.880,00:25:04.110,妹妹你可揣测过圣意,00:25:02.980,00:25:05.680,Have you thought from the perspective of His Majesty?
00:25:05.120,00:25:06.310,是我疏忽了,00:25:06.126,00:25:07.866,It was my negligence.
00:25:06.960,00:25:09.470,这宫里有母凭子贵之说,00:25:08.000,00:25:11.224,"We've heard that a concubine can become
distinguished by an esteemed son"
00:25:09.920,00:25:13.070,殊不知道还有子凭母贵之说呢,00:25:11.224,00:25:14.500,but it is also true the other way around.
00:25:14.080,00:25:15.670,四阿哥久失圣心,,,
00:25:15.920,00:25:18.830,那是因为他的生母是热河行宫里,00:25:15.300,00:25:21.840,"His Majesty dislikes the Fourth Prince
because his mother was a menial maid at the Rehe Imperial Resort."
00:25:19.240,00:25:20.460,一个粗使的宫女,,,
00:25:25.720,00:25:27.830,这是咱们当今圣上,,,
00:25:28.240,00:25:29.510,还是郡王的时候,00:25:26.700,00:25:30.600,It happened when His Majesty was a noble prince.
00:25:30.160,00:25:32.190,有一次和八王爷起了争执,,,
00:25:32.440,00:25:33.990,一时失意喝多了酒,00:25:31.241,00:25:35.300,"One day His Majesty had a dispute with Lord VIII
and ended up drinking too much."
00:25:34.600,00:25:36.030,就宠幸了一个宫女,00:25:35.526,00:25:37.646,That was how he bestowed favor upon the maid
00:25:36.840,00:25:40.620,谁知这一夕之幸就有了四阿哥,00:25:38.180,00:25:42.200,and that accidentally led to her having the Fourth Prince.
00:25:41.560,00:25:44.230,这事又被八王爷知道了,,,
00:25:44.480,00:25:45.540,告知了先帝爷,00:25:42.800,00:25:46.714,Lord VIII found out and reported this to the prior emperor
00:25:46.280,00:25:48.110,先帝就以当今圣上,,,
00:25:48.400,00:25:50.430,行为不检为由大加斥责,,,
00:25:50.680,00:25:52.230,差点撸了他郡王的名号,00:25:47.680,00:25:53.520,"who censured our emperor for his misconduct
and nearly stripped him of his title."
00:25:54.200,00:25:56.270,这个宫女又长相丑陋不堪,,,
00:25:56.600,00:25:57.470,出身微贱,00:25:55.366,00:25:58.500,"The maid was unfortunately ugly
and from a humble background."
00:25:58.000,00:26:00.270,所以皇上一直不喜欢她,,,
00:26:00.880,00:26:02.670,把她扔在行宫里待产,00:25:59.177,00:26:04.020,"So His Majesty never liked her
and left her at the resort during her pregnancy."
00:26:03.720,00:26:05.510,这个女人也是命苦啊,,,
00:26:05.800,00:26:08.670,生产那日竟然难产而死,00:26:04.809,00:26:09.822,"Adding to her misfortune,
the maid died right after giving birth to her son."
00:26:09.600,00:26:10.870,只留下四阿哥,00:26:10.614,00:26:12.614,So the Fourth Prince was all alone.
00:26:12.640,00:26:15.510,后来四阿哥一直养在圆明园,00:26:13.815,00:26:17.160,"That is why the Fourth Prince
has always been kept in the Summer Palace?"
00:26:17.200,00:26:18.470,眼不见为净,00:26:18.280,00:26:20.400,"""When the eyes don't see, the mind is at peace."""
00:26:19.520,00:26:20.580,多谢姐姐教诲,00:26:20.600,00:26:22.560,I am grateful for Your Highness's advice.
00:26:21.520,00:26:24.750,时候不早了 赶快回席吧,00:26:22.800,00:26:26.127,It's time that we should return.
00:26:40.200,00:26:43.710,皇上 东西臣妾已经备下了,00:26:41.349,00:26:44.989,"Your Majesty, I have prepared the lots for drawing."
00:26:44.160,00:26:45.910,既然惠妹妹有孕在身,,,
00:26:46.360,00:26:48.030,这抓阉行令的差事,,,
00:26:48.360,00:26:50.310,不如就让臣妾来做吧,00:26:45.140,00:26:51.600,"Since Lady Vertu is pregnant,
why don't I cast lots on her behalf?"
00:26:50.680,00:26:53.510,怎么 你这个出主意的人,,,
00:26:53.840,00:26:54.870,自己倒不上了,00:26:51.800,00:26:56.080,"You are the one who proposed the idea.
Now you don't want to participate?"
00:26:55.240,00:26:57.870,臣妾身无所长 只会打个珠络玩,00:26:56.426,00:26:59.189,"I'm afraid I'm not talented in anything
other than making bead tassels."
00:26:58.120,00:26:59.630,实在难登大雅之堂,,,
00:27:00.200,00:27:01.510,臣妾已经想好了,00:26:59.189,00:27:01.189,"It's nothing worth displaying in ""the hall of grand elegance."""
00:27:02.840,00:27:05.220,诸位姐妹 无论大家表演什么,00:27:01.520,00:27:03.600,I've thought about it:
00:27:05.680,00:27:08.550,嫔妾都奉送一串珠络以表示心意,00:27:04.002,00:27:10.260,"No matter what my sisters perform,
I will make a bead tassel to show my appreciation."
00:27:09.640,00:27:11.670,皇上您说这样可好啊,00:27:10.637,00:27:13.160,Does Your Majesty approve?
00:27:12.760,00:27:16.630,虽是偷懒 勉强倒也算得过了,00:27:13.890,00:27:17.951,"That's you being lazy, but I shall let it pass."
00:27:19.880,00:27:20.630,真有趣,,,
00:27:21.040,00:27:23.270,久闻宫中娘娘各有所长,00:27:20.000,00:27:22.300,"Aiya, how interesting."
,,,00:27:22.400,00:27:25.000,We've all heard that every concubine in the palace is talented.
00:27:23.800,00:27:27.750,今天可要大开眼界了,00:27:25.100,00:27:29.260,Seeing that for myself will open my eyes.
00:27:28.920,00:27:32.030,那么不如皇后娘娘先请吧,00:27:30.443,00:27:33.300,"May we have the honor to have
Your Majesty to be our first presenter?"
00:27:32.400,00:27:33.790,你是小寿星的额娘,,,
00:27:34.320,00:27:35.750,你就帮本宫抽吧,00:27:33.460,00:27:37.100,"You are the mother of the birthday girl.
You can draw one for me."
00:27:36.560,00:27:38.510,谢皇后娘娘抬爱,00:27:38.000,00:27:39.880,I thank Your Majesty.
00:27:50.400,00:27:51.830,请皇后娘娘墨宝,,,
00:27:52.080,00:27:54.070,亲手书写一个寿字,00:27:51.604,00:27:55.500,"Your Majesty's exquisite calligraphy is requested,
to bestow on Wenyi your writing of the 夀 [longevity] character."
00:27:55.840,00:27:59.790,在这么多人面前可难为本宫了,00:27:56.820,00:28:01.060,Before so many guests... This is putting pressure on me.
00:28:01.840,00:28:04.430,皇后娘娘的书法乃是一绝,00:28:03.040,00:28:06.000,Your Majesty writes the finest calligraphy.
00:28:05.080,00:28:07.430,我瞧倒是曹贵人的手气,,,
00:28:07.680,00:28:10.270,岂能让娘娘轻易就逃过去了,00:28:06.180,00:28:11.361,"Lady Cao had great luck with her draw.
Your Majesty should not let her down."
00:28:16.320,00:28:17.510,既然是这样,,,
00:28:17.800,00:28:20.150,今天是温宜公主的生日,00:28:17.500,00:28:21.461,"All right, on Wenyi's first birthday,"
00:28:20.960,00:28:23.670,那本宫就写个寿字赠给她吧,00:28:22.080,00:28:25.100,I will write calligraphy as a gift for her.
00:28:24.840,00:28:27.220,嫔妾替温宜谢过皇后娘娘,00:28:26.200,00:28:28.500,I thank Your Majesty on Wenyi's behalf.
00:28:54.000,00:28:56.710,皇后的字越发进益了,00:28:55.374,00:28:58.014,Your calligraphy has been advancing.
00:28:58.600,00:28:59.790,小巧而已,00:28:59.839,00:29:01.349,It's nothing worth mentioning.
00:29:05.160,00:29:09.030,皇上 皇后 请恕罪,00:29:06.390,00:29:10.600,I beg Your Majesties to excuse my offense.
00:29:10.120,00:29:12.350,臣妾实在体力不支,00:29:11.553,00:29:13.680,I am feeling fatigued.
00:29:12.760,00:29:14.870,不能与大家同乐了,00:29:13.869,00:29:16.389,I cannot enjoy this joyous occasion here with you all.
00:29:16.360,00:29:18.990,你身子不适 赶紧回去躺着,00:29:17.360,00:29:20.880,You should go back and rest since you feel unwell.
00:29:19.840,00:29:21.390,朕得空便去看你,00:29:20.880,00:29:22.900,I'll visit you when I get a chance.
00:29:22.120,00:29:23.100,谢皇上,00:29:23.302,00:29:24.554,I thank Your Majesty.
00:29:30.720,00:29:32.230,娘娘虽然凤体要紧,,,
00:29:32.840,00:29:34.670,只是这么早出来,00:29:32.000,00:29:33.829,"While Your Highness's health takes priority,"
00:29:35.000,00:29:36.590,怕是会扫了皇上的兴致,00:29:33.829,00:29:37.820,leaving the banquet so early might upset His Majesty.
00:29:37.560,00:29:38.870,我若在那儿啊,,,
00:29:39.080,00:29:41.990,只怕是扫了那些唱大戏人的兴致,00:29:38.600,00:29:43.180,If I stay I will only disappoint the troupe.
00:29:43.600,00:29:46.160,我实在看不惯那些做作样子,00:29:44.566,00:29:47.300,I've seen enough acts on their pretentious stage.
00:29:46.440,00:29:48.070,眼不见心为净,00:29:47.564,00:29:49.447,"""When the eyes don't see, the mind is at peace."""
00:29:49.720,00:29:51.590,这个呢 是莞贵人的,00:29:50.700,00:29:53.100,This one is Lady Sourire's.
00:29:52.440,00:29:54.390,请作 惊鸿舞 一曲,00:29:53.522,00:29:55.749,Please perform the Dance of the Startled Swan.
00:29:56.280,00:29:59.110,皇上 莞贵人姿貌,,,
00:29:59.360,00:30:01.590,本就翩若游龙 婉若惊鸿,00:29:57.600,00:30:02.619,"Your Majesty, Lady Sourire is as graceful as a swan."
00:30:01.880,00:30:03.270,合该由妹妹一舞,00:30:03.072,00:30:04.826,The dance belongs to her.
00:30:06.160,00:30:09.190,这 惊鸿舞 由唐玄宗梅妃所创,00:30:07.300,00:30:10.358,"The dance was created in the Tang Dynasty
by Emperor Xuanzong's Consort Mei."
00:30:09.440,00:30:10.710,本已失传许久,,,
00:30:11.200,00:30:13.470,但是纯元皇后酷爱歌舞,00:30:10.660,00:30:12.263,It had been forgotten for many years.
00:30:14.000,00:30:15.550,几经寻求原舞,00:30:12.263,00:30:17.001,"But Empress Première adored dance,
and spared no effort to restore the choreography."
00:30:15.880,00:30:18.230,又苦心孤诣地加以修改,00:30:17.001,00:30:19.303,She painstakingly improved it
00:30:18.440,00:30:20.350,曾经一舞动天下,00:30:19.540,00:30:21.973,and her rendition stunned the nation.
00:30:20.920,00:30:23.300,那在宫中可是风靡一时啊,00:30:21.973,00:30:24.577,That dance became a sensation in the palace.
00:30:24.000,00:30:26.070,这 惊鸿舞 最难学习,00:30:25.197,00:30:27.200,It's very difficult to learn:
00:30:26.560,00:30:28.590,舞好了那是惊为天人,00:30:27.300,00:30:29.980,"while a good performer can move like a swan,"
00:30:29.200,00:30:32.190,舞不好那可就是东施效颦了,00:30:30.339,00:30:33.740,a poor imitator will waddle like a duck.
00:30:33.040,00:30:34.350,莞妹妹才多大呀,,,
00:30:34.760,00:30:36.430,怎能作得了惊鸿舞呢,00:30:34.000,00:30:37.960,"Lady Sourire is very young.
How can she be experienced with this dance?"
00:30:37.200,00:30:39.830,曹贵人未免也太强人所难了吧,00:30:38.302,00:30:41.400,"Lady Cao, you've assigned too demanding a task."
00:30:42.000,00:30:44.750,莞贵人天资聪颖,00:30:41.500,00:30:46.049,"Nay, Lady Sourire has an exceptional aptitude."
00:30:45.560,00:30:48.790,这 惊鸿舞 本就是女子皆能舞的,00:30:46.400,00:30:50.340,Any girl can perform the Dance of the Startled Swan.
00:30:49.600,00:30:52.630,倘若说舞得不如纯元皇后,,,
00:30:52.920,00:30:54.390,那也是在情理之中,00:30:50.764,00:30:55.580,"It is entirely understandable even if
she cannot dance as well as Empress Première."
00:30:55.040,00:30:56.790,在座的都是自家姐妹,,,
00:30:57.160,00:30:58.190,何必拘礼呢,00:30:56.077,00:30:59.498,"We are sisters in a family.
No one will be strict with her performance."
00:31:03.400,00:31:05.670,妹妹之舞实在不登大雅之堂,,,
00:31:06.000,00:31:08.070,恐怕要贻笑大方了,00:31:04.595,00:31:09.300,"I'm afraid I would only incur ridicule
for my unpresentable dancing skills."
00:31:09.040,00:31:11.750,不能跳就算了 何必勉强呢,00:31:10.177,00:31:13.280,You don't have to dance if you feel forced to.
00:31:12.360,00:31:14.030,纯元皇后之风姿,,,
00:31:14.240,00:31:17.190,想必如今是无人能够媲美一二了,00:31:13.600,00:31:18.680,"I doubt that anyone today could compare with
the poise of Empress Première."
00:31:17.920,00:31:19.950,华妃这话倒是激将了,00:31:18.800,00:31:21.220,"Your words are provocative, Consort Fleur."
00:31:20.360,00:31:21.830,若是莞妹妹不跳,,,
00:31:22.200,00:31:25.150,那便扫了曹贵人和惠贵人的颜面,00:31:21.551,00:31:26.440,"If Lady Sourire declines, she will make
Lady Cao and Lady Vertu lose face at the ceremony."
00:31:25.440,00:31:26.830,也扫了大家的兴致,,,
00:31:27.760,00:31:29.110,若是舞了,00:31:26.440,00:31:28.680,That will also disappoint our guests.
00:31:29.320,00:31:32.350,如果舞得不好 也难免落了笑话,00:31:29.019,00:31:33.529,"If she agrees to dance but cannot deliver it well,
that will bring disgrace on herself."
00:31:32.720,00:31:33.910,舞得好就罢了,,,
00:31:34.560,00:31:37.950,只是若仿了纯元皇后之舞,00:31:33.680,00:31:35.800,"And even if she dances well,"
00:31:38.880,00:31:42.070,那恐怕是对先皇后不敬了,00:31:36.000,00:31:43.600,"replicating the dance of  Empress Première
might be considered disrespectful."
00:31:43.720,00:31:47.590,皇上 臣弟在外听闻,00:31:44.920,00:31:46.516,"Your Majesty,"
00:31:47.840,00:31:50.430,皇上又得一位莞贵人,00:31:46.516,00:31:50.495,I've long heard of this Lady Sourire of yours.
00:31:50.800,00:31:54.670,才貌双全 却一舞不会,00:31:52.050,00:31:56.031,"They're saying that she is beautiful and talented,
but she can't even perform a dance."
00:31:55.520,00:31:56.310,恐怕,,,
00:31:56.520,00:31:59.670,连臣弟府内的歌舞伎都不如啊,00:31:56.774,00:32:00.795,"I'm afraid she can't even compare
to the entertainers in my estate."
00:32:00.000,00:32:03.030,这样怎能侍奉皇上啊,00:32:01.134,00:32:04.174,"How can someone like this
deserve to serve Your Majesty?"
00:32:04.360,00:32:06.110,女人无才便是德呀,00:32:04.700,00:32:05.520,"Aiya,"
,,,00:32:05.520,00:32:07.940,"""The lack of talent is a virtue for a woman."""
00:32:06.960,00:32:08.910,跳什么 惊鸿舞 啊,00:32:08.151,00:32:10.300,"Why does she have to perform
the Dance of the Startled Swan?"
00:32:09.520,00:32:12.790,只是长得赏心悦目也就是了,00:32:10.400,00:32:13.700,All she needs is to have a pretty face.
00:32:13.120,00:32:14.070,如此说来,,,
00:32:14.560,00:32:17.550,这才貌双全倒成了浪得虚名,00:32:14.189,00:32:18.989,"In that case, her reputation for beauty and talent is undeserved."
00:32:18.600,00:32:20.470,只是以色侍人,,,
00:32:21.040,00:32:24.030,更显得皇上以貌取人楼,00:32:19.718,00:32:25.118,"But earning favor with her beauty would only show
the shallowness of His Majesty's affection."
00:32:26.640,00:32:29.910,惊鸿舞 易学难精 还是不要作了,00:32:27.500,00:32:31.300,This dance is widely learned but rarely mastered.
00:32:30.760,00:32:32.030,换个别的什么的,00:32:31.839,00:32:33.534,How about we change to something else?
00:32:32.480,00:32:36.310,启禀皇上 莞妹妹素来醉心诗书,00:32:33.800,00:32:37.467,"Your Majesty, Sourire has always immersed her heart in poetry"
00:32:36.560,00:32:38.190,并不曾歌舞上用心,,,
00:32:38.440,00:32:40.430,臣妾想不如填词一首,00:32:37.656,00:32:39.400,instead of singing and dancing.
00:32:40.760,00:32:41.710,为公主贺寿吧,00:32:39.480,00:32:42.980,"I was wondering if she could compose
a poem for the princess?"
00:32:48.280,00:32:52.310,宫中许久不演 惊鸿舞,00:32:49.386,00:32:53.760,"It's been a long time since
this dance was performed in the palace."
00:32:56.120,00:32:57.670,朕倒也想看一看,00:32:57.302,00:32:59.061,I wish to see it as well.
00:32:59.400,00:33:05.310,莞贵人 你随便一舞即可,00:33:00.500,00:33:01.687,"Lady Sourire,"
,,,00:33:04.339,00:33:06.560,you can perform it however you like.
00:33:11.720,00:33:14.180,那就请容臣妾去更衣 片刻即回,00:33:13.060,00:33:15.780,"Please allow me to get changed in the side chamber.
I'll be back shortly, Your Majesty."
00:33:18.800,00:33:23.350,更衣就罢了 只要不是尿遁就好,00:33:19.839,00:33:22.226,"Using ""the side chamber"" [toilet] is certainly allowed,"
,,,00:33:22.226,00:33:24.915,as long as she's not escaping down the pit!
00:33:25.400,00:33:27.070,皇上面前别说醉话,00:33:26.500,00:33:28.680,Don't talk drunkenly before His Majesty.
00:33:33.480,00:33:35.030,小主倒也不是不会跳,,,
00:33:35.240,00:33:37.830,只是如今跳与不跳 好与不好,00:33:34.857,00:33:36.480,"It is not that you don't know the dance, My Lady."
00:33:38.440,00:33:39.630,都是骑虎难下,00:33:36.480,00:33:40.683,"But now you're sitting astride a tiger
and there's no getting off."
00:33:41.200,00:33:42.230,别人要看的,,,
00:33:42.760,00:33:44.470,哪里是宛若惊鸿的舞姿,00:33:42.298,00:33:45.858,What they want to see is not the grace of a startled swan
00:33:45.280,00:33:46.500,怕是惊弓之鸟吧,00:33:46.200,00:33:47.840,but simply a fleeing bird.
00:33:52.120,00:33:53.100,替我更衣吧,00:33:53.244,00:33:54.564,Help me get changed.
00:34:06.000,00:34:08.300,皇上 臣妾的衣服换好了,00:34:07.102,00:34:09.823,"Your Majesty, I've changed to the costume."
00:34:12.040,00:34:12.990,启禀皇上,,,
00:34:13.280,00:34:16.110,寻常的丝竹管弦太过俗气,00:34:13.220,00:34:17.180,"Your Majesty, in addition to the ordinary instruments,"
00:34:16.440,00:34:17.910,不如让臣妾抚琴,,,
00:34:18.160,00:34:20.790,安妹妹高歌一曲为莞贵人助兴吧,00:34:17.444,00:34:23.000,"may I offer to play the zither
while Lingrong sings for Lady Sourire?"
00:34:22.920,00:34:24.230,自当为姐姐效力,00:34:24.000,00:34:25.825,"With great pleasure, Sourire."
00:34:29.400,00:34:32.710,去取舒太妃的长相思琴来,00:34:30.650,00:34:34.080,"Bring here Endless Longing, the zither."
00:34:33.520,00:34:35.550,先帝舒妃进宫当日,,,
00:34:35.760,00:34:38.550,先帝特赐一琴名长相思,00:34:34.300,00:34:39.900,"When Consort Dowager Serein entered the palace,
the prior emperor gave her a gift as a symbol of love:"
00:34:39.400,00:34:42.710,一笛名长相守为定情之物,00:34:40.200,00:34:44.320,"Endless Longing, the zither
and Eternal Promise, the flute."
00:34:44.960,00:34:49.030,先帝驾崩之后舒妃自请出宫修行,00:34:46.077,00:34:50.445,"After the prior emperor passed away,
Consort Dowager Serein requested to live in a nunnery."
00:34:49.840,00:34:52.510,这一琴一笛便留在了宫中,00:34:50.720,00:34:53.940,So her zither and flute remain in the palace.
00:34:53.200,00:34:55.190,今日是你有缘,00:34:54.402,00:34:56.717,You share an affinity with this precious zither.
00:35:15.480,00:35:20.910,翩若惊鸿,00:35:16.720,00:35:22.460,Swift as a startled swan;
00:35:21.280,00:35:26.870,婉若游龙,00:35:22.600,00:35:28.060,Graceful as a spiraling dragon.
00:35:27.080,00:35:32.510,荣耀秋菊,00:35:28.300,00:35:33.660,Glorious as the autumn chrysanthemums;
00:35:33.080,00:35:38.100,华茂春松,00:35:33.900,00:35:39.500,Vibrant as the spring pines.
00:35:38.760,00:35:49.790,仿佛兮若轻云之蔽月,00:35:40.000,00:35:51.000,Like the moon thinly veiled by the wisps of clouds;
00:35:50.440,00:36:01.510,飘飘兮若流风之回雪,00:35:51.700,00:36:00.000,Like the snow softly wafted by the flutters of a breeze.
00:36:02.200,00:36:05.190,远而望之,,,
00:36:05.520,00:36:11.190,皎若太阳升朝霞,00:36:03.700,00:36:12.303,"From afar, she appeareth as the sun rising in the rosy sky;"
00:36:11.480,00:36:14.910,这一举一动莫不如纯元皇后当年,00:36:12.680,00:36:15.700,Her moves are just a replication of Empress Première's.
,,,00:36:15.840,00:36:18.700,"Nigh, she is a lotus blooming above the emerald waters."
00:36:17.400,00:36:21.470,美则美矣 毫无新意,00:36:18.800,00:36:23.080,"It's beautiful, but not at all original."
00:36:22.560,00:36:25.470,新意又如何 失了敬意才不好,00:36:23.300,00:36:26.660,It's more important to be respectful than creative.
00:38:19.600,00:38:22.950,你还有多少惊喜是朕不知道的,00:38:20.500,00:38:24.320,How many more surprises have you kept from me?
00:38:25.160,00:38:28.750,臣妾雕虫小技 让皇上见笑了,00:38:26.145,00:38:30.125,"I hope my inferior dancing did not
incur ridicule from Your Majesty."
00:38:31.960,00:38:33.910,果然舞曲精妙,00:38:33.000,00:38:35.413,That was a marvelous performance indeed!
00:38:34.200,00:38:38.310,可与本王府第一舞伎相较,00:38:35.413,00:38:39.451,It could rival the best of my household performers.
00:38:39.240,00:38:40.270,十哥错笑了,,,
00:38:41.360,00:38:43.740,莞贵人所舞尽得梅妃真传,00:38:40.164,00:38:42.300,"Tenth Brother, you made an inappropriate comparison."
00:38:44.800,00:38:46.510,当年梅妃作 惊鸿舞,00:38:42.360,00:38:45.280,"Lady Sourire performed the dance
in honor of Consort Mei's composition."
00:38:46.840,00:38:48.190,被玄宗称为梅精,00:38:45.884,00:38:50.004,"Emperor Xuanzong of Tang referred to
the dance as ""the Spirit of Mei."""
00:38:49.360,00:38:52.150,惊鸿舞 本就源起于梅妃,,,
00:38:52.640,00:38:55.020,今日小王也算是得观古意了,00:38:50.440,00:38:55.700,"Today, I am fortunate to have admired
the long-lost grace of Consort Mei."
00:38:55.360,00:38:59.270,你又无曾亲眼所见什么梅妃起舞,00:38:56.440,00:39:00.718,"You have never witnessed
Consort Mei performing the dance."
00:38:59.720,00:39:02.870,你哪来的这些言之凿凿啊,00:39:00.718,00:39:04.000, How can you speak so certainly?
00:39:04.080,00:39:06.710,习武骑射我自然不能和十哥相较,00:39:05.060,00:39:08.344,"Tenth Brother, while I cannot compare to you
in archery or martial arts,"
00:39:07.360,00:39:08.710,唯独这些史书,,,
00:39:09.480,00:39:11.030,我这个闲人倒是比十哥,00:39:08.502,00:39:13.478,I did idle my years away reading more books of history.
00:39:11.360,00:39:12.340,略多读了一些,,,
00:39:12.720,00:39:16.070,我满人以骑射得天下,00:39:13.800,00:39:17.080,We Manchus conquered the country with archery.
00:39:16.400,00:39:20.590,找这么多臭墨史书有什么用啊,00:39:17.457,00:39:21.646,"What is the use of the ""stinking ink on history books""?"
00:39:21.080,00:39:23.990,无非是因为你生母是汉人,,,
00:39:24.200,00:39:27.070,所以教了你一肚子的汉人腔调,00:39:22.453,00:39:28.060,"You're so full of the Han people's talk
because your mother is Han."
00:39:27.280,00:39:33.430,我大清需要的是文武双全的人才,00:39:28.200,00:39:34.620,Our country needs masters of both pen and sword.
00:39:34.720,00:39:38.070,两位皇弟都是朕的左膀右臂,00:39:35.918,00:39:42.000,"Brothers are like the fingers of one hand.
Everyone has his own strengths and weaknesses."
00:39:38.960,00:39:43.630,各有所长 何必一较长短呢,00:39:42.346,00:39:45.020,Don't compare length with breadth.
00:39:48.080,00:39:50.990,皇上看臣妾说得如何,00:39:49.140,00:39:52.320,"Like I said earlier, Your Majesty,"
00:39:51.560,00:39:53.550,莞贵人果然聪慧,,,
00:39:53.800,00:39:55.870,能作寻常人不能作之舞,00:39:52.702,00:39:57.620,"Lady Sourire is so talented to have mastered
an extraordinary dance."
00:39:56.840,00:39:57.950,想必这舞姿,,,
00:39:58.400,00:40:00.630,也不逊于当年的纯元皇后吧,00:39:57.951,00:40:02.091,I believe her dance is not beneath that of Empress Première.
00:40:07.280,00:40:10.710,本宫记得纯元皇后作此舞的时候,,,
00:40:11.160,00:40:13.350,连华妃都还没入王府,00:40:08.389,00:40:14.540,"If I recall correctly, not even Consort Fleur had entered
the family when Empress Première performed the dance."
00:40:13.920,00:40:16.070,更何况是曹贵人你了,00:40:15.202,00:40:17.702,"Not to mention you, Lady Cao."
00:40:18.440,00:40:21.910,你又如何知道纯元皇后之舞如何,00:40:19.652,00:40:23.060,How could you possibly know how well Empress Première danced?
00:40:22.160,00:40:24.190,你又怎么拿莞贵人之舞,,,
00:40:24.480,00:40:25.540,与之相较呢,00:40:23.300,00:40:26.900,And how can you compare it to Lady Sourire's dance?
00:40:27.760,00:40:30.830,是臣妾冒失了 臣妾也只是耳闻,00:40:28.866,00:40:32.200,"I hope Your Majesty will forgive my offense.
I have only heard of the stories."
00:40:31.200,00:40:32.870,不能得见故皇后之舞姿,,,
00:40:33.160,00:40:34.220,是臣妾之憾,00:40:32.300,00:40:35.480,"It is my eternal regret to not
have seen the dance of the late empress."
00:40:36.720,00:40:39.100,跳了那么久了 累不累,00:40:37.640,00:40:40.140,Do you feel tired after all the dancing?
00:40:40.360,00:40:41.230,臣妾不累,,,
00:40:42.760,00:40:44.910,臣妾未曾见纯元皇后,00:40:41.300,00:40:42.900,"I'm all right, Your Majesty."
00:40:45.160,00:40:46.630,作 惊鸿舞 的绝妙风采,00:40:43.820,00:40:49.700,"I did not have Heaven's blessings to admire
the splendid dance of the late empress."
00:40:47.080,00:40:48.430,实在是臣妾福薄,,,
00:40:49.680,00:40:51.350,臣妾今日所作 惊鸿舞,,,
00:40:51.640,00:40:55.340,是拟梅妃之态的旧曲 萤烛之辉,00:40:50.826,00:40:54.700,"My performance today was an imitation
of Consort Mei based on her music composition."
00:40:55.920,00:40:58.270,怎能与纯元皇后的明月之光相较,00:40:55.304,00:41:00.184,"My dance to that of Empress Première
is what candlelight is to the moon."
00:41:08.280,00:41:13.110,十七弟 来迟了 可得罚酒三杯,00:41:09.466,00:41:14.520,"Seventeenth Brother, you must punish yourself
with three cups of wine for your late arrival."
00:41:14.160,00:41:15.830,臣弟刚刚已经作了一曲,,,
00:41:16.320,00:41:17.830,为新嫂歌舞助兴,00:41:15.260,00:41:19.280,"I have just played the flute to accompany
the dancing of your new concubine."
00:41:18.880,00:41:20.950,皇兄怎么也要看在新嫂的面子上,,,
00:41:21.280,00:41:22.190,放臣弟一马,00:41:20.000,00:41:23.720,"Imperial Brother, you must not punish me on her account."
00:41:23.320,00:41:24.750,长相思的笛音,,,
00:41:25.040,00:41:27.630,必得配得上长相守的琴音,,,
00:41:28.000,00:41:30.230,才称得上是无双之妙,00:41:24.680,00:41:31.500,"Eternal Promise, the flute comes into
divine harmony with Endless Longing, the zither."
00:41:32.440,00:41:35.190,这是莞贵人甄氏,00:41:33.573,00:41:36.993,This is Noble Lady Sourire from the Zhen family.
00:41:37.240,00:41:39.670,这是惠贵人沈氏,00:41:38.601,00:41:41.261,This is Noble Lady Vertu from the Shen family.
00:41:44.440,00:41:45.950,唱歌的是,00:41:45.360,00:41:47.160,And the singer is ...
00:41:49.640,00:41:50.950,臣妾答应安氏,00:41:50.200,00:41:52.020,I'm the Companion from the An family.
00:41:51.160,00:41:51.910,赏,00:41:52.020,00:41:53.000,You're rewarded.
00:41:54.720,00:41:56.670,你坐朕身边,00:41:55.811,00:41:58.700,"You, come sit next to me."
00:41:57.920,00:41:58.710,谢皇上,00:41:59.040,00:42:00.820,I thank Your Majesty.
00:42:06.160,00:42:07.350,十七哥终于来了,,,
00:42:07.800,00:42:08.630,来 坐坐坐,00:42:07.041,00:42:10.369,"Seventeen Brother, you've finally shown up.
Sit next to me!"
00:42:13.040,00:42:14.910,华妃 你是怎么了,00:42:14.120,00:42:16.520,"Consort Fleur, what is the matter with you?"
00:42:15.760,00:42:18.510,这么好的日子 你干嘛要扫兴啊,00:42:16.897,00:42:20.000,Why would you spoil the mood on such a joyous day?

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."

like flowers swept away in the wind."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
