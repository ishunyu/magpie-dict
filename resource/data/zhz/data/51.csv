00:02:22.260,00:02:23.670,真是个聪明的女人,00:02:23.360,00:02:24.713,What a clever woman.
00:02:25.350,00:02:28.810,你知道对聪明的女人,00:02:26.550,00:02:27.520,Do you know...
,,,00:02:28.503,00:02:29.979,what I would do...
00:02:30.060,00:02:30.930,我会怎么样,00:02:31.000,00:02:32.243,to a clever woman?
00:02:32.860,00:02:33.560,杀了我,00:02:34.000,00:02:35.000,You'd kill me?
00:02:34.730,00:02:37.440,可惜准噶尔人不杀救命恩人,00:02:35.800,00:02:37.440,"Unfortunately, the Dzungars would never"
,,,00:02:37.440,00:02:38.640,kill someone who saves them.
00:02:40.110,00:02:41.820,我根本就没想杀你,00:02:41.310,00:02:43.020,I have no intention of killing you.
00:02:43.410,00:02:44.610,聪明的女人,00:02:44.610,00:02:45.812,A clever woman
00:02:45.740,00:02:47.150,同时具有美貌,00:02:46.720,00:02:48.480,who is beautiful at the same time...
00:02:49.710,00:02:52.290,是很容易叫人喜欢的,00:02:50.720,00:02:53.480,can easily be an object of desire.
00:02:52.880,00:02:53.620,这位仁兄,00:02:53.880,00:02:54.880,"Sir,"
00:02:54.380,00:02:55.870,你的言辞过分了,00:02:55.400,00:02:56.880,your remarks are out of line.
00:02:58.380,00:03:01.170,我们准噶尔人喜欢的东西,00:02:59.580,00:03:00.960,We Dzungars...
00:03:01.720,00:03:02.750,就是喜欢,00:03:01.313,00:03:03.950,are not shy about what we like.
00:03:04.260,00:03:05.420,不仅仅喜欢,00:03:05.400,00:03:06.733,"When we fancy a thing,"
00:03:06.680,00:03:09.670,还要想方设法地得到它,00:03:07.800,00:03:10.760,we do everything we can to acquire it.
00:03:17.280,00:03:17.980,别忘了,00:03:18.360,00:03:19.360,Don't forget...
00:03:18.780,00:03:20.520,这是我们大清的山河,00:03:19.800,00:03:21.875,This is the land of the Great Qing.
00:03:30.830,00:03:31.620,有一天,00:03:31.773,00:03:33.068,The day may come
00:03:33.040,00:03:35.280,也可以是我们准噶尔人的土地,00:03:34.092,00:03:36.640,when this land becomes the territory of the Dzungars.
00:03:39.460,00:03:40.920,我们刚刚救了你,00:03:40.480,00:03:42.195,We saved your life just now.
00:03:41.970,00:03:43.380,自然也可以杀了你,00:03:43.040,00:03:44.800,But we can kill you just as easily.
00:03:45.430,00:03:46.340,就凭你,00:03:46.520,00:03:47.540,Can you?
00:03:48.220,00:03:49.380,还没那么容易吧,00:03:49.200,00:03:50.560,It wouldn't be so easy.
00:03:50.980,00:03:54.140,你们大清国从前好歹有个年羹尧,00:03:52.180,00:03:55.340,"In the past, at least your country had Nian Gengyao."
00:03:55.560,00:03:56.600,可现如今,00:03:56.720,00:03:58.000,"But now,"
00:03:57.770,00:03:59.810,连一个可用的将才都没有,00:03:58.800,00:04:01.120,you don't have a single competent general.
00:04:01.780,00:04:03.770,你连一个散兵游勇都不如,00:04:02.980,00:04:04.970,You're less capable than a runaway soldier.
00:04:06.160,00:04:07.990,我还未必放在眼里,00:04:07.320,00:04:09.155,I don't think you're worthy of my concern.
00:04:08.740,00:04:09.610,那是你幸运,00:04:09.720,00:04:10.720,You're lucky
00:04:11.540,00:04:12.530,因为你有伤,00:04:12.640,00:04:14.524,because I will not harm an injured man.
00:04:19.050,00:04:19.660,大人,,,
00:04:20.590,00:04:21.750,大人 大人,00:04:20.160,00:04:21.160,Sir!

00:04:25.680,00:04:26.460,大人,00:04:24.460,00:04:25.450,Sir! Sir!
00:04:26.720,00:04:28.430,您您让我们找得好辛苦啊,00:04:26.720,00:04:27.720,Sir!
00:04:29.100,00:04:30.010,发生什么事了,00:04:27.920,00:04:29.630,It was so hard to find you.
00:04:31.140,00:04:31.880,刚才,00:04:30.160,00:04:31.210,What happened?
,,,00:04:32.280,00:04:33.280,I was...
00:04:33.270,00:04:34.930,我在山上被蛇咬伤了,00:04:34.400,00:04:36.130,bitten by a poisonous snake up the hill.
00:04:36.560,00:04:38.470,幸好他们救了我,00:04:37.760,00:04:39.560,Luckily they saved me.
00:04:43.400,00:04:45.860,多谢这位公子 还有两位姑娘,00:04:44.480,00:04:45.799,"Thank you very much, sir,"
00:04:46.570,00:04:47.440,救了我们大人,00:04:46.013,00:04:47.310,"and the two ladies,"
00:04:48.280,00:04:49.270,这位大人以后出门,00:04:47.571,00:04:48.715,for saving My Lord.
00:04:49.530,00:04:50.440,还是小心点为好,00:04:49.240,00:04:51.518,You should be more careful going out in the future.
00:04:51.240,00:04:53.450,说不定下次就不能像今日一样,00:04:52.440,00:04:53.476,"The next time,"
00:04:53.790,00:04:54.780,安然无恙地离去了,00:04:53.476,00:04:55.760,you might not be so lucky to leave unscathed.
00:04:56.460,00:04:58.160,你倒为我打算得清楚,00:04:57.660,00:04:59.360,That's very caring of you.
00:04:58.960,00:05:01.250,自然因为我看得出来,00:05:00.000,00:05:01.000,"It may seem so,"
00:05:01.550,00:05:03.000,尊驾是爱惜性命的人,00:05:01.200,00:05:04.000,but only because you value your own life.
00:05:04.720,00:05:06.000,按你们的话说,00:05:05.800,00:05:07.222,To use a phrase from your language ...
00:05:07.640,00:05:09.250,你倒是我半个知音了,00:05:08.640,00:05:10.583,you could be considered almost a soul mate of mine.
00:05:10.890,00:05:12.550,尊驾夸我是半个知音,00:05:12.000,00:05:13.750,"You said that as a compliment,"
00:05:13.060,00:05:14.720,可我只盼再也不见到您的尊容,00:05:14.000,00:05:15.680,but it will be my life-long fortune
00:05:14.980,00:05:16.010,就是毕生大幸了,00:05:15.720,00:05:17.280,to never again see your lordly face.
00:05:16.900,00:05:17.850,尊驾请自便吧,00:05:17.920,00:05:18.920,Please suit yourself.
00:05:22.320,00:05:23.520,来 来 大人,00:05:23.520,00:05:24.600,"Here, master."
00:05:24.110,00:05:25.850,来 大人 走,00:05:25.310,00:05:26.800,"Let's go, master."
00:05:26.490,00:05:28.070,慢点啊来,00:05:27.480,00:05:28.480,Be careful.
00:05:29.490,00:05:30.360,好,,,
00:05:32.370,00:05:33.070,谢了,00:05:32.200,00:05:33.200,Good.
,,,00:05:33.400,00:05:34.400,Thank you.
00:05:35.580,00:05:36.490,大人 慢点 慢点,00:05:36.520,00:05:37.520,Take it slow.
00:05:42.550,00:05:43.330,走吧,00:05:43.750,00:05:44.720,Let's go.
00:05:50.050,00:05:51.340,你怎么抱了那么多书来,,,
00:05:51.680,00:05:52.340,从哪儿来的,00:05:51.200,00:05:52.520,Why did you bring so many books?
,,,00:05:52.520,00:05:53.623,Where are they from?
00:05:53.140,00:05:56.470,是我斗胆向王爷要了一些书来,00:05:54.340,00:05:57.520,I boldly asked His Lordship for some books.
00:05:56.850,00:05:58.680,今日他遣阿晋送过来的,00:05:57.800,00:05:59.600,He sent Ajin to deliver these today.
00:05:59.270,00:06:01.640,我平日里有那几本书解闷就够了,00:06:00.320,00:06:02.840,"It is enough for me to read
my few books for leisure."
00:06:02.070,00:06:03.930,你怎么还问他要那么多书来呢,00:06:03.120,00:06:05.000,Why did you ask him for so many?
00:06:05.150,00:06:06.610,小姐教我读书好不好,00:06:06.350,00:06:07.810,"My Lady, can you teach me literary classics?"
00:06:08.660,00:06:09.440,你不是向来,,,
00:06:09.740,00:06:10.950,不爱在诗书上用心的吗,00:06:09.860,00:06:12.000,But you've never been interested in poetry and prose.
00:06:11.530,00:06:13.190,如今怎么倒肯学了,00:06:12.520,00:06:14.240,What changed your mind?
00:06:14.660,00:06:16.820,我多懂一点诗书不好吗,00:06:15.860,00:06:17.920,Isn't it good for me to know more about literature?
00:06:17.830,00:06:19.240,小姐一向爱这些,,,
00:06:19.750,00:06:21.030,要是我也多懂一点,00:06:19.030,00:06:20.560,"My Lady, you've always had a passion for reading."
00:06:21.460,00:06:22.950,就能陪小姐解解闷了,00:06:20.950,00:06:22.400,"If I can understand literature better,"
00:06:24.550,00:06:25.960,小姐现在有了王爷,00:06:22.606,00:06:24.371,I can help relieve your boredom.
00:06:26.670,00:06:28.330,自然和神仙眷侣一样,00:06:25.750,00:06:27.490,"My Lady, you have His Lordship now,"
,,,00:06:27.720,00:06:29.778,and you two are like a couple in a fairy tale.
00:06:29.380,00:06:31.120,难道就不许我再陪伴了,00:06:30.400,00:06:32.200,But can't I keep you company as well?
00:06:33.510,00:06:34.590,你别跟我摆道理,,,
00:06:35.310,00:06:36.010,我问你,00:06:34.520,00:06:35.889,Don't sidestep the real issue.
00:06:36.730,00:06:38.260,前两日我和他和诗,00:06:36.320,00:06:37.403,"Let me ask you,"
00:06:38.850,00:06:40.090,你在后面听到了是不是,00:06:37.800,00:06:39.560,"when I was composing poetry with him a few days ago,"
,,,00:06:39.800,00:06:41.290,"you heard us, didn't you?"
00:06:43.110,00:06:44.390,小姐既然猜到了,00:06:44.310,00:06:45.600,"Since you have figured me out,"
00:06:45.320,00:06:46.730,那我也就不再隐瞒了,00:06:46.440,00:06:47.720,I won't hide it anymore.
00:06:49.200,00:06:50.860,小姐和王爷懂得那么多,00:06:50.400,00:06:51.920,"My Lady, you and His Lordship are so knowledgeable"
00:06:51.570,00:06:53.030,又成日地对答如流,00:06:52.560,00:06:54.240,and fluently hold intelligent conversations all day.
00:06:54.030,00:06:55.190,我却什么也不懂,00:06:55.000,00:06:56.638,Yet I don't understand anything.
00:06:56.490,00:06:59.110,那日又听小姐和王爷,00:06:57.640,00:06:58.640,The other day...
00:06:59.580,00:07:00.820,和诗和得那么好,00:06:58.880,00:07:02.020,"when I heard how beautifully
you two composed poetry together,"
00:07:02.000,00:07:03.160,我就觉得自己,,,
00:07:03.380,00:07:04.910,像根木头似的杵在那儿,00:07:03.000,00:07:05.880,I stood as dumb as a piece of wood.
00:07:05.460,00:07:06.450,羞也羞死了,00:07:06.480,00:07:07.885,I couldn't be more ashamed.
00:07:08.170,00:07:10.760,你愿意上进自然是再好不过了,00:07:09.370,00:07:11.960,Wishing to improve oneself is a most desirable trait.
00:07:11.260,00:07:12.210,只要你愿意学,,,
00:07:12.800,00:07:14.460,我也有千万个情愿肯教你,00:07:12.310,00:07:13.760,"As long as you're willing to learn,"
,,,00:07:13.760,00:07:15.685,I'm always happy to teach you.
00:07:15.850,00:07:16.960,只是女孩子家,00:07:16.880,00:07:18.366,It's just that...
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.300,诗书看多了懂得多了,00:07:18.366,00:07:20.526,"the more a woman reads and learns,"
00:07:19.810,00:07:22.470,只怕忧愁烦恼也会多上许多,00:07:20.800,00:07:23.670,the more melancholy and wistful she may feel.
00:07:23.270,00:07:26.390,那也总比无知无觉的好,00:07:24.280,00:07:25.600,But that's still better
,,,00:07:26.080,00:07:27.590,than being ignorant and senseless.
00:07:46.290,00:07:48.250,快请你们小主出来接旨吧,00:07:47.400,00:07:49.720,"Please request My Lady to come out
to receive His Majesty's decree."
00:07:48.590,00:07:49.370,苏公公,00:07:49.720,00:07:50.720,"Mr. Su,"
00:07:49.800,00:07:51.750,您可不知道这位小主子的性子,00:07:50.880,00:07:52.920,you don't know My Lady's personality.
00:07:52.050,00:07:53.630,她是桀惊不驯的那一种啊,00:07:52.920,00:07:54.720,She's intractable like an untamed horse.
00:07:54.090,00:07:56.340,您想啊现在正是她驯马的时候,00:07:55.160,00:07:57.400,She's training a horse right now.
00:07:57.060,00:07:58.970,她是断然不肯出来的,00:07:58.000,00:08:00.000,She will definitely not come out.
00:07:59.470,00:08:00.550,您要是在这儿等啊,,,
00:08:00.890,00:08:02.350,一等就是两三个时辰,00:08:00.560,00:08:01.750,"If you wait for her here,"
,,,00:08:01.880,00:08:03.520,it could be four to six hours.
00:08:02.890,00:08:04.810,那岂不误了您的大事吗,00:08:03.880,00:08:06.000,Can your task be delayed so long?
00:08:05.860,00:08:06.770,我的姑奶奶,00:08:06.400,00:08:07.800,My goodness!
00:08:07.020,00:08:08.810,她拖得起 我可拖不起呀,00:08:08.000,00:08:09.840,"She can afford to wait, but I can't."
00:08:09.190,00:08:10.900,得紧赶着去伺候皇上呢,00:08:10.160,00:08:11.920,I need to get back to attend to His Majesty.
00:08:11.190,00:08:13.190,苏公公我知道您怕马,00:08:12.120,00:08:13.120,"Mr. Su,"
,,,00:08:13.120,00:08:14.400,I know you're afraid of horses...
00:08:13.700,00:08:16.060,您放心这马性子虽野,00:08:14.800,00:08:15.800,But don't worry —
00:08:16.700,00:08:17.860,可有小主在,00:08:15.800,00:08:17.360,"even though the horse is wild by nature,"
,,,00:08:17.680,00:08:19.280,it definitely won't hurt you
00:08:18.450,00:08:20.530,它是断然不会伤您的,00:08:19.520,00:08:21.614,while My Lady is present.
00:08:22.660,00:08:25.280,皇上啊您怎么好上这一口了呢,00:08:23.600,00:08:26.320,"Your Majesty, why have you taken a liking to this one?"
00:08:28.590,00:08:31.120,小主您终于出来接旨了,00:08:29.640,00:08:32.320,"My Lady, you've finally come
to receive His Majesty's decree."
00:08:31.840,00:08:32.580,有话就说吧,00:08:32.880,00:08:34.004,Say what you have to.
00:08:34.010,00:08:34.870,皇上有旨,00:08:35.120,00:08:36.326,By His Majesty's decree...
00:08:40.020,00:08:41.100,小主对不住,,,
00:08:41.680,00:08:42.920,你得跪下接旨,00:08:41.120,00:08:42.300,"I apologize, My Lady,"
,,,00:08:42.560,00:08:44.083,but you must kneel to receive the decree.
00:08:47.900,00:08:50.140,奉天承运 皇帝诏曰,00:08:49.100,00:08:51.340,"By the Grace of Heaven, His Majesty decrees:"
00:08:50.650,00:08:53.110,圆明园叶氏 敏慧聪雅,00:08:51.546,00:08:54.310,"“Ye from the Summer Palace has
a keen intellect and an elegant manner."""
00:08:53.320,00:08:55.780,着封为答应迁入宫中居住,00:08:54.320,00:08:57.000,"""She is awarded the title of Companion
and will be relocated to the palace."""
00:08:56.160,00:08:57.070,钦此,00:08:57.160,00:08:58.201,This is His Majesty's edict.
00:09:06.250,00:09:08.540,小主您得谢恩哪,00:09:07.360,00:09:08.360,"My Lady,"
00:09:10.460,00:09:11.080,谢恩,00:09:08.440,00:09:09.740,you need to thank His Majesty.
00:09:13.510,00:09:14.540,恭喜叶小主,00:09:11.480,00:09:12.480,Thanks.
00:09:15.380,00:09:16.590,您可真有福气呀,00:09:14.560,00:09:15.864,"Congratulations, Lady Ye."
00:09:17.090,00:09:18.330,向来宫女册封,00:09:16.480,00:09:17.790,How fortunate you are!
00:09:18.680,00:09:20.460,都是由官女子而起呀,00:09:18.160,00:09:21.480,Palace servants usually start from the rank of Escort.
00:09:20.680,00:09:22.800,您看您这一跃就成为答应了,00:09:21.600,00:09:23.800,But you've leapt to the rank of Companion.
00:09:24.270,00:09:25.350,这福气给你要不要啊,,,
00:09:25.850,00:09:26.890,小主您开玩笑了,00:09:25.120,00:09:26.680,Do you want this kind of fortune?
00:09:27.150,00:09:27.980,您开玩笑了,00:09:26.680,00:09:28.040,"My Lady, you must be joking!"
,,,00:09:28.040,00:09:29.080,Must be joking!
00:09:29.230,00:09:31.720,您就赶紧收拾收拾入宫吧,00:09:30.430,00:09:32.920,Please pack up and get ready for the move.
00:09:33.940,00:09:34.770,入宫后我住哪儿,,,
00:09:35.110,00:09:36.440,内务府自有安排,00:09:34.920,00:09:36.370,Where will I live in the palace?
00:09:36.820,00:09:38.530,内务府安排是内务府的事,00:09:36.370,00:09:37.640,The Household Department will take care of it.
00:09:39.320,00:09:40.230,皇上既然喜欢我,00:09:37.920,00:09:40.000,The Household Department has their own work to do.
00:09:40.580,00:09:41.690,干吗要让内务府插手啊,00:09:40.294,00:09:41.440,"Since His Majesty likes me,"
00:09:42.870,00:09:44.110,我生性不喜欢热闹,00:09:41.440,00:09:43.247,"why would he let the Household Department
arrange this for me?"
00:09:44.750,00:09:45.990,还请公公告诉皇上,00:09:43.960,00:09:45.310,I don't like noise.
00:09:46.620,00:09:48.280,给我安排个清静远人的地方,00:09:45.680,00:09:47.190,Please tell His Majesty
,,,00:09:47.400,00:09:49.600,to settle me in a remote and quiet place.
00:09:49.040,00:09:51.450,是皇上是一定会安排的,00:09:49.960,00:09:50.995,"Yes,"
00:09:51.880,00:09:53.620,小主您赶紧入宫吧,00:09:50.995,00:09:52.691,His Majesty will certainly arrange that for you.
00:09:54.420,00:09:56.130,还得去向皇上谢恩呢,00:09:52.920,00:09:54.820,"My Lady, please hurry."
00:09:57.930,00:09:59.090,我是等不到他来了,00:09:55.480,00:09:57.280,You still need to thank His Majesty in person.
00:09:59.760,00:10:01.250,我还答应他表演给他看呢,00:09:59.000,00:10:00.800,I won't be able to wait until he comes.
00:10:01.970,00:10:03.550,小主您说的是谁呀,00:10:00.800,00:10:02.560,I promised him a performance.
00:10:03.930,00:10:04.760,你管我说谁,00:10:03.000,00:10:04.400,"My Lady, who are you talking about?"
,,,00:10:04.920,00:10:06.000,None of your business.
00:10:13.570,00:10:14.680,你看这条鱼,00:10:14.680,00:10:15.760,Look at this fish.
00:10:15.030,00:10:16.810,眼睛长得都突出来了,00:10:16.000,00:10:17.880,Its eyes are bulging out.
00:10:18.990,00:10:19.730,这条好看,,,
00:10:21.030,00:10:22.150,给太后请安,00:10:20.000,00:10:21.124,This one looks pretty.
00:10:22.580,00:10:23.530,给皇后请安,00:10:22.120,00:10:24.720,"Peace to Your Majesty the Empress Dowager.
Peace to Your Majesty the Empress."
00:10:24.200,00:10:25.240,给齐妃请安,00:10:25.156,00:10:26.440,Peace to Your Highness Concubine Astuce.
00:10:26.290,00:10:26.900,起来吧,,,
00:10:27.160,00:10:27.950,谢太后,00:10:27.320,00:10:28.320,Rise.
,,,00:10:28.320,00:10:29.320,I thank Your Majesty.
00:10:30.630,00:10:32.910,非叫你忙里偷闲地来这儿一趟,00:10:31.640,00:10:34.205,I appreciate you taking time from your busy schedule.
00:10:33.550,00:10:34.410,奴才不敢,00:10:34.600,00:10:35.610,It's my pleasure.
00:10:35.050,00:10:36.960,事情是悄悄地办,00:10:36.250,00:10:38.284,"Although arrangements have been made discreetly,"
00:10:37.970,00:10:40.550,可是迟早要住在一个宫里,00:10:39.000,00:10:41.641,she will be living in a palace sooner or later.
00:10:41.800,00:10:44.420,皇上打量着能瞒哀家多久啊,00:10:43.040,00:10:45.484,How long did the Emperor think he could hide it from me?
00:10:46.850,00:10:49.590,哀家问你新人进宫了吗,00:10:47.840,00:10:48.912,"Let me ask you,"
,,,00:10:49.520,00:10:50.958,has the new concubine entered the palace?
00:10:50.770,00:10:53.060,什么新人哪怎么臣妾不知道啊,00:10:51.720,00:10:52.926,What new concubine?
,,,00:10:52.926,00:10:54.384,Why don't I know about it?
00:10:54.480,00:10:56.810,皇帝觉得你贤德好性子,00:10:55.600,00:10:58.010,"Because of your high virtue and gentle temperament,"
00:10:57.280,00:10:58.980,只有赞成没有反对的,00:10:58.200,00:11:00.160,the emperor believes that you would never oppose him.
00:10:59.700,00:11:01.690,所以什么人都敢往宫里拉,00:11:00.760,00:11:03.284,"So he has no scruples about bringing
any woman into the palace."
00:11:03.580,00:11:04.660,太后别生气,00:11:04.720,00:11:06.025,"Please don't be angry, Your Majesty."
00:11:05.450,00:11:07.740,只不过是身份微贱些罢了,00:11:06.320,00:11:08.840,She might be coming from a humble background.
00:11:08.290,00:11:09.990,就像从前妙音娘子,,,
00:11:10.120,00:11:12.460,那样的下人一样也就是了,00:11:09.280,00:11:13.400,"Just like Lady Melodic, who was a palace servant."
00:11:13.130,00:11:16.210,再不济就和从前八爷的娘一样,00:11:14.200,00:11:15.200,"At worst,"
00:11:16.500,00:11:19.120,是辛者库贱奴而已,00:11:15.200,00:11:20.235,she could be a slave like the mother of Lord VIII.
00:11:19.470,00:11:20.830,辛者库贱奴,,,
00:11:21.090,00:11:22.880,好歹也是个官奴的后人,00:11:20.440,00:11:24.126,"Even a member of the slave caste
was born to slaves who served officials."
00:11:24.430,00:11:25.670,皇上这回挑的,,,
00:11:26.060,00:11:27.720,可是个多才多艺的,00:11:25.440,00:11:28.927,The Emperor chose a multitalented woman this time -
00:11:28.470,00:11:32.180,圆明园里百骏园驯马的丫头,00:11:29.600,00:11:33.323,a horse trainer from the stables in the Summer Palace.
00:11:33.560,00:11:34.550,回太后的话,00:11:34.720,00:11:35.808,"Your Majesty,"
00:11:35.400,00:11:36.760,这会儿人已经进宫了,00:11:36.400,00:11:38.080,she has already entered the palace.
00:11:37.780,00:11:39.770,为着还在圆明园不能进宫,00:11:38.800,00:11:40.970,His Majesty was concerned about her day and night
00:11:40.030,00:11:42.060,皇上日里夜里牵挂个不住,00:11:41.000,00:11:43.200,while she was still in the Summer Palace.
00:11:42.530,00:11:44.770,封了个答应就叫住进宫了,00:11:43.560,00:11:46.166,"So His Majesty granted her the rank of Companion
and moved her to the palace."
00:11:45.700,00:11:46.660,定了住哪儿吗,,,
00:11:47.080,00:11:47.690,还没有,00:11:46.800,00:11:48.209,Has it been decided where to place her?
00:11:48.410,00:11:50.030,不过叶答应自己说了,00:11:48.209,00:11:49.080,Not yet.
,,,00:11:49.520,00:11:51.520,But Companion Ye has told me that
00:11:50.500,00:11:53.360,说喜欢住在清静人少的地方,00:11:51.768,00:11:54.571,she prefers a quiet and secluded place.
00:11:54.290,00:11:55.080,你们听听,,,
00:11:55.790,00:11:57.080,人才刚进宫,00:11:55.240,00:11:56.452,Listen to this.
00:11:57.340,00:11:58.830,就知道要这个要那个,00:11:56.880,00:11:59.720,"She is making demands even before
 moving into the palace!"
00:11:59.630,00:12:00.420,就是,,,
00:12:01.260,00:12:02.870,皇上说了给她哪儿了吗,00:12:00.760,00:12:01.760,Exactly.
00:12:03.130,00:12:04.340,内务府得等个两天,00:12:02.360,00:12:04.332,Has the emperor made a decision on her residence?
00:12:04.720,00:12:06.000,才能把宫室打扫出来,00:12:04.332,00:12:06.920,"The Household Department needs several days
to clean and prepare the rooms."
00:12:06.300,00:12:09.050,皇上说先叫住在养心殿的偏殿,00:12:07.360,00:12:10.320,"His Majesty said she could live in the side chamber
of the Hall of Mental Cultivation for now."
00:12:09.350,00:12:10.090,那怎么成,00:12:10.320,00:12:11.320,That can't happen!
00:12:12.940,00:12:13.890,去告诉皇上,00:12:14.040,00:12:15.200,You tell the emperor that
00:12:14.730,00:12:17.390,寿康宫后头春禧殿还空着,00:12:15.800,00:12:18.320,"the Hall of Spring Joy behind the
 Palace of Longevity is unoccupied."
00:12:17.860,00:12:19.640,立刻叫人打扫出来给她住,,,
00:12:19.780,00:12:20.360,是,00:12:18.840,00:12:20.800,Have it cleaned for her immediately.
00:12:20.650,00:12:21.560,春禧殿给她,00:12:20.800,00:12:21.680,Yes.
00:12:22.400,00:12:23.980,那不是太台举她了,00:12:21.680,00:12:22.885,The Hall of Spring Joy?
,,,00:12:23.480,00:12:25.248,How could she deserve such an honor？
00:12:24.660,00:12:25.490,自然不会,00:12:25.680,00:12:26.720,Of course she does.
00:12:26.410,00:12:27.860,像现在的情势,00:12:27.520,00:12:29.163,"Based on the current situation,"
00:12:28.580,00:12:30.910,只怕还会有的晋封啊,00:12:29.720,00:12:32.000,"I'm afraid that she will receive
more promotions in the future."
00:12:32.410,00:12:33.490,她喜欢清静,00:12:33.400,00:12:34.855,"Since she likes peace and quiet,"
00:12:34.080,00:12:36.540,没有比寿康宫一带更清静的了,00:12:35.120,00:12:37.480,there's no quieter area than the Palace of Longevity.
00:12:37.000,00:12:39.370,就让她住在哀家眼皮子底下,00:12:38.080,00:12:40.520,I'll have her live under my nose
00:12:40.000,00:12:42.000,也不怕她翻出什么花样来,00:12:41.000,00:12:43.200,in case she plays any tricks.
00:13:01.190,00:13:02.680,免了免了 坐下,00:13:02.280,00:13:03.396,There is no need.
,,,00:13:03.396,00:13:04.360,Sit down.
00:13:10.160,00:13:12.150,怎么不高兴,00:13:11.160,00:13:12.364,What's wrong?
00:13:13.580,00:13:15.070,是不是住着不习惯哪,00:13:12.640,00:13:13.640,Are you upset?
00:13:16.000,00:13:16.950,住哪里都这样,00:13:14.720,00:13:16.477,Are you still not used to living here？
00:13:18.920,00:13:19.950,来了几天了,00:13:17.000,00:13:18.449,I'm like this wherever I live.
00:13:20.550,00:13:21.880,朕都没看你笑过,00:13:19.880,00:13:21.315,"You've been here for days,"
,,,00:13:21.600,00:13:23.126,but I haven't seen you smile once.
00:13:23.590,00:13:25.000,若是觉得宫里拘谨,00:13:24.680,00:13:26.600,"If you feel constrained by life in the palace,"
00:13:25.470,00:13:28.250,朕得空就带你去圆明园住些日子,00:13:26.600,00:13:29.280,"I'll take you to the Summer Palace
for a visit when I have time."
00:13:28.550,00:13:29.630,皇上忙于朝政,00:13:29.480,00:13:31.280,Your Majesty is busy with state affairs.
00:13:30.600,00:13:31.840,不必为我烦心,00:13:31.680,00:13:33.120,There is no need to worry about me.
00:13:33.430,00:13:34.640,而且我不笑,00:13:34.630,00:13:35.880,"Besides, I don't smile..."
00:13:35.730,00:13:37.340,是我生性就不爱笑,00:13:36.800,00:13:38.645,because it is not in my nature.
00:13:40.190,00:13:41.100,并不为别的,00:13:41.278,00:13:42.484,There is no other reason.
00:13:46.650,00:13:48.390,其实你不笑更好看,00:13:47.800,00:13:50.000,You look even more beautiful when you're not smiling.
00:13:51.450,00:13:52.160,娘娘,,,
00:13:52.540,00:13:53.270,皇上就这么,00:13:52.400,00:13:53.640,"Your Majesty,"
00:13:53.660,00:13:54.870,封了一个低等的丫头做答应,00:13:53.640,00:13:56.080,"His Majesty really promoted
a low-born girl to Companion?"
00:13:57.250,00:13:59.990,皇后娘娘祖制宫女晋封,00:13:58.200,00:13:59.283,"Your Majesty,"
00:14:00.590,00:14:02.000,也得从官女子起呀,00:13:59.800,00:14:01.724,"according to the ancestors' rules,"
00:14:02.500,00:14:03.870,叶澜依不是宫女,00:14:01.724,00:14:03.560,a maid in the palace should be promoted to Escort first.
00:14:04.090,00:14:05.330,更何况皇上喜欢,00:14:03.560,00:14:05.070,Ye Lanyi was not a maid.
00:14:05.760,00:14:06.920,有什么不可以的,00:14:05.080,00:14:06.720,"Besides, His Majesty likes her."
,,,00:14:06.720,00:14:08.165,There is nothing wrong with it.
00:14:07.430,00:14:09.880,前天晌午晋封晚月善侍宴,00:14:08.404,00:14:09.920,"The promotion ceremony was before noon,"
00:14:10.180,00:14:11.880,晚上就送进养心殿侍寝,00:14:09.920,00:14:11.320,"she then accompanied His Majesty for dinner,"
,,,00:14:11.320,00:14:13.166,and served His Majesty that very night.
00:14:12.560,00:14:14.800,这几日里皇上就只让她侍寝,00:14:13.640,00:14:16.251,"In the past few nights, His Majesty
has requested service only from her."
00:14:15.390,00:14:17.470,臣妾从来没见过皇上这个样子,00:14:16.480,00:14:18.720,I have never seen His Majesty acting this way.
00:14:17.850,00:14:19.890,你没见过本宫也没见过,00:14:18.926,00:14:21.006,You haven't? Neither have I.
00:14:20.230,00:14:21.970,这才叫鬼迷心窍,00:14:21.240,00:14:23.203,"This is what's called ""possessed by the devil""."
00:14:22.650,00:14:24.510,今日臣妾进养心殿请安,00:14:23.760,00:14:25.880,"Today, when I went to the Hall of
 Mental Cultivation to pay my respects,"
00:14:24.940,00:14:26.520,却看清了叶答应的长相,00:14:25.880,00:14:27.844,I had a good look at Companion Ye.
00:14:27.280,00:14:29.110,那做派张扬粗野,00:14:28.360,00:14:30.393,Her attitude was arrogant and her manners rough.
00:14:29.570,00:14:31.360,不知道皇上究竟喜欢她什么,00:14:30.640,00:14:32.444,I can't fathom what His Majesty likes about her.
00:14:32.200,00:14:33.910,祺嫔妹妹要是有本事,00:14:33.320,00:14:35.323,"Délice, if you are capable,"
00:14:34.740,00:14:36.450,也弄出这种做派来,00:14:35.800,00:14:37.644,you can adopt her manners.
00:14:36.950,00:14:38.320,皇上照样喜欢,00:14:37.920,00:14:39.768,Then His Majesty would favor you just the same.
00:14:40.630,00:14:43.490,叶氏如此得宠真让人心惊,00:14:41.760,00:14:43.606,Ye has gained so much favor ...
00:14:44.420,00:14:46.130,要是哪天生个下贱胚子,00:14:43.606,00:14:44.931,It makes my heart quiver.
00:14:46.460,00:14:47.330,还不知道怎么样呢,00:14:45.480,00:14:47.280,If she gives birth to a low-born scum someday ...
,,,00:14:47.280,00:14:48.528,I can't imagine.
00:14:48.050,00:14:50.460,要是老天保佑她不会生就好了,00:14:49.120,00:14:51.680,It would be a blessing from Heaven if she is barren.
00:15:39.020,00:15:39.760,叶答应,00:15:40.000,00:15:41.083,Companion Ye.
00:15:42.730,00:15:43.430,十七爷,00:15:43.720,00:15:44.720,Lord XVII.
00:15:45.980,00:15:46.690,你来了,00:15:47.076,00:15:48.246,You're here.
00:15:47.480,00:15:49.770,许久未见已经是答应了,00:15:48.480,00:15:50.000,It's been a long time since we last met.
,,,00:15:50.000,00:15:51.404,You've become a Companion now.
00:15:54.280,00:15:55.770,谁也没问过我愿不愿意,00:15:55.400,00:15:57.044,No one ever asked if I was willing
00:15:56.830,00:15:57.570,我就进了宫,,,
00:15:58.660,00:15:59.530,又成了答应,00:15:57.840,00:15:59.127,"to be sent to the Palace,"
,,,00:15:59.760,00:16:01.088,or to become a Companion.
00:16:02.170,00:16:03.370,我听说了你的事情,00:16:03.240,00:16:04.806,I heard about what happened to you.
00:16:04.460,00:16:05.570,你似乎心灰意冷,00:16:05.560,00:16:06.770,You seem dispirited.
00:16:07.000,00:16:08.370,这里的一切都脏得很,00:16:08.120,00:16:09.653,Everything here is filthy.
00:16:09.920,00:16:11.750,还是我的百骏园最干净,00:16:11.040,00:16:13.559,No place feels as pure as the stables at the Hundred Stallion Pavillion.
00:16:16.930,00:16:17.960,你还记得那一年吗,,,
00:16:18.680,00:16:19.760,你高热垂危的事,00:16:17.980,00:16:19.366,Do you remember that year
00:16:20.730,00:16:21.380,记得,00:16:19.780,00:16:21.404,when you almost died from a high fever?
00:16:22.890,00:16:23.970,那是七年前,00:16:21.840,00:16:22.840,I remember.
00:16:24.730,00:16:25.840,我病得快要死了,00:16:24.000,00:16:25.406,It was seven years ago.
00:16:26.480,00:16:28.470,没有人理会像我这样卑贱的奴婢,00:16:25.800,00:16:27.206,I was so sick and about to die.
00:16:29.230,00:16:30.810,是王爷无意中见到了我,00:16:27.560,00:16:29.724,Nobody cared about a humble servant like me.
00:16:31.570,00:16:32.600,让太医救了我,00:16:30.320,00:16:32.175,"But, by chance, Your Lordship saw me"
00:16:33.280,00:16:34.060,我当初救你,00:16:32.640,00:16:34.165,and asked an imperial doctor to save me.
00:16:34.740,00:16:35.570,可不是想看到,00:16:34.360,00:16:35.890,I didn't save you back then
00:16:35.910,00:16:37.020,今日自暴自弃的你呀,00:16:35.890,00:16:38.220,to see you abandoning yourself to despair now.
00:16:37.580,00:16:38.820,可是我又能怎样呢,00:16:38.580,00:16:40.226,But what else can I do?
00:16:39.790,00:16:41.280,想去的地方不能去,00:16:40.880,00:16:42.524,I can't be where I want to be.
00:16:42.460,00:16:43.440,让我待着的地方,00:16:43.400,00:16:45.120,The place I'm forced to live -
00:16:44.120,00:16:46.710,令我念心让人绝望,00:16:45.120,00:16:47.880,it disgusts me and destroys my hopes.
00:16:48.710,00:16:49.790,你要先保护好自己,00:16:49.800,00:16:51.073,You have to protect yourself first.
00:16:50.920,00:16:52.160,我印象中的叶澜依,00:16:52.020,00:16:53.400,The Ye Lanyi I remember
00:16:52.630,00:16:54.460,笑容美好性格坚毅,00:16:53.480,00:16:55.640,has a resilient personality with a radiant smile.
00:16:54.760,00:16:57.300,哪怕再苦她都会寻得一点甜蜜,00:16:55.640,00:16:57.200,"No matter how bitter her life was,"
00:16:57.600,00:16:58.510,让自己高兴起来,00:16:57.200,00:16:59.600,she could find sweetness within it and cheer herself up.
00:17:02.730,00:17:03.840,当年的恩情,00:17:03.760,00:17:05.512,I haven't been able to repay Your Lordship
00:17:04.980,00:17:06.470,我一直不能报答王爷,00:17:05.760,00:17:07.600,for your kindness years ago.
00:17:07.860,00:17:09.720,既然王爷要我好好活着,00:17:08.960,00:17:11.089,"Since Your Lordship encourages me to cherish life,"
00:17:10.530,00:17:11.730,我一定听王爷的话,00:17:11.440,00:17:13.125,I surely will listen to you.
00:17:13.440,00:17:14.150,太好了,00:17:14.640,00:17:15.640,Excellent.
00:17:18.570,00:17:19.230,嬛儿,00:17:19.560,00:17:20.560,Huan’er.
00:17:22.290,00:17:23.370,你怎么突然就来了,,,
00:17:24.000,00:17:25.080,外面的事情一忙完,00:17:23.320,00:17:24.776,Why did you come so suddenly?
00:17:25.410,00:17:26.400,我就急着赶过来见你,00:17:25.060,00:17:26.360,"As soon as I finished my duties outside,"
00:17:27.420,00:17:28.160,前几日,00:17:26.360,00:17:27.889,I hurried here to see you.
00:17:28.540,00:17:30.160,我不是说我心里面不安吗,00:17:28.620,00:17:29.621,"A couple days ago,"
00:17:31.250,00:17:31.790,我想到了,00:17:29.640,00:17:31.529,"I said I was feeling troubled, remember?"
00:17:32.210,00:17:33.250,让我们彼此都心安的东西,00:17:32.240,00:17:34.488,"I came up with an idea that could
put both of us at ease."

00:18:00.120,00:18:00.900,又是罪妇,00:17:59.180,00:18:00.800,I was abandoned by your brother
00:18:01.910,00:18:03.120,前途尚未可知,00:18:01.120,00:18:02.656,and my family was disgraced.
00:18:04.000,00:18:05.110,你又何需如此呢,00:18:03.000,00:18:04.525,My future is still uncertain.
,,,00:18:05.000,00:18:06.360,You don’t need to do this.

00:21:10.100,00:21:13.060,西藏发生阿尔布巴之乱,00:21:11.300,00:21:14.160,Ngabo Dorje Gyalpo mounted a rebellion in Tibet.
00:21:15.520,00:21:17.480,意图投奔准噶尔部,00:21:16.520,00:21:18.400,He intends to ally with the Dzungars.
00:21:19.440,00:21:21.930,虽然颇罗草自动起兵平叛,00:21:20.640,00:21:23.378,"Although Polhané has mobilized troops
 to suppress the rebellion,"
00:21:22.900,00:21:23.940,但是朕以为,00:21:24.000,00:21:25.203,I believe
00:21:25.780,00:21:27.650,准噶尔部落一日不靖,00:21:26.880,00:21:29.006,that not until the Dzungar tribes are quelled
00:21:28.530,00:21:29.990,西藏事一日不妥,00:21:29.480,00:21:31.413,will Tibet be stable.
00:21:31.540,00:21:33.950,西藏事料理不能妥协,00:21:32.600,00:21:34.920,"Tibetans won't come to terms,"
00:21:34.460,00:21:36.160,众蒙古心怀疑二,00:21:35.400,00:21:37.200,and the Mongolian tribes harbor treachery.
00:21:36.710,00:21:39.920,这二处是为国家隐忧,00:21:37.680,00:21:38.852,These two regions...
,,,00:21:39.080,00:21:40.800,are a lurking concern for our country.
00:21:41.300,00:21:43.500,朕虽然设立了驻藏大臣,00:21:42.500,00:21:44.768,"I appointed imperial residents to govern Tibet,"
00:21:44.670,00:21:48.010,也筹划着用兵准噶尔部,00:21:45.800,00:21:46.993,and I'm planning to...
,,,00:21:47.440,00:21:49.391,deploy troops against the Dzungars.
00:21:49.390,00:21:51.590,可是尚有许多未清之事,00:21:50.590,00:21:52.970,"Even so, many things are still unclear."
00:21:52.850,00:21:55.180,需要你走一趟滇藏查探,00:21:54.050,00:21:56.488,"I need you to go to Yunnan and Tibet
to gather more information."
00:21:55.770,00:21:57.050,皇兄虽然有心嘱托,00:21:56.800,00:21:58.160,"I'm honored to be trusted by Your Majesty,"
00:21:57.940,00:21:58.970,可是臣弟不才,00:21:58.960,00:22:00.501,but I’m not qualified for the task.
00:22:01.270,00:22:02.350,朕要用你,00:22:02.470,00:22:03.674,I assigned this to you
00:22:03.780,00:22:06.560,是因为你在朝政上牵扯不多,00:22:04.920,00:22:07.760,because you’re less entangled in the court.
00:22:08.070,00:22:09.480,如果微服前往,00:22:09.082,00:22:10.640,"If you go there in plain clothes,"
00:22:09.700,00:22:12.160,因为认识你的人少也好办事,00:22:10.680,00:22:13.428,"it's easier to probe around
as few people can recognize you."
00:22:12.790,00:22:14.070,如今滇藏一带,00:22:13.760,00:22:15.602,"These days, in Yunnan and Tibet,"
00:22:15.080,00:22:16.990,多的是准噶尔部的细作,00:22:16.000,00:22:17.860,there are many Dzungar spies.
00:22:17.410,00:22:19.200,朕也怕打草惊蛇,00:22:18.480,00:22:20.970,"I don't want to ""beat the grass and startle the snakes""."
00:22:20.380,00:22:21.210,另一则,00:22:21.400,00:22:22.524,There is another reason.
00:22:22.290,00:22:25.250,如果万一对准噶尔部用兵,00:22:23.420,00:22:24.600,"If by any chance,"
,,,00:22:24.759,00:22:26.657,"we use military force against the Dzungars,"
00:22:26.800,00:22:29.260,从甘肃云南调兵最快,00:22:27.737,00:22:30.400,"moving troops from Gansu and Yunnan
would be the fastest."
00:22:30.430,00:22:31.920,舒太妃是云南人,00:22:31.500,00:22:33.238,Consort Dowager Serein is from Yunnan.
00:22:33.060,00:22:36.590,由你顺道走一趟滇藏也最合适,00:22:34.130,00:22:37.600,You're the most appropriate person to visit the region.
00:22:39.770,00:22:40.810,臣弟虽然不才,,,
00:22:41.310,00:22:42.600,但皇兄既然嘱托了,00:22:40.840,00:22:42.206,"I may have little talent,"
00:22:42.900,00:22:43.680,自然不能推脱,00:22:42.380,00:22:45.053,"but since Your Majesty has entrusted me
 with this responsibility, I must abide."
00:22:45.480,00:22:46.560,臣弟一定尽力,00:22:46.565,00:22:48.001,I will do my best.
00:22:48.240,00:22:48.900,好,00:22:49.240,00:22:50.240,Good.
00:22:49.910,00:22:52.770,那你就收拾一下早去早回,00:22:50.980,00:22:52.720,Then go prepare for the trip.
,,,00:22:52.720,00:22:54.493,"The sooner you leave, the sooner you can return."
00:22:56.330,00:22:57.240,臣弟告退,00:22:57.360,00:22:58.605,I shall take my leave.
00:23:04.630,00:23:05.330,苏培盛,00:23:05.652,00:23:06.640,Su Peisheng.
00:23:09.380,00:23:10.000,皇上,00:23:10.280,00:23:11.280,Your Majesty.
00:23:11.340,00:23:13.050,传张廷玉大人过来,00:23:12.410,00:23:14.240,Summon Mr. Zhang Tingyu here.
00:23:13.600,00:23:14.210,嘛,00:23:14.725,00:23:15.720,Yes.
00:23:24.230,00:23:26.560,臣给皇上请安,00:23:25.197,00:23:27.680,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:23:29.610,00:23:30.320,起来吧,00:23:30.600,00:23:31.600,Please rise.
00:23:36.080,00:23:37.110,朕宣你来,00:23:37.160,00:23:38.400,I summoned you here
00:23:38.410,00:23:41.070,就是为了果郡王前往滇藏一事,00:23:39.560,00:23:42.140,"to discuss Noble Prince Guo's trip
to Yunnan and Tibet."
00:23:42.290,00:23:45.780,你要派可靠的人暗中小心保护,00:23:43.360,00:23:46.850,"You need to send reliable people
to protect him carefully and covertly."
00:23:46.590,00:23:47.330,同时,00:23:47.560,00:23:48.560,"Also,"
00:23:48.380,00:23:51.840,也需防着果郡王干政过多,00:23:49.450,00:23:52.883,"to prevent Noble Prince Guo from
unduly interfering with state affairs."
00:23:52.890,00:23:53.800,他每到一地,00:23:53.800,00:23:55.045,"Wherever he goes,"
00:23:54.680,00:23:57.340,和谁说话做了些什么,00:23:55.600,00:23:56.920,"whoever he talks to,"
,,,00:23:57.240,00:23:58.410,"whatever he does,"
00:23:58.060,00:24:00.800,都要察看清楚及时回报,00:23:59.000,00:24:00.796,must be carefully observed
,,,00:24:00.796,00:24:02.778,and reported back in a timely manner.
00:24:02.230,00:24:02.840,是,00:24:03.300,00:24:04.280,Yes.
00:24:14.870,00:24:15.600,温太医,00:24:15.720,00:24:16.720,Dr. Wen.
00:24:16.780,00:24:17.520,药都好了吗,00:24:17.720,00:24:18.885,Is the formula ready?
00:24:20.910,00:24:21.530,好了,00:24:21.800,00:24:22.883,"Yes, it is."
00:24:28.800,00:24:29.910,用的时候小心些,00:24:29.838,00:24:30.948,Be careful when using it.
00:24:33.090,00:24:33.710,多谢,00:24:33.880,00:24:34.880,Thank you.
00:24:35.140,00:24:35.970,别谢我,00:24:36.000,00:24:37.083,Don't thank me.
00:24:37.300,00:24:39.720,我只是怕嬛儿身陷苦海,00:24:38.370,00:24:41.120,"I just don't want Huan'er
to suffer in an abyss of misery."
00:24:42.100,00:24:42.930,还是多谢你,00:24:43.000,00:24:44.253,I still want to thank you.
00:24:56.200,00:24:57.560,你下马怎么那么不小心,00:24:57.120,00:24:58.722,"Why were you so careless
when dismounting the horse?"
00:24:58.410,00:25:00.320,好好的斗篷就给割破了一块,00:24:59.400,00:25:01.428,Now there is a hole in your cloak.
00:25:01.040,00:25:02.570,我想着四日都没来见你了,00:25:02.110,00:25:03.600,"I haven't seen you for four days,"
00:25:03.160,00:25:04.240,下马就特别着急,00:25:04.174,00:25:05.384,so I rushed off the horse.
00:25:05.460,00:25:07.160,一件衣服嘛不值什么,00:25:06.360,00:25:07.600,"It's only a cloak,"
00:25:08.170,00:25:09.450,雪天山路难走,00:25:07.600,00:25:08.765,nothing precious.
00:25:10.000,00:25:11.240,马蹄又容易打滑,00:25:09.200,00:25:10.843,"The mountain roads are difficult on snowy days,"
00:25:11.920,00:25:13.380,你又何必巴巴赶过来呢,00:25:11.038,00:25:12.560,and horses can easily slip.
00:25:14.630,00:25:15.870,这次是割破了衣裳,00:25:12.800,00:25:14.468,You didn't have to come here so hurriedly.
00:25:16.430,00:25:18.210,若下次弄伤了自己那可怎么好,00:25:15.720,00:25:17.146,It's your cloak this time.
00:25:19.050,00:25:20.540,你是存心让我不放心是吗,00:25:17.400,00:25:19.360,"But the next time, you could hurt yourself."
00:25:20.850,00:25:21.760,我答应你就是了,00:25:20.000,00:25:21.800,Are you deliberately trying to worry me?
00:25:22.810,00:25:24.300,其实我也不愿意伤了我自己,00:25:21.880,00:25:23.211,I promise to be careful next time.
,,,00:25:23.800,00:25:25.440,I don't want to injure myself either.
00:25:24.980,00:25:27.010,若把自己伤了怎么来看你呢,00:25:25.960,00:25:27.260,"If I was injured,"
,,,00:25:27.260,00:25:28.648,how could I come to see you?
00:25:28.730,00:25:29.810,油嘴滑舌,00:25:29.760,00:25:30.880,Such a glib tongue.
00:25:33.240,00:25:34.520,若下次再弄破了衣裳,00:25:34.310,00:25:35.673,"If your clothes are torn again,"
00:25:34.950,00:25:36.440,谁还巴巴地给你补衣裳,00:25:35.840,00:25:37.893,there won't be anyone to mend them for you.
00:25:37.870,00:25:39.860,随便你穿一件破衣裳满街逛去,00:25:38.880,00:25:41.044,I don't care if you walk around in tattered clothes.
00:25:44.120,00:25:45.280,明日就要走了吗,00:25:45.080,00:25:46.324,Are you leaving tomorrow?
00:25:46.000,00:25:48.030,十二月二十三已快正月,00:25:46.920,00:25:49.120,It's already the 23rd of the last lunar month.
00:25:48.790,00:25:49.580,不能不走了,00:25:49.720,00:25:50.720,I can't delay any longer.
00:25:49.880,00:25:51.410,左右这年是不能在京中过了,00:25:50.830,00:25:52.605,"No matter what, I can't be in Beijing for New Year."
00:25:52.130,00:25:53.340,四十天就能回来吗,00:25:53.168,00:25:54.378,You will be back in forty days?
00:25:53.670,00:25:55.210,四十天之内我一定回来,00:25:54.403,00:25:55.480,"Within forty days,"
,,,00:25:55.480,00:25:56.769,I will definitely be back.
00:25:57.090,00:25:58.050,四十天,00:25:58.040,00:25:59.040,Forty days...
00:25:59.390,00:26:00.880,月亮又圆了一回呢,,,
00:26:01.310,00:26:02.290,四十天很短的,00:26:00.360,00:26:02.080,The moon will be full once again.
00:26:03.560,00:26:04.390,我都安排好了,00:26:02.380,00:26:03.648,The days will fly by.
00:26:04.980,00:26:05.810,等我这次回来,00:26:04.520,00:26:05.960,I have everything arranged.
00:26:06.350,00:26:07.340,我就接你离开这里,00:26:05.960,00:26:07.120,"After I come back,"
00:26:07.900,00:26:08.550,真的吗,00:26:07.280,00:26:08.675,I will take you away from here.
00:26:14.610,00:26:15.400,这是,00:26:08.840,00:26:09.840,Really?
00:26:15.570,00:26:16.270,你看,00:26:15.600,00:26:16.600,This is...?
,,,00:26:16.600,00:26:17.600,Look.
00:26:22.790,00:26:23.700,像是香粉,00:26:23.720,00:26:24.800,It looks like makeup powder.
00:26:24.240,00:26:26.450,这是温太医配的假死药,00:26:25.261,00:26:26.600,Dr. Wen prepared this medicine
00:26:27.580,00:26:28.950,叫七日迷魂散,00:26:26.600,00:26:27.885, for you to feign death.
00:26:29.580,00:26:30.620,曼陀罗花制成,00:26:28.650,00:26:30.020,It's called the Seven-Day Sedate.
,,,00:26:30.462,00:26:31.886,Made from jimsonweed.
00:26:31.210,00:26:34.170,服下之后啊顿时就呼吸全无,00:26:32.280,00:26:33.337,"After taking it,"
,,,00:26:33.680,00:26:35.323,your breathing will pause
00:26:35.010,00:26:35.960,如同死人一般,00:26:35.920,00:26:37.182,as if you were dead.
00:26:36.970,00:26:39.960,七日之后就能苏醒过来,00:26:38.040,00:26:39.171,"Seven days later,"
,,,00:26:40.000,00:26:41.160,you will regain consciousness.
00:26:41.800,00:26:43.090,他终究还是肯帮我,00:26:42.800,00:26:44.320,He is willing to help me after all.
00:26:44.520,00:26:47.220,温太医的确为我们用心良苦,00:26:45.720,00:26:46.782,Dr. Wen ...
00:26:47.980,00:26:48.930,应该好好谢谢他,00:26:46.782,00:26:48.526,has put so much thought into helping us.
,,,00:26:49.000,00:26:50.405,We must thank him profusely.
00:26:51.810,00:26:52.850,我已经妥善安排好了,00:26:52.720,00:26:54.256,I have arranged everything for our plan.
00:26:53.570,00:26:54.810,等这一切全都圆满了,00:26:54.560,00:26:55.880,"After my obligations are fulfilled,"
00:26:55.690,00:26:56.430,嬛儿,00:26:56.520,00:26:57.520,"Huan'er,"
00:26:57.400,00:27:00.490,到时候我们就能永远在一起了,00:26:58.400,00:26:59.480,"at that time,"
,,,00:27:00.000,00:27:01.481,we will be together forever.
00:27:01.280,00:27:03.520,等你回来等一切事毕,00:27:02.200,00:27:03.400,When you come back
00:27:04.330,00:27:05.410,我才能真正安心,00:27:03.400,00:27:04.520,"and everything is complete,"
,,,00:27:05.240,00:27:06.770,I will truly be able to put my mind at ease.
00:27:06.830,00:27:09.120,嬛儿事关社稷,00:27:07.800,00:27:08.875,"Huan'er,"
00:27:09.870,00:27:10.660,我不能不去,00:27:09.040,00:27:10.448,this is of particular concern to the state.
00:27:12.040,00:27:13.030,四十天而已,00:27:10.800,00:27:11.883,I have to go.
00:27:13.840,00:27:14.620,我一定等你,00:27:13.080,00:27:14.120,It's only forty days.
,,,00:27:14.720,00:27:16.048,I will be here waiting for you.
00:27:19.130,00:27:21.500,从前听江南来的姨娘说,00:27:20.120,00:27:21.200,"Back in the day,"
00:27:22.470,00:27:24.300,杭州西湖边上有一座桥,00:27:21.200,00:27:22.846,an aunt from the south told me that
00:27:24.930,00:27:25.760,名叫长桥,00:27:23.600,00:27:25.500,there is a bridge by West Lake in Hangzhou.
00:27:26.970,00:27:27.800,长桥,00:27:25.920,00:27:27.000,It is called the Long Bridge.
00:27:29.940,00:27:30.800,这桥很长吗,00:27:27.920,00:27:29.124,The Long Bridge?
00:27:31.730,00:27:32.930,其实桥并不长,00:27:30.920,00:27:32.000,Is the bridge very long?
00:27:33.860,00:27:35.060,之所以叫长桥,00:27:32.760,00:27:34.040,"Actually, it is not long."
00:27:35.730,00:27:37.350,是因为当地人总说,00:27:34.920,00:27:36.160,It's called the Long Bridge
00:27:37.690,00:27:39.270,当年梁山伯与祝英台,00:27:36.720,00:27:38.480,because the local people say that
00:27:39.650,00:27:40.610,就是在此告别,00:27:38.720,00:27:40.320,Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai
00:27:41.280,00:27:42.440,依依眷恋不舍,00:27:40.400,00:27:41.883,made their farewells on the bridge.
00:27:43.200,00:27:44.690,所以原本很短的桥,00:27:42.320,00:27:43.965,"Because they were reluctant to part,"
00:27:45.080,00:27:46.060,也显得特别长了,00:27:44.160,00:27:47.000,the short bridge felt very long to cross over.
00:27:47.660,00:27:48.870,伤离别之情,00:27:48.760,00:27:50.320,The grief and sorrow of parting
00:27:49.450,00:27:51.910,古往今来都是一样的,00:27:50.320,00:27:51.720,has been the same
,,,00:27:51.920,00:27:53.120,from ancient times to now.
00:27:52.540,00:27:54.330,我才不要做什么梁山伯和祝英台,00:27:53.560,00:27:55.240,I don't want to be like them.
00:27:54.920,00:27:57.200,他们一个哭嫁一个吐血早亡,00:27:55.920,00:27:57.080,"Zhu's father betrothed her to another,"
00:27:57.750,00:27:59.210,最后只能化蝶离开人世,00:27:57.080,00:27:58.662,The news caused Liang to vomit blood and die.
,,,00:27:58.942,00:28:00.787,"Their spirits turned into butterflies
to fly away from this world."
00:28:00.260,00:28:01.670,我们比他们幸运多了,00:28:01.320,00:28:02.880,We are much luckier than them.
00:28:04.510,00:28:07.000,我真是的竟拿他们来浑比,00:28:05.400,00:28:06.737,It was a mistake ...
,,,00:28:06.737,00:28:08.000,to compare us to them.
00:28:10.060,00:28:11.390,我如今也是多心,00:28:11.080,00:28:12.480,"I'm irrationally anxious these days,"
00:28:11.890,00:28:13.100,听不得薄命之语,00:28:12.880,00:28:14.283,and can't bear to hear ill-fated stories.
00:28:15.020,00:28:16.390,可见一个男子的心肠,00:28:16.080,00:28:17.800,It is evident that once a man
00:28:17.190,00:28:18.770,若被心爱的女子所系,00:28:18.200,00:28:20.080,"holds his love dear to his heart,"
00:28:20.570,00:28:21.680,也是洒脱不起来了,00:28:21.560,00:28:22.920,he can no longer be carefree.
00:28:23.780,00:28:24.740,你自洒脱去,,,
00:28:25.700,00:28:26.980,果郡王风流惆傥,00:28:24.840,00:28:26.146,Go and be as carefree as you wish.
00:28:27.740,00:28:29.320,难道还怕没有曼妙女子,00:28:26.680,00:28:28.180,"Noble Prince Guo has always been
talented and unrestrained."
00:28:29.620,00:28:30.610,前仆后继而来吗,00:28:28.680,00:28:30.440,"There is no need to worry about
a lack of beautiful women"
,,,00:28:30.440,00:28:31.885,delivering themselves to you.
00:28:35.540,00:28:37.580,你这人真是的一说便恼,00:28:36.560,00:28:37.667,What's the matter with you?
00:28:37.920,00:28:38.830,便这样来欺负我,00:28:37.667,00:28:38.680,"I was only joking,"
00:28:39.300,00:28:40.710,真真是恼羞成怒了,00:28:38.720,00:28:39.800,yet you get so mean to me.
00:28:41.090,00:28:42.080,谁让你胡说的,00:28:40.280,00:28:41.800,You must be mad because I was right.
,,,00:28:42.080,00:28:43.324,You deserved it for talking nonsense.
00:28:47.010,00:28:48.220,陌上虽然花开,00:28:48.120,00:28:50.000,"Even though the flowers will beckon you on the road,"
00:28:49.060,00:28:50.550,但请你务必急急归来,00:28:50.000,00:28:51.600,please come back as speedily as possible.
00:28:51.520,00:28:53.970,因为我在这里等你,00:28:52.560,00:28:53.560,Because...
,,,00:28:53.800,00:28:55.124,I will be waiting for you here.
00:28:55.020,00:28:55.810,你在这儿,00:28:56.000,00:28:57.010,"With you here,"
00:28:57.730,00:28:58.850,我定归心似箭,00:28:58.720,00:29:00.408,my heart will want to return like a shooting arrow.
00:29:42.650,00:29:43.270,嬛儿,00:29:43.720,00:29:44.720,Huan'er.
00:29:49.120,00:29:49.700,嬛儿,00:29:50.120,00:29:51.120,Huan'er.
00:30:04.340,00:30:05.170,嬛儿,00:30:05.320,00:30:06.320,Huan'er.
00:30:17.020,00:30:17.800,我很快回来,,,
00:30:18.520,00:30:19.350,我等你回来,00:30:17.920,00:30:19.000,I will come back soon.
,,,00:30:19.400,00:30:20.520,I will be waiting for you.
00:30:26.070,00:30:26.770,等着我,00:30:27.000,00:30:28.000,Please do.
00:30:43.000,00:30:44.240,我等你回来,00:30:43.920,00:30:45.320,I will be waiting for you!
00:31:01.860,00:31:02.810,我等你回来,00:31:02.840,00:31:04.010,I will wait for you.
00:31:26.800,00:31:27.410,小姐,,,
00:31:28.380,00:31:30.040,您让我送到安栖观的棉袄,00:31:27.800,00:31:28.800,"My Lady,"
00:31:30.300,00:31:31.040,我已经送到了,00:31:29.480,00:31:31.840,"I have sent the winter coats to Anqi Temple
as you asked."
00:31:31.640,00:31:33.470,太妃说让我问小姐的安,00:31:32.720,00:31:34.670,Her Venerable Highness sent her regards.
00:31:33.850,00:31:35.930,还说王爷就快回来了,00:31:34.680,00:31:35.799,She also said that
00:31:36.220,00:31:37.680,到时候让王爷和小姐,00:31:35.799,00:31:37.200,His Lordship will come back soon
00:31:37.970,00:31:38.840,一同去问安呢,00:31:37.200,00:31:39.800,and you should visit her together upon his return.
00:31:39.520,00:31:42.130,这两天我懒得走动身上乏得很,00:31:40.520,00:31:42.075,I've been feeling fatigued recently
,,,00:31:42.075,00:31:43.360,and don't want to walk around.
00:31:43.150,00:31:45.430,不过顶多十日允礼就要回来了,00:31:44.120,00:31:46.520,But Yunli will be back within ten days at most.
00:31:46.110,00:31:47.770,到时候和他一起去也不迟,00:31:47.200,00:31:49.000,"I will wait for him, and visit
Her Venerable Highness together."
00:31:50.700,00:31:53.650,莫愁师太有宫中贵客来访,00:31:51.720,00:31:53.044,"Prioress Mochou,"
00:31:57.080,00:31:57.740,眉姐姐,00:31:53.160,00:31:54.885,a distinguished guest from the palace is here.
00:31:58.410,00:31:59.070,嬛儿,00:31:58.080,00:31:59.160,Meizhuang!
,,,00:31:59.480,00:32:00.480,Huan'er!
00:32:00.160,00:32:03.080,是我不好到如今才来看你,00:32:01.280,00:32:02.557,It's my fault
00:32:03.380,00:32:04.030,坐,00:32:02.557,00:32:04.200,for not visiting you until today.
,,,00:32:04.400,00:32:05.400,Let's sit down.
00:32:09.300,00:32:11.460,咱们姐妹这么多年才见一面,00:32:10.500,00:32:13.093,"Finally, we manage to
meet this once after so many years."
00:32:11.880,00:32:13.340,只一味地哭做什么,00:32:13.093,00:32:14.200,Let's cry no more!
00:32:17.810,00:32:20.510,好端端的怎么叫本宫的妹妹,00:32:19.000,00:32:20.346,"For no good reason,"
00:32:20.890,00:32:21.970,住这么偏僻的地方,00:32:20.346,00:32:23.000,"how could you place my sister
in such a remote residence?"
00:32:23.100,00:32:24.590,本宫从甘露寺过来,00:32:23.960,00:32:25.753,I came from Temple of Pure Dew
00:32:24.860,00:32:26.940,即便是坐轿也要半个时辰,00:32:25.753,00:32:27.880,and it took an hour even on the sedan.
00:32:27.570,00:32:28.980,甘露寺就是这样照顾,,,
00:32:29.320,00:32:30.560,出宫修行的娘子吗,00:32:28.544,00:32:32.140,"Is this how the temple takes care of concubines
who practice Buddhism outside the palace?"
00:32:32.400,00:32:33.810,我前段时间一直病着,00:32:33.320,00:32:35.010,"I was sick a while back,"
00:32:34.570,00:32:35.900,才搬到这儿来养病的,,,
00:32:36.490,00:32:37.700,并不干住持的事,00:32:35.480,00:32:37.010,so I moved here to recuperate.
00:32:38.080,00:32:39.190,莫愁慈悲了,00:32:37.400,00:32:39.010,It has nothing to do with Madam Abbess.
,,,00:32:39.040,00:32:40.885,"Mochou, it's very kind of you to say so."
00:32:40.330,00:32:41.070,日日日日是刀三刀三,00:32:41.280,00:32:42.280,"Yes, yes."
00:32:41.500,00:32:44.030,莫愁病了才给挪出来的,00:32:42.600,00:32:45.200,Mochou moved here because she was sick.
00:32:46.250,00:32:47.490,你们都出去候着吧,00:32:47.149,00:32:48.719,"All of you, wait outside."
00:32:48.000,00:32:49.990,本宫还有体己话要和莫愁说,00:32:48.920,00:32:51.080,I wish to speak with Mochou privately.
00:32:51.170,00:32:52.040,是,,,
00:32:52.470,00:32:53.330,旁人也就罢了,00:32:52.200,00:32:53.200,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:32:53.930,00:32:55.710,静白师太身体强壮,00:32:53.320,00:32:54.765,"Everyone can go,"
00:32:56.220,00:32:56.920,就为本宫,00:32:54.880,00:32:56.800,but Prioress Jingbai is fit and strong.
00:32:57.140,00:32:59.250,扫去回宫山路上的残雪吧,00:32:57.245,00:33:00.330,"I ask her to clear the snow off the road
to ease my return to the palace."
00:32:59.930,00:33:01.760,为表对惠嫔娘娘的这点孝心,00:33:00.920,00:33:03.000,"To show your respect for Her Highness Concubine Vertu,"
00:33:02.230,00:33:03.310,请师太独力完成,00:33:03.000,00:33:04.772,"please finish it on your own, Prioress."
00:33:05.400,00:33:06.130,是,00:33:06.480,00:33:07.480,Yes.
00:33:11.190,00:33:12.650,你何苦这样为难她呢,00:33:12.160,00:33:13.920,Why did you ask her to do that?
00:33:13.740,00:33:16.350,你在甘露寺可是受尽委屈了,00:33:14.800,00:33:17.606,You have endured so much in the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:33:18.870,00:33:19.530,并没有,,,
00:33:20.160,00:33:21.450,还这样瞒着我,00:33:19.800,00:33:20.800,Not really.
00:33:21.830,00:33:23.190,打量着我都不知道吗,00:33:21.160,00:33:22.650,You still try to hide it from me.
,,,00:33:22.800,00:33:24.448,You think I don't know?
00:33:23.830,00:33:26.570,你是从宫里被废黜了送出来的,00:33:24.880,00:33:27.520,"You were sent here after being banished
from the palace."
00:33:27.170,00:33:30.080,这世上的人哪有不是拜高踩低的,00:33:28.120,00:33:31.040,"Everyone in this world treads on those
who are lower in status."
00:33:30.420,00:33:32.710,即便是佛寺也未能免俗,00:33:31.400,00:33:33.910,"Even people in a Buddhist temple
can have worldly dispositions."
00:33:34.550,00:33:35.960,我刚才要来看你,,,
00:33:36.300,00:33:38.090,那个静白推三阻四,00:33:35.435,00:33:37.280,"When I asked to visit you just now,"
00:33:38.430,00:33:40.510,一说天冷又说路滑,00:33:37.280,00:33:39.400,"Jingbai tried hard to refuse me,"
00:33:41.060,00:33:42.970,我见了你的面才说几句话,00:33:39.400,00:33:41.645,saying the weather was cold and the road slippery.
00:33:43.270,00:33:44.430,她就心虚成那样,00:33:42.160,00:33:44.170,We barely exchanged words and
00:33:44.850,00:33:46.810,可见是平日欺负你不少,00:33:44.170,00:33:45.920,she was already showing her guilty conscience.
,,,00:33:45.920,00:33:47.965,It's obvious that she bullies you frequently.
00:33:47.730,00:33:49.520,我当着你的面发落了她,00:33:48.800,00:33:50.560,"I punished her in your presence,"
00:33:49.980,00:33:51.690,一则叫她有个教训,00:33:51.080,00:33:52.883,"not only to teach her a lesson,"
00:33:52.280,00:33:54.640,二来也不会以为是你挑峻了我,00:33:52.883,00:33:55.720,"but also to show her you weren't the one
responsible for her punishment,"
00:33:54.900,00:33:56.020,更来为难你呀,00:33:55.720,00:33:57.606,so she won't retaliate against you later.
00:33:56.950,00:33:58.230,难为你这样细心,00:33:57.920,00:33:59.485,It's very thoughtful of you.
00:33:59.160,00:34:00.320,还好还好,00:34:00.200,00:34:01.524,"It's all right, all right."
00:34:00.660,00:34:02.570,我只想着你吃足了苦头,00:34:01.720,00:34:03.560,I was worried that you suffered greatly.
00:34:03.120,00:34:04.230,又听住持说,,,
00:34:04.540,00:34:06.320,你大病一场挪出了甘露寺,00:34:04.048,00:34:07.200,"When Madam Abbess told me that you were
terribly sick and moved away."
00:34:06.870,00:34:09.360,这一路上过来我心慌得不行,00:34:07.760,00:34:10.248,I was so scared all the way here.
00:34:10.130,00:34:12.580,如今眼见了你气色既佳,00:34:11.400,00:34:13.400,"Seeing you in good health,"
00:34:13.760,00:34:15.210,我也能放心些,00:34:14.400,00:34:16.124,I feel some relief now.
00:34:18.050,00:34:19.290,听说你晋了嫔位,00:34:19.000,00:34:20.684,"I heard you were promoted
to the rank of Concubine."
00:34:20.050,00:34:21.510,我都欢喜了好几天呢,00:34:20.880,00:34:22.648,I was happy for so many days.
00:34:22.850,00:34:24.010,嫔位又如何,00:34:23.840,00:34:25.210,What's the use of that?
00:34:24.680,00:34:26.340,我未必肯放在心上,00:34:25.400,00:34:27.400,I don't care about rank or titles.
00:34:28.230,00:34:29.560,你何苦又如此呢,00:34:29.200,00:34:30.920,Why would you think like that?
00:34:31.110,00:34:32.270,皇上这两年,00:34:32.122,00:34:33.360,"For the past two years,"
00:34:32.520,00:34:34.260,像是和自己过不去一般,00:34:33.360,00:34:35.489,His Majesty has been very hard on himself.
00:34:34.820,00:34:36.480,只一味埋头于朝政,00:34:35.800,00:34:37.600,He buried himself in work.
00:34:37.320,00:34:38.280,自你走后,00:34:38.360,00:34:39.480,"Since you left,"
00:34:38.660,00:34:41.190,皇上对后宫也冷淡了许多,00:34:39.600,00:34:42.240,His Majesty has been cold towards the harem.
00:34:42.200,00:34:43.990,虽说除了祺嫔,00:34:43.400,00:34:45.190,"In addition to Concubine Délice,"
00:34:44.330,00:34:46.910,还封了一个康常在 一个贞嫔,00:34:45.200,00:34:47.880,"His Majesty has newly favored
Concubine Fidèle and Attendant Kang."
00:34:47.790,00:34:48.780,但很难说,00:34:48.760,00:34:49.920,But it is hard to tell
00:34:49.040,00:34:50.830,是真的宠爱后宫哪一个人,00:34:50.000,00:34:52.005,who he truly adores in the harem.
00:34:51.460,00:34:52.700,直到前些日子,00:34:52.440,00:34:53.760,It didn't become better until
00:34:52.960,00:34:54.620,叶答应进宫才好一些,00:34:53.760,00:34:55.885,Companion Ye entered the palace several days ago.
00:34:55.670,00:34:58.210,如今皇上对我是待之以礼,00:34:56.680,00:34:59.160,"Nowadays, His Majesty treats me
with simple courtesy."
00:34:58.930,00:35:01.790,这样也好有了嫔位的位分,00:34:59.920,00:35:01.136,It's for the best.
,,,00:35:01.320,00:35:03.040,"With the rank of Concubine,"
00:35:02.180,00:35:04.920,有些事上到底是能得力些,00:35:03.040,00:35:05.920,I can take more liberty with certain things.
00:35:05.600,00:35:07.760,芳若姑姑能常常来瞧我,00:35:06.640,00:35:09.000,Madam Orchid can often visit me -
00:35:08.350,00:35:10.090,也是因为你求太后的缘故,00:35:09.320,00:35:11.406,"because you spoke on my behalf with
the Empress Dowager."
00:35:11.310,00:35:12.680,你这样为我尽心尽力,,,
00:35:12.860,00:35:14.020,若是换了是我受苦,00:35:12.320,00:35:13.720,You have done so much for me...
00:35:14.520,00:35:15.980,你也一样这样为我的,00:35:13.720,00:35:15.080,"If I were the one suffering,"
,,,00:35:15.400,00:35:17.280,you would have done the same for me.
00:35:17.530,00:35:19.730,嬛儿我听了你的话,00:35:18.520,00:35:19.520,"Huan'er,"
00:35:20.160,00:35:21.860,这些年锋芒渐收,00:35:19.600,00:35:20.930,I took your advice
00:35:22.200,00:35:23.650,不叫皇后她们注意,00:35:21.000,00:35:22.879,"and ""blunted my sharp thorn"" in the harem"
00:35:24.370,00:35:26.450,只是一心侍奉太后,00:35:23.120,00:35:24.925,to avoid attracting the Empress’s attention.
00:35:26.790,00:35:28.320,与敬妃照顾胧月,00:35:25.570,00:35:27.800,I devoted myself to serving the Empress Dowager
,,,00:35:27.800,00:35:29.760,and taking care of Longyue with Consort Estime.
00:35:29.290,00:35:31.530,为的就是能有一日,00:35:30.360,00:35:31.400,So one day ...
00:35:31.880,00:35:33.830,可以一举帮你洗雪沈冤,00:35:31.400,00:35:34.880,"I can help redress all the injustices
done to you, in a single blow."
00:35:34.790,00:35:36.380,可奈何多少年了,00:35:35.990,00:35:37.560,"However, after so many years,"
00:35:36.670,00:35:38.660,也抓不住多少有用的把柄,00:35:37.560,00:35:39.720,I still haven’t gathered much useful evidence.
00:35:42.300,00:35:44.760,出宫不易且又在正月里,00:35:43.400,00:35:44.938,"It’s hard to get out of the palace,"
00:35:45.680,00:35:46.890,你是怎么能出来的,00:35:44.938,00:35:46.209,especially in the first lunar month.
00:35:48.850,00:35:50.760,前些日子温宜公主生病,00:35:46.680,00:35:48.205,How did you manage to come out?
00:35:51.140,00:35:52.550,虽说看了太医,00:35:49.920,00:35:51.720,Princess Wenyi fell sick several days ago.
00:35:52.900,00:35:54.260,但是宝华殿的法师,00:35:52.240,00:35:53.800,"Although the doctors have been treating her,"
00:35:54.520,00:35:55.890,说是有亡灵作祟,00:35:53.800,00:35:57.280,"the exorcist from the Baohua Hall
said she's haunted by spirits of the dead."
00:35:56.320,00:35:57.900,要把淬死妃嫔的灵才区,,,
00:35:58.280,00:35:59.770,送来甘露寺才可以,00:35:57.280,00:36:01.186,"So, we must move the caskets of any concubine
 who had a sudden demise, here to the temple."
00:36:00.450,00:36:01.980,可这样的事在正月里办,,,
00:36:02.450,00:36:03.360,终究不吉利呀,00:36:01.480,00:36:03.360,But it’s inauspicious to undertake this task
00:36:04.030,00:36:05.020,怎么交给你了,00:36:03.387,00:36:04.849,in the first lunar month.
00:36:05.990,00:36:07.030,法师说了,00:36:05.120,00:36:06.448,Why was it assigned to you?
,,,00:36:07.000,00:36:08.200,The exorcist said that
00:36:07.330,00:36:09.610,得有长久不被皇上召幸的女子,00:36:08.200,00:36:10.680,"only someone who hasn't been intimate
with His Majesty for a long time"
00:36:09.950,00:36:11.950,才能办这样身心清静的差事,00:36:10.680,00:36:13.086,"can fulfill such commitment that requires
physical and spiritual purity."
00:36:12.620,00:36:15.490,自然这样的女子也不止我一人,00:36:13.560,00:36:14.560,"Of course,"
,,,00:36:14.560,00:36:16.640,I'm not the only concubine who fits the description.
00:36:16.040,00:36:18.210,可是其他的妃嫔都嫌晦气,00:36:17.200,00:36:19.405,But other concubines considered it bad luck.
00:36:18.710,00:36:20.170,这才轮到我呀,00:36:19.680,00:36:21.280,So it fell to me.
00:36:21.340,00:36:23.380,你一向在生死之事上检点,00:36:22.400,00:36:24.486,"You have always been cautious
in matters related to death."
00:36:23.930,00:36:25.090,平日里绝不会沾染,,,
00:36:25.350,00:36:26.930,奉送亡灵超度这种事,00:36:25.000,00:36:27.880,"Normally, you would never get involved in
rituals for redeeming lost souls."
00:36:28.680,00:36:29.470,眉姐姐,00:36:29.680,00:36:30.680,"Meizhuang,"
00:36:30.390,00:36:32.130,你当真是来甘露寺超度,00:36:31.440,00:36:34.080,"did you really come to the temple
to guide these souls to the Pure Land,"
00:36:32.980,00:36:34.430,-lIR便来看我的吗,00:36:34.080,00:36:35.930,or it was an excuse to visit me?
00:36:37.860,00:36:40.720,既然你察觉了我就不瞒你了,00:36:38.920,00:36:40.400,"Given your insightfulness,"
00:36:41.610,00:36:42.570,我让温实初,00:36:40.560,00:36:42.049,I won’t hide it from you anymore.
00:36:42.820,00:36:44.860,给温宜公主下了点发热的药,00:36:42.760,00:36:44.008,I asked Wen Shichu
,,,00:36:44.008,00:36:46.006,to medicate Princess Wenyi to induce a fever.
00:36:45.320,00:36:47.150,又买通了宝华殿的法师,00:36:46.400,00:36:48.240,And I bribed the exorcist in the Baohua Hall
00:36:47.490,00:36:48.530,说起超度一事,00:36:48.240,00:36:49.560,to suggest the ritual.
00:36:49.080,00:36:51.990,这才能有机会来和你见上一面,00:36:50.080,00:36:53.000,All for having a chance to come see you.
00:36:52.330,00:36:53.160,你这样费尽心机,,,
00:36:54.000,00:36:55.530,一定是出了什么要紧的事,00:36:53.120,00:36:54.608,You went to such painstaking efforts...
00:36:56.460,00:36:57.670,是不是胧月出事了,00:36:55.080,00:36:56.765,It must be something serious.
00:36:57.920,00:36:59.500,不是不是不是胧月,00:36:57.520,00:36:58.880,Did something happen to Longyue?
,,,00:36:58.880,00:37:00.760,"No, no, not Longyue."
00:36:59.960,00:37:02.120,她很好什么事都没有,00:37:00.920,00:37:01.955,She is good.
,,,00:37:01.955,00:37:03.160,Nothing happened to her.
00:37:03.760,00:37:04.590,是,00:37:04.880,00:37:05.880,It is…
00:37:06.140,00:37:07.130,是你的父亲,00:37:07.160,00:37:08.400,It is your father.
00:37:07.680,00:37:10.340,他在富古塔病重垂危,00:37:08.760,00:37:10.249,"He fell gravely ill in Ningguta,"
,,,00:37:10.249,00:37:11.623,his life is in critical condition.
00:37:14.690,00:37:15.720,父亲好好的,00:37:15.600,00:37:16.920,My father was healthy...
00:37:17.480,00:37:18.850,怎么会病重垂危呢,00:37:18.600,00:37:20.000,How did he become gravely ill?
00:37:19.150,00:37:21.190,是伯父虽然被流放,00:37:20.040,00:37:21.000,Yes...
00:37:21.440,00:37:22.770,但身子一向都是好的,00:37:21.000,00:37:22.320,"Even though your father was exiled,"
00:37:23.700,00:37:25.190,我犹豫了好些日子,00:37:22.320,00:37:23.880,he had been in good health.
00:37:25.490,00:37:26.600,要不要来告诉你,00:37:24.680,00:37:26.320,I hesitated for days
00:37:27.570,00:37:28.860,我又怕你知道了,00:37:26.320,00:37:27.760,if I should tell you.
00:37:29.200,00:37:30.410,只会一味地伤心,00:37:28.520,00:37:29.840,I was afraid that the news would
00:37:31.240,00:37:31.950,可是,00:37:29.840,00:37:31.525,overwhelm you with sadness.
00:37:32.660,00:37:34.070,可是思前想后,00:37:32.360,00:37:33.360,But…
00:37:34.540,00:37:36.030,我担心伯父的安危,00:37:33.720,00:37:35.435,"after turning it over in my mind,"
00:37:36.620,00:37:38.580,还是忍不住要来告诉你,00:37:35.640,00:37:37.478,I am more worried for your father's life.
00:37:39.000,00:37:40.290,父亲身体康健,00:37:37.720,00:37:39.640,I had to come and tell you.
00:37:41.840,00:37:43.250,这到底是怎么回事啊,00:37:40.080,00:37:41.655,My father was perfectly healthy.
00:37:44.010,00:37:45.460,问题就出在这里,00:37:42.960,00:37:44.400,What exactly happened?
00:37:45.970,00:37:47.460,若是天意也就罢了,00:37:45.000,00:37:46.660,That's my question too.
00:37:48.340,00:37:49.500,若是人为,00:37:47.000,00:37:48.890,There is nothing we can do if it was Heaven's will.
00:37:50.180,00:37:51.890,那才真的可怕呀,00:37:49.400,00:37:51.200,But if someone deliberately harmed him ...
,,,00:37:51.200,00:37:53.006,That would be truly terrifying.
00:37:52.390,00:37:53.180,姐姐以为,00:37:53.320,00:37:54.380,Do you think...
00:37:54.560,00:37:55.920,是有人蓄意谋害,00:37:55.560,00:37:57.000,it's a premeditated act?
00:37:56.940,00:37:59.680,只怕是皇后那边使的手脚,00:37:58.040,00:38:00.640,I suspect that the Empress did something in secret.
00:38:00.480,00:38:03.190,要不就是瓜尔佳氏在外面的人,00:38:01.520,00:38:02.520,Or ...
,,,00:38:02.520,00:38:04.880,"it could be Concubine Délice‘s family -
outside of the palace."
00:38:03.820,00:38:05.430,没想到事情过了那么久,00:38:04.880,00:38:06.630,"I never thought that after all this time,"
00:38:05.950,00:38:08.060,她们还是那样地穷追不舍,00:38:06.920,00:38:08.960,they would still hound your family relentlessly.
00:38:08.950,00:38:10.650,甄氏一族流放甯古塔,00:38:09.960,00:38:11.800,The Zhen family has been exiled to Ningguta.
00:38:11.410,00:38:12.490,我也离宫修行,00:38:12.320,00:38:13.995,And I left the palace to practice in a nunnery.
00:38:13.240,00:38:15.330,她们为何要这样苦苦不肯放过,00:38:14.160,00:38:16.445,Why are they still persecuting us?
00:38:15.660,00:38:18.500,环儿现在不是难过的时候,00:38:16.760,00:38:17.777,"Huan’er,"
00:38:19.500,00:38:20.790,伯父被人暗算,00:38:17.777,00:38:19.723,now is not the time to feel aggrieved.
00:38:21.250,00:38:23.120,焉知她们下一个要对付的,00:38:20.600,00:38:21.990,Your father was plotted against.
00:38:23.460,00:38:24.290,不会是你呀,00:38:22.280,00:38:25.233,Who knows if you will be their next target?
00:38:25.130,00:38:26.420,你要赶紧想办法,00:38:26.120,00:38:27.620,You have to find a way
00:38:26.720,00:38:28.500,将伯父接回京来医治,00:38:27.620,00:38:29.480,"to bring your father back to Beijing
for medical care as soon as possible."
00:38:28.930,00:38:31.460,悉心调理或许还治得好,00:38:29.800,00:38:32.320,Perhaps he can recover with proper care.
00:38:32.350,00:38:33.090,你说得对,00:38:33.360,00:38:34.360,You are right.
00:38:34.560,00:38:35.420,为今之计,00:38:35.640,00:38:36.640,"For the time being,"
00:38:36.520,00:38:37.930,最要紧的是活着的人,00:38:37.640,00:38:39.080,his life is the most important.
00:38:39.690,00:38:40.850,为父亲医治的事,,,
