00:02:22.050,00:02:23.390,正因为是你的亲信,00:02:21.450,00:02:24.733,"It's exactly because she has your trust
that I must treat her generously."
00:02:23.890,00:02:24.880,朕才不薄待她,,,
00:02:25.640,00:02:26.720,就和你当年一样,00:02:25.040,00:02:28.160,"How about granting her the title of Attendant, just like when you entered the palace?"
00:02:27.020,00:02:28.050,封为常在如何,,,
00:02:28.940,00:02:31.020,就封为禧常在吧,00:02:28.480,00:02:30.680,I'll name her Attendant Xi [Auspicious].
00:02:33.730,00:02:34.310,奴婢不敢,00:02:33.295,00:02:34.640,"Your Majesty, I dare not ..."
00:02:35.110,00:02:36.770,奴婢怎配侍奉皇上,00:02:34.640,00:02:36.684,How could I deserve the honor of serving Your Majesty?
00:02:37.400,00:02:38.520,还请皇上饶过奴婢,00:02:36.920,00:02:38.324,I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.
00:02:39.910,00:02:40.740,这倒奇了,00:02:39.460,00:02:40.546,How strange.
00:02:41.530,00:02:43.690,寻常宫女要是有这样的荣宠,00:02:41.220,00:02:44.640,"Any maid in the palace would thank the Buddha
for receiving such favor and honor,"
00:02:43.990,00:02:45.110,早就乐得拜佛去了,,,

00:02:46.790,00:02:47.620,奴婢有罪,00:02:46.190,00:02:47.577,"I admit my offense, Your Majesty."

00:02:58.630,00:03:01.340,朕成全你们这段姻缘,00:02:58.260,00:03:00.900,"If this marriage is fated, I will decree it."

00:03:08.480,00:03:09.090,浣碧,00:03:08.060,00:03:08.900,Jade.
00:03:09.640,00:03:10.930,去阿哥所把弘瞻抱来,00:03:09.220,00:03:10.760,Bring Hongyan from the Imperial Nursery.
00:03:11.310,00:03:11.970,皇上要见他,00:03:10.760,00:03:11.780,His Majesty wants to see him.
00:03:12.190,00:03:12.800,是,00:03:11.780,00:03:12.393,Yes.
00:03:20.280,00:03:22.360,朕最喜欢看你吃醋的样子,00:03:19.800,00:03:21.873,I like to see you being jealous.
00:03:24.070,00:03:25.940,惠妃去了以后,00:03:23.660,00:03:25.580,"Since Consort Vertu passed,"
00:03:26.280,00:03:27.490,你一直心里不痛快,00:03:25.680,00:03:27.154,your heart has been heavy.
00:03:28.200,00:03:29.860,难得逗你多说几句,00:03:27.660,00:03:30.000,It’s rare to hear a few lighthearted words from you.
00:03:30.910,00:03:32.400,臣妾伤心也就罢了,00:03:30.520,00:03:32.899,My sorrow is not the most important thing.
00:03:33.960,00:03:36.000,只是若非瓜尔佳氏兴风作浪,00:03:33.500,00:03:35.599,"Gūwalgiya ""created winds and waves"" in the harem,"
00:03:36.710,00:03:39.170,眉姐姐又怎会受惊血崩,00:03:35.599,00:03:38.980,"which caused Meizhuang's prenatal shock
and then bleeding to death."
00:03:39.510,00:03:40.590,这个你不必着急,00:03:38.980,00:03:40.220,Don’t worry.
00:03:41.470,00:03:43.580,朕迟早会给你一个答复,00:03:40.940,00:03:43.131,I will respond to this in time.
00:03:44.680,00:03:45.420,但愿如此,00:03:44.260,00:03:45.313,I hope so.
00:03:47.060,00:03:48.840,否则眉姐姐在九泉之下,00:03:46.620,00:03:48.504,Or Meizhuang still won't be able to close her eyes
00:03:49.350,00:03:50.260,也不能瞑目,00:03:48.750,00:03:50.189,"""under the Yellow Springs."""
00:03:51.140,00:03:52.130,今日早朝,00:03:50.720,00:03:52.086,"At the court this morning,"
00:03:53.400,00:03:55.390,鄂敏提起朕已有四子,00:03:53.000,00:03:55.200,"Gūwalgiya Emin said since I have four sons,"
00:03:55.860,00:03:57.720,可堪择长者立为太子,00:03:55.260,00:03:57.460,"I should consider designating the eldest as Crown Prince,"
00:03:58.020,00:03:58.760,以固国本,00:03:57.460,00:03:58.540,to consolidate the nation's foundation.
00:03:59.110,00:04:00.940,说这话的就该立即廷杖,00:03:58.540,00:04:00.930,Whoever suggested that should be flogged at court immediately.
00:04:01.530,00:04:02.390,打死也不为过,00:04:00.930,00:04:02.400,Even flogging to death isn’t too harsh!
00:04:04.160,00:04:05.270,皇上春秋鼎盛,00:04:03.740,00:04:05.390,Your Majesty is in your prime.
00:04:05.990,00:04:07.570,怎么就早早论起国本来了,00:04:05.390,00:04:07.120,Why mention the nation's foundation right now?
00:04:08.370,00:04:09.280,真是不像话,00:04:07.880,00:04:09.160,That’s extremely inappropriate.
00:04:09.700,00:04:10.940,早早立为太子,00:04:09.160,00:04:10.944,Being designated as Crown Prince too early
00:04:12.080,00:04:14.160,也是早早地成为众矢之的,00:04:11.560,00:04:13.711,means being a target to all.
00:04:15.000,00:04:19.080,以致诸皇子不好好读书务政,00:04:14.520,00:04:18.660,It would encourage the princes to have their eyes upon the crown
00:04:19.800,00:04:22.580,一心都盯在太子的位子上,00:04:19.320,00:04:21.980,instead of concentrating on their studies.
00:04:23.760,00:04:26.090,且我朝向来是立贤不立长,00:04:23.420,00:04:25.980,"Furthermore, our tradition is to select
the most virtuous, not simply the eldest."
00:04:26.680,00:04:28.630,又何必在长幼上饶舌,00:04:26.080,00:04:28.445,"Why ""wag their tongues"" about their ages?"
00:04:29.600,00:04:30.210,对了,00:04:29.206,00:04:30.080,"By the way,"
00:04:30.970,00:04:32.680,近来四阿哥勤于读书,00:04:30.460,00:04:32.700,the Fourth Prince has been diligent in his studies.
00:04:33.310,00:04:34.720,皇上可问过他功课了,00:04:32.920,00:04:35.320,Has Your Majesty questioned him on his schoolwork?
00:04:36.610,00:04:39.220,也还好 还算是应对如流,00:04:36.180,00:04:38.771,He's all right. He can answer quite smoothly.
00:04:40.530,00:04:41.180,只是,00:04:40.000,00:04:41.120,"However,"
00:04:41.690,00:04:43.520,朕还是觉得咱们的孩子好,00:04:41.280,00:04:43.133,I believe our child will be better -
00:04:43.900,00:04:44.810,觉得弘瞻好,00:04:43.380,00:04:44.738,Hongyan will be even better.
00:04:45.700,00:04:48.030,说到底 皇后本是敦厚人,00:04:45.260,00:04:47.700,The Empress has a gentle heart.
00:04:48.950,00:04:50.530,何以会出此下策,00:04:48.592,00:04:52.480,"She made the unwise decision to add alum
to the water for the blood droplet test"
00:04:50.910,00:04:52.780,在滴血验亲的水中加入白矾,,,
00:04:53.160,00:04:53.900,混淆视听,00:04:52.480,00:04:53.760,"to confuse the others,"
00:04:54.750,00:04:56.860,多半是因为皇上疼爱幼子的缘故,00:04:54.300,00:04:56.913,largely because Your Majesty favors the youngest son so much.
00:04:58.040,00:04:59.910,臣妾至今想来还是后怕,00:04:57.660,00:05:00.000,"Even now, I’m frightened when I recall that day."
00:05:00.670,00:05:03.540,所以还是请皇上少疼些弘瞻吧,00:05:00.280,00:05:02.940,So I request Your Majesty be less partial to Hongyan.
00:05:04.470,00:05:07.380,皇后着急朕知道,00:05:03.960,00:05:06.940,The Empress was worried. I understand that.
00:05:08.720,00:05:10.260,弘时虽然不拔尖,00:05:08.280,00:05:10.151,"Although Hongshi isn’t outstanding,"
00:05:10.810,00:05:13.220,却也是朕的孩子 朕怎能不疼,00:05:10.320,00:05:12.700,how could I not care for him? He’s also my child.
00:05:14.850,00:05:17.760,还是早日给弘时指一门婚事,00:05:14.420,00:05:17.300,"I’d better appoint a marriage for him,"
00:05:18.520,00:05:20.390,也好让皇后安心,00:05:17.940,00:05:20.040,which may also relieve the Empress's unease.
00:05:23.690,00:05:25.650,儿子一直不敢告诉皇额娘,00:05:23.240,00:05:25.506,I haven’t yet dared tell Imperial Mother that
00:05:27.530,00:05:30.570,其实上次的事皇后也有份参与,00:05:27.240,00:05:29.970,the Empress also took part in that incident.
00:05:31.700,00:05:34.740,她甚至偷换了滴血验亲的水,00:05:31.220,00:05:34.491,"She secretly changed the water for the blood droplet test,"
00:05:35.290,00:05:37.240,想陷害贵妃和六阿哥,00:05:34.820,00:05:37.213,conspiring to frame the Noble Consort and the Sixth Prince.
00:05:37.830,00:05:39.040,不用你来告诉,00:05:37.420,00:05:38.931,You don’t need to tell me.
00:05:40.340,00:05:41.320,这些日子,00:05:39.940,00:05:40.960,"These days,"
00:05:42.000,00:05:44.210,你一步也不肯踏进景仁宫,00:05:41.400,00:05:43.760,you won't take a single step into her palace.
00:05:45.050,00:05:46.380,哀家心里就有数,00:05:44.600,00:05:46.560,"In my heart, I already ""knew the numbers."""
00:05:47.550,00:05:49.130,自从贵妃有孕回来,00:05:47.120,00:05:49.189,"Since the Noble Consort got pregnant and returned,"
00:05:50.140,00:05:51.300,别说旁人,,,
00:05:52.060,00:05:54.800,哀家心里也一直有个疑影,00:05:49.400,00:05:54.400,"even I had a shadow of misgiving in my mind,
let alone other people."
00:05:55.850,00:05:58.970,皇室的血脉必须要纯净,00:05:55.400,00:05:58.615,The imperial bloodline must be pure.
00:05:59.860,00:06:00.840,不容有失,00:05:59.322,00:06:00.900,Not a hint of doubt can be allowed.
00:06:02.690,00:06:03.900,皇后掌管六宫,00:06:02.180,00:06:03.822,The Empress manages the palace affairs.
00:06:04.230,00:06:06.350,查明此事 责无旁贷,00:06:03.822,00:06:05.750,She’s obliged to investigate.
00:06:07.360,00:06:10.070,她处理的方式是有过失,00:06:06.960,00:06:09.640,The blood testing method was at fault -
00:06:10.990,00:06:13.150,以致混进了掺了白矾的水,00:06:10.560,00:06:13.068,since the water was easily contaminated with alum -
00:06:14.080,00:06:15.740,差点冤了贵妃,00:06:13.580,00:06:15.622,and that nearly wrongly accused the Noble Consort.
00:06:16.450,00:06:18.820,而皇帝你可以怪她无能,00:06:15.960,00:06:18.480,"Emperor, you can blame her for incompetence,"
00:06:19.920,00:06:22.620,却不能怪她蓄意陷害,00:06:19.480,00:06:22.020,but you cannot accuse her of conspiracy.
00:06:24.750,00:06:25.370,是,00:06:24.150,00:06:24.959,I know.
00:06:26.340,00:06:27.370,不为别的,00:06:25.740,00:06:27.200,"Not for any other reason,"
00:06:28.590,00:06:31.800,只为了她是你最心爱人的妹妹,00:06:27.990,00:06:31.200,but because she is the sister of your most beloved.
00:06:32.850,00:06:34.590,皇帝可以信不过宜修,00:06:32.250,00:06:34.663,"You can distrust Yixiu,"
00:06:35.930,00:06:37.890,却不能信不过纯元,00:06:35.380,00:06:37.960,but you can't distrust Première.
00:06:38.940,00:06:39.470,是,00:06:38.340,00:06:39.096,True.
00:06:40.100,00:06:41.970,皇后是一国之母,00:06:39.500,00:06:41.521,The Empress is the mother of the country.
00:06:43.480,00:06:45.940,国母不安则百姓不安,00:06:42.880,00:06:45.600,The people are uneasy when the mother of the country is uneasy.
00:06:47.530,00:06:50.390,皇帝出入若不带皇后,00:06:46.930,00:06:51.509,"If the Emperor always appears
with a favored concubine instead of the Empress,"
00:06:50.860,00:06:51.770,而带宠妃,,,
00:06:53.370,00:06:55.530,宠妃就会有僭越之心,00:06:52.843,00:06:55.837,that concubine may harbor ideas of reaching beyond her station.
00:06:57.160,00:06:58.030,若有一日,,,
00:06:58.660,00:07:00.820,嫔妃凌驾于皇后之上,00:06:56.560,00:07:00.400,"If one day, a concubine rises above the Empress,"
00:07:02.670,00:07:05.700,那么后宫 以至于天下,00:07:02.070,00:07:07.721,"then the imperial harem, even the
entire country, will be in chaos."
00:07:07.010,00:07:08.290,都要大乱了,,,
00:07:10.050,00:07:10.580,是,00:07:09.450,00:07:10.206,Yes.
00:07:13.470,00:07:16.380,人之将死 其言也善,00:07:12.870,00:07:15.780,"""One's words are kinder when death is nearer."""
00:07:17.970,00:07:19.460,哀家快要不行了,00:07:17.370,00:07:19.162,I'm near the end of my life.
00:07:21.310,00:07:22.770,皇帝你要记得,00:07:20.710,00:07:23.200,"You need to remember, Emperor,"
00:07:24.480,00:07:25.770,贵妃再好,,,
00:07:26.730,00:07:29.270,皇后只有一人,00:07:24.015,00:07:28.859,"no matter how good your Noble Consort is,
there is only one Empress."
00:07:43.170,00:07:43.870,长姐,00:07:42.570,00:07:43.610,Elder Sister!
00:07:44.750,00:07:46.290,这天天往园子里逛去,00:07:44.150,00:07:47.680,"We come to the garden every day,
either to see the flowers or net butterflies."
00:07:46.630,00:07:47.960,不是赏花 就是扑蝴蝶,,,
00:07:48.300,00:07:49.410,真真无趣极了,00:07:47.700,00:07:49.565,I'm getting so bored!
00:07:53.340,00:07:54.460,这紫禁城啊,,,
00:07:54.760,00:07:56.920,别人看是天家富贵 受用不尽,00:07:52.740,00:07:56.840,"Outsiders think the Forbidden City is full of
unlimited imperial wealth and luxury."
00:07:57.680,00:07:58.800,可一进来才知道,00:07:57.080,00:07:59.836,Only insiders know there's no place more tedious
00:07:59.930,00:08:01.920,这四方的天 四面的墙,00:07:59.836,00:08:03.710,than the square-shaped sky inside these high walls.
00:08:02.390,00:08:03.980,没有比这儿更闷的去处了,,,
00:08:04.310,00:08:04.970,是吧,00:08:03.710,00:08:04.710,Right?
00:08:08.400,00:08:10.690,你们姐妹俩说什么体己话呢,00:08:07.800,00:08:10.090,What are you two sisters talking about?
00:08:10.990,00:08:11.690,这样热闹,00:08:10.390,00:08:11.640,Sounds like a lively discussion.
00:08:12.240,00:08:13.650,皇上万福金安 皇上万安,00:08:11.640,00:08:13.620,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Peace to Your Majesty."
00:08:24.580,00:08:26.620,小姨也来了 这么巧啊,00:08:23.980,00:08:26.284,My sister-in-law is here too. What a coincidence!
00:08:27.040,00:08:27.700,多谢皇上,00:08:26.440,00:08:27.515,I thank Your Majesty.
00:08:31.840,00:08:34.330,这两日 天气热起来了,00:08:31.240,00:08:34.032, The weather is getting hotter lately.
00:08:35.090,00:08:36.300,宫里还住得惯吗,00:08:34.490,00:08:36.341,Are you accustomed to living in the palace?
00:08:37.100,00:08:39.590,有什么不自在的就告诉你姐姐,00:08:36.500,00:08:38.990,"If there's any discomfort, just tell your sister."
00:08:39.970,00:08:41.210,就当是自己家一样,00:08:39.370,00:08:41.176,Consider the palace as your home.
00:08:42.060,00:08:43.670,妹妹入宫也不是一两日了,00:08:41.460,00:08:43.560,Yurao has stayed in the palace for quite some time now.
00:08:44.350,00:08:45.810,虽然宫中与家中不同,00:08:43.750,00:08:46.879,"Although living in the palace is different from at home,
she's gotten used to it."
00:08:46.100,00:08:46.970,但也还是惯的,,,
00:08:47.860,00:08:50.140,外头进了些上好的雨后龙井,00:08:47.260,00:08:50.302,"There was some good first-flush Dragon Well tea
offered as a tribute."
00:08:51.990,00:08:53.020,待会儿给你拿来,00:08:51.390,00:08:52.609,I'll send some to you.
00:08:53.360,00:08:54.690,不知道你妹妹爱不爱喝,00:08:52.760,00:08:54.241,I wonder if your sister likes it.
00:08:55.070,00:08:56.190,多谢皇上关怀,00:08:54.470,00:08:55.930,I thank Your Majesty for caring.
00:08:56.530,00:08:57.860,这宫里繁华巍山我,00:08:55.930,00:08:57.713,"Everything in the palace is grand and majestic,"
00:08:58.490,00:08:59.200,美人又多,00:08:57.890,00:08:59.320,with beautiful ladies in abundance.
00:08:59.580,00:09:00.410,自然是极好的,,,
00:09:00.910,00:09:03.070,只可惜处处得守着规矩,00:08:59.320,00:09:02.504,"Everything is extraordinary,
except that I always have to obey the rules."
00:09:03.410,00:09:05.700,不比在家里让玉娆胡闹惯了,00:09:02.810,00:09:05.440,"Unlike at home, where I have no rules."
00:09:06.370,00:09:08.290,比方说在寻常人家里,00:09:05.770,00:09:09.920,"For example, in ordinary families,
I would call you my brother-in-law."
00:09:08.540,00:09:10.120,玉娆该叫您一声姐夫,,,
00:09:10.710,00:09:11.700,可在这皇宫里,00:09:10.110,00:09:13.429,"However, in the palace, I must always remember that"
00:09:12.090,00:09:13.830,玉娆时时刻刻记在心里的,,,
00:09:14.170,00:09:16.040,是您是君威不可冒犯的皇上,00:09:13.429,00:09:15.863,Your Majesty has heavenly authority and I musn't give offense.
00:09:16.630,00:09:18.340,所以玉娆时刻谨慎,00:09:16.030,00:09:18.200,"I have to be prudent and cautious all the time,"
00:09:18.800,00:09:20.290,不敢把皇宫当家里,00:09:18.200,00:09:20.000,"so, the palace doesn't feel like home."
00:09:21.060,00:09:21.840,你听听,00:09:20.460,00:09:21.504,Listen to that!
00:09:24.770,00:09:27.050,你的口齿也算是伶俐的,00:09:24.170,00:09:26.639,You have great rhetorical skills.
00:09:27.440,00:09:28.600,可是跟你妹妹比起来,00:09:26.840,00:09:30.080,"But compared to your sister, I'm afraid you have to admit defeat."
00:09:28.940,00:09:30.220,恐怕是要甘拜下风了,,,
00:09:31.480,00:09:34.570,明明是说宫里不如在家里自在,00:09:31.380,00:09:34.550,"Here she is: complaining that the palace
 is not as comfortable as home,"
00:09:35.150,00:09:37.610,可偏偏朕就生不起气来,00:09:34.550,00:09:37.350,"but, I just can't get upset with her."
00:09:38.570,00:09:40.530,臣妾最怕的也是玉娆这张嘴,00:09:37.970,00:09:40.194,I'm no match for Yurao's rhetorical skills.
00:09:41.580,00:09:42.570,臣妾老在想,,,
00:09:43.160,00:09:44.490,以后要怎样一位妹夫,00:09:40.980,00:09:46.543,"I've been wondering what kind of future brother-in-law
 will be able to tame her sharp tongue."
00:09:44.830,00:09:46.370,才能管得住玉娆这张利嘴,,,
00:09:47.920,00:09:50.000,你妹妹大老远地才回来,00:09:47.320,00:09:49.702,Your sister just recently returned.
00:09:50.590,00:09:51.670,你这个做姐姐的,00:09:49.990,00:09:53.334,Why are you in such a hurry to marry her off?
00:09:52.050,00:09:53.910,就这么着急地要把她嫁出去吗,,,
00:09:55.260,00:09:56.210,依朕的意思,,,
00:09:56.970,00:10:00.500,小姨年纪还小 可再留两年,00:09:54.660,00:10:00.000,"I suggest she stay around for a couple more years
since she's still young."
00:10:01.050,00:10:03.220,等慢慢地选个好的再说,00:10:00.450,00:10:02.620,She should take her time to select the best for her.
00:10:04.770,00:10:06.720,小姨不是嫌宫里拘束吗,00:10:04.170,00:10:06.497,"If my sister-in-law finds the palace too constraining,"
00:10:07.810,00:10:08.890,朕想起来了,00:10:07.210,00:10:10.743,"I just remembered Yunxi came to the palace today, and"
00:10:09.520,00:10:11.230,允禧今日进宫来了,,,
00:10:12.270,00:10:14.310,跟朕说 天气好,00:10:11.670,00:10:15.397,"he suggested going to the Summer Palace for archery
since the weather is good."
00:10:14.650,00:10:15.890,要去圆明园比箭,,,
00:10:16.780,00:10:19.770,熹贵妃可有兴致陪朕去观赛吗,00:10:16.180,00:10:19.472,"Noble Consort Lumière, will you keep me company?"
00:10:20.950,00:10:21.980,小姨也同去,00:10:20.350,00:10:22.020,And my sister-in-law will join us too.
00:10:22.620,00:10:24.450,凭他是谁 若是箭术不好,00:10:22.020,00:10:25.404,"No matter who he is,
I'm not interested if he's not a good archer."
00:10:24.740,00:10:25.570,臣女才不要看呢,,,
00:10:27.370,00:10:28.410,妹妹这是答应了,00:10:26.770,00:10:28.112,Yurao agrees to go.
00:10:29.040,00:10:30.160,皇上的主意甚好,00:10:28.440,00:10:29.940,Your Majesty's idea is wonderful.
00:10:30.540,00:10:31.780,慎贝勒也是难得进宫,00:10:29.940,00:10:32.300,It's a rare opportunity to see Venerable Prince Shen.
00:10:32.500,00:10:34.740,那就容臣妾和玉娆去更衣,00:10:32.300,00:10:35.840,Please allow us to get changed before joining Your Majesty's procession.
00:10:35.170,00:10:36.040,以便陪伴圣驾,,,
00:10:37.380,00:10:37.870,好,00:10:36.780,00:10:37.620,Good.
00:11:41.320,00:11:41.940,来,00:11:40.720,00:11:41.566,Here.
00:12:15.480,00:12:16.090,好,00:12:14.880,00:12:15.840,Bravo!
00:12:39.170,00:12:41.410,允禧是越发长进了,00:12:38.570,00:12:42.120,Yunxi is getting better and better with his horseback archery.
00:12:41.840,00:12:42.750,骑射俱佳,,,
00:12:43.630,00:12:44.840,老十七的骑射,,,
00:12:45.840,00:12:48.210,原本都是皇阿玛手把手教的,00:12:43.030,00:12:47.600,"Our father taught Yunli horseback archery personally,"
00:12:48.550,00:12:49.590,如今浑都忘了,00:12:47.950,00:12:50.000,but now he is so out of practice that
00:12:52.060,00:12:54.390,还不及七八岁时候的本事了,00:12:51.460,00:12:53.790,he is worse than when he was seven or eight.
00:12:55.900,00:12:56.600,皇兄,00:12:55.300,00:12:56.480,"Your Majesty,"
00:12:57.310,00:12:59.020,我这是把酒问月多了,00:12:56.710,00:13:00.200,"I got rusty from ""drinking alone with the moon"" too much."
00:13:00.150,00:13:00.810,生疏了,,,
00:13:01.780,00:13:02.730,倒是皇兄您,,,
00:13:03.570,00:13:05.810,一直勤力 精于骑射,00:13:01.180,00:13:05.512,Whereas Your Majesty has assiduously maintained your skills in archery.
00:13:08.280,00:13:09.570,老十七还没有成亲,,,
00:13:10.410,00:13:11.150,若是成亲,00:13:07.680,00:13:12.831,"Our 17th brother is still not married.
When he is, his hands and feet will be even softer."
00:13:11.660,00:13:13.280,那手脚不得更发软了吗,,,
00:13:16.370,00:13:18.830,早知道这样 这酒就不喝了,00:13:15.770,00:13:18.720,I wouldn't have drunk if I knew you were going to make fun of me.
00:13:19.590,00:13:22.000,这箭还没射就醉了,00:13:18.990,00:13:21.890,I was already light-headed before shooting the arrow.
00:13:23.920,00:13:24.500,倒上,00:13:23.320,00:13:24.126,Fill up.
00:13:28.970,00:13:29.630,奴婢该死,00:13:28.106,00:13:29.330,My offense deserves death.
00:13:29.930,00:13:31.920,没事一件衣服而已,00:13:29.330,00:13:31.584,"Don't worry, it's just a piece of clothing."
00:13:32.720,00:13:34.130,我去偏殿换一件就是了,00:13:32.120,00:13:33.945,I'll get changed in the side chamber.
00:13:38.190,00:13:38.850,什么东西,00:13:37.590,00:13:38.720,What's that?
00:13:42.650,00:13:43.390,给朕,00:13:42.050,00:13:43.092,Give it to me.
00:14:01.750,00:14:05.420,老十七定是在哪里留情了,00:14:01.150,00:14:04.820,Our 17th brother must have had a romance somewhere.
00:14:06.590,00:14:08.630,要不然身上怎么会有这种,00:14:05.990,00:14:09.640,Otherwise he wouldn't carry a girl's trinket around!
00:14:09.140,00:14:10.250,女儿家的玩意儿,,,
00:14:30.490,00:14:31.400,这剪纸小像,00:14:29.890,00:14:31.360,This paper-cut portrait ...
00:14:32.700,00:14:34.910,倒好像是熹贵妃呢,00:14:32.100,00:14:34.310,looks like Noble Consort Lumière.
00:14:52.680,00:14:53.880,还真是很像,00:14:52.080,00:14:53.733,That's quite a resemblance.
00:14:55.430,00:14:56.670,莫须有的事情,00:14:54.830,00:14:56.630,Unfounded allegations -
00:14:57.230,00:14:59.310,这一年来臣妾已经经历太多,00:14:56.630,00:14:58.710,I have experienced too many this year.
00:15:00.350,00:15:01.470,一张小像而已,00:14:59.750,00:15:01.360,It is just a small portrait.
00:15:02.190,00:15:03.770,怎么认定就是臣妾呢,00:15:01.590,00:15:03.698,What makes Your Majesty think it is me?
00:15:05.900,00:15:07.770,这张小像的确有些像熹贵妃,00:15:05.300,00:15:07.472,This small image does look a bit like Noble Consort Lumière.
00:15:08.360,00:15:09.230,但皇上不觉得,00:15:07.760,00:15:09.050,But doesn’t Your Majesty think
00:15:09.650,00:15:11.140,也挺像二小姐和浣碧的吗,00:15:09.050,00:15:10.993,it also resembles Yurao or Jade?
00:15:14.580,00:15:16.820,小像上的女子眉目宜喜宜喷,00:15:13.980,00:15:16.937,The girl in the portrait looks happy and displeased at the same time.
00:15:17.830,00:15:19.790,臣妾越看越觉得像二小姐,00:15:17.230,00:15:19.520,"The more I look at it, the more I think it resembles Yurao."
00:15:24.670,00:15:26.330,再过一个月便是七夕了,00:15:24.070,00:15:26.749,"In a month it will be the Qixi Festival.
 [Chinese Valentine's Day]"
00:15:27.550,00:15:29.830,皇上是否也该成全一段佳话,00:15:26.950,00:15:29.230,Will Your Majesty give this story a happy ending?
00:15:31.680,00:15:32.380,这,00:15:31.080,00:15:32.200,But…
00:15:32.800,00:15:34.670,二小姐跟十七哥才第一次见哪,00:15:32.200,00:15:34.447,Yurao and Yunli just met for the first time.
00:15:58.160,00:16:02.620,这个小像的边缘略有褪色,00:15:57.560,00:16:02.397,The edges of this image are slightly discolored.
00:16:03.960,00:16:08.040,定是老十七拿在手里看了很多次,00:16:03.360,00:16:07.440,Yunli must have held it in his hand and looked at it many times.
00:16:10.090,00:16:12.210,小姨是数月前才入宫的,00:16:09.490,00:16:12.080,My sister-in-law came to the palace a few months ago.
00:16:12.680,00:16:14.760,之前从来没有见过老十七,00:16:12.080,00:16:14.160,She didn’t met Yunli until today.
00:16:15.090,00:16:15.750,不会是她,00:16:14.490,00:16:15.565,It’s not her.
00:16:26.810,00:16:28.300,请皇上恕奴婢死罪,00:16:26.210,00:16:28.320,I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness for my capital offense.
,,,00:16:28.340,00:16:29.423,This ...
00:16:28.940,00:16:32.400,此物是奴婢的小像,00:16:30.253,00:16:32.253,is my image.
00:16:35.660,00:16:36.320,果真,00:16:35.060,00:16:36.097,Really?
00:16:38.700,00:16:39.740,这是七年前,00:16:38.100,00:16:40.000,"It was seven years ago,"
00:16:40.700,00:16:42.790,奴婢亲手放入这个矜缨中的,00:16:40.100,00:16:42.416,I put it in this tasseled sachet.
00:16:44.290,00:16:47.250,当时娘娘被华妃罚跪在栩坤宫前,00:16:43.690,00:16:47.367,"When Consort Fleur ordered Her Highness to be
punished by kneeling in the Palace of Earthly Honor,"
00:16:47.630,00:16:50.490,奴婢遇见十七爷便请他援手相助,00:16:47.367,00:16:50.343,"I met Lord XVII, so I asked him for help."
00:16:51.300,00:16:54.210,过后 奴婢到了凝晖堂致谢,00:16:50.700,00:16:53.987,"After that, I went to the Hall of Converging Light to extend my gratitude."
00:16:56.550,00:16:57.260,是吗,00:16:55.950,00:16:57.113,You did?
00:16:58.180,00:17:00.840,当时 奴婢到凝晖堂致谢的时候,00:16:57.580,00:17:00.693,"When I was in the Hall of Converging Light,"
00:17:02.140,00:17:04.510,看到王爷的桌上有几张彩纸,00:17:01.540,00:17:04.480,I saw some pieces of colored paper on the table.
00:17:05.190,00:17:07.520,一时兴起便剪了几朵窗花,00:17:04.590,00:17:07.222,"On a whim, I cut some window flowers"
00:17:07.980,00:17:09.310,送给王爷做谢礼,00:17:07.380,00:17:09.125,as a thank-you gift for His Lordship.
00:17:10.150,00:17:14.060,那时候 王爷问奴婢是否会剪小像,00:17:09.550,00:17:13.460,"Then, His Lordship asked me if I knew how to cut a portrait."
00:17:15.070,00:17:16.650,奴婢就按照自己的模样,00:17:14.470,00:17:16.310,So I cut out an image in my own likeness
00:17:16.910,00:17:18.570,剪了一个小像放入矜缨中,00:17:16.310,00:17:18.574,and put it into this sachet.
00:17:21.160,00:17:24.780,后来有一次 王爷和奴婢相见,00:17:20.560,00:17:24.293,"On another day, His Lordship met me."
00:17:25.370,00:17:27.080,王爷问奴婢喜欢什么花,00:17:24.770,00:17:26.940,"He asked me my favorite flower, and"
00:17:27.540,00:17:28.830,奴婢说喜欢杜若,00:17:26.940,00:17:28.683,I told him I like pollia.
00:17:31.340,00:17:33.500,皇上可以看看矜缨中,00:17:30.740,00:17:33.202,Your Majesty can see if there are
00:17:34.170,00:17:35.880,是否有几片杜若的花瓣,00:17:33.570,00:17:35.544,a few petals of pollia in the sachet.
00:17:46.230,00:17:47.060,果然不错,00:17:45.630,00:17:46.913,Exactly so.
00:17:47.900,00:17:49.140,如果不是你的小像,00:17:47.300,00:17:48.840,"If it wasn't your image,"
00:17:49.440,00:17:49.890,你怎么会知道,,,
00:17:50.270,00:17:51.760,这里头装了些什么东西呢,00:17:48.840,00:17:51.520,how would you know what is inside?
00:17:54.740,00:17:57.770,嬛嬛 她的心思你可知道吗,00:17:54.140,00:17:57.434,"Huan Huan, have you known her heart?"
00:17:59.910,00:18:01.110,臣妾竟是个傻子,00:17:59.310,00:18:00.960,I am such a fool.
00:18:01.660,00:18:04.120,这丫头瞒得臣妾好苦,00:18:01.060,00:18:03.840,She put herself through a lot hiding it from me.
00:18:05.660,00:18:08.500,我记得你日日插一朵杜鹃在发上,00:18:05.060,00:18:08.089,I've noticed that you wear an azalea in your hair every day.
00:18:09.380,00:18:11.960,怎么 你喜欢的花竟不是杜鹃,00:18:08.780,00:18:11.586,"Why? Do you prefer azalea,"
00:18:12.380,00:18:13.210,而是杜若吗,00:18:11.780,00:18:12.610,rather than pollia?
00:18:14.420,00:18:16.630,那是因为王爷说,00:18:13.820,00:18:16.370,That is because His Lordship said that
00:18:16.970,00:18:18.460,奴婢戴杜鹃花好看,00:18:16.370,00:18:18.200,I look pleasing with azalea blooms in my hair.
,,,00:18:18.370,00:18:19.360,So…
00:18:18.970,00:18:21.130,所以 所以,00:18:20.000,00:18:20.800,So I ...
00:18:22.310,00:18:24.800,前几月 臣妾去熹贵妃宫中,00:18:21.710,00:18:24.500,"A few months ago, whenever I visited Consort Lumière’s palace,"
00:18:25.100,00:18:25.960,总不见浣碧,00:18:24.500,00:18:25.960,I didn’t see Jade.
00:18:26.560,00:18:27.770,听说十七爷病了,00:18:25.960,00:18:27.840,"I heard that when Lord XVII was sick,"
00:18:28.440,00:18:29.680,是浣碧去照料的,00:18:27.840,00:18:29.440,it was Jade who took care of him.
00:18:30.900,00:18:32.640,臣妾当时还疑惑,00:18:30.300,00:18:32.417,I was confused at the time.
00:18:33.650,00:18:35.690,原来是有这段缘分在呀,00:18:33.050,00:18:35.505,It turns out there is this fated relationship!
00:18:36.690,00:18:37.650,难怪呀,00:18:36.090,00:18:38.040,No wonder.
00:18:38.610,00:18:39.690,难怪当日,,,
00:18:40.780,00:18:42.520,朕跟熹贵妃开玩笑说,00:18:38.080,00:18:42.200,"That's why you dropped the tray in fright that day,"
00:18:42.830,00:18:44.070,要选你做常在,00:18:42.230,00:18:45.760,"when I teased Noble Consort Lumière
that I would promote you to Attendant."
00:18:44.370,00:18:46.030,吓得连手里的东西都砸了,,,
00:18:47.500,00:18:48.280,也难怪,00:18:46.900,00:18:48.246,"And that's also why,"
00:18:49.330,00:18:51.370,老十七连个侧福晋都不纳,00:18:48.730,00:18:51.487,Yunli never even considered having a Lord Consort.
00:18:52.750,00:18:55.290,奴婢微贱之身 不敢高攀王爷,00:18:52.150,00:18:55.180,"Given my humble status, I dare not ""climb on a high branch."""
00:18:56.260,00:18:56.910,只是,00:18:55.660,00:18:56.649,Yet...
00:18:58.220,00:19:00.420,奴婢听说王爷的别院中,00:18:57.620,00:19:01.600,"I've heard that his Lordship's garden has
planted plums with jade-colored blossoms."
00:19:00.800,00:19:02.210,种了许多碧色的梅花,,,
00:19:03.100,00:19:04.630,奴婢一直无缘相见,00:19:02.500,00:19:04.540,I haven't had the honor to see them.
00:19:05.390,00:19:08.100,只是希望如果有一天能够看看,00:19:04.790,00:19:07.500,"I only wish that I'll be able to look at them some day,"
00:19:08.850,00:19:09.970,那也就心满意足了,00:19:07.760,00:19:10.000,then I shall be happy and content.
00:19:11.650,00:19:13.140,你们如果再等下去,00:19:11.050,00:19:13.068,"If you two keep on waiting,"
00:19:14.190,00:19:16.430,恐怕要再等七年,00:19:13.590,00:19:16.283,I'm afraid you'll be waiting for another seven years!
00:19:17.490,00:19:20.350,来来来 今日由朕做主,00:19:16.890,00:19:19.750,"Here, today I'll make a ruling:"
00:19:21.320,00:19:23.690,就把浣碧赐给你了,00:19:20.720,00:19:23.354,Jade is granted marriage with you.
00:19:24.120,00:19:24.650,皇兄,00:19:23.520,00:19:24.270,Your Majesty -
00:19:24.870,00:19:26.860,只是奴婢身份低微,00:19:24.270,00:19:26.562,"Your Majesty, with my lowly status,"
00:19:27.830,00:19:29.410,怎么有幸伺候王爷呢,00:19:27.230,00:19:29.451,how do I deserve the honor to serve His Lordship?
00:19:30.250,00:19:32.360,如果不是老十七亲口对你说,00:19:29.650,00:19:31.649,"If Yunli didn't tell you,"
00:19:33.250,00:19:34.990,你怎么会知道他的别院里,00:19:32.781,00:19:36.287,how could you know about those jade-colored plum blossoms?
00:19:35.340,00:19:36.830,种了些碧色的梅花呢,,,
00:19:40.170,00:19:41.130,你又叫浣碧,00:19:39.570,00:19:40.960,"Also, your name is ""Jade""!"
00:19:42.640,00:19:45.250,老十七的府里缺个打理家事的人,00:19:42.040,00:19:45.120,Yunli needs someone to take care of his estate affairs.
00:19:46.350,00:19:49.710,你一直在熹贵妃的身边小心谨慎,00:19:45.750,00:19:49.412,"For years, you have served Noble Consort Lumière attentively."
00:19:50.980,00:19:51.640,你,00:19:50.380,00:19:51.682,You -
00:19:54.730,00:19:55.640,朕很放心,00:19:54.248,00:19:55.531,have my trust.
00:19:58.280,00:19:59.940,若这样把浣碧赐予王爷,00:19:57.680,00:19:59.717,"Your Majesty, it does seem improper"
00:20:00.780,00:20:02.020,臣妾也觉得不妥,00:20:00.180,00:20:01.722,if Jade is granted to His Lordship like this.
00:20:02.660,00:20:03.640,那她进了王府,00:20:02.060,00:20:03.890,"When she enter's His Lordship's estate,"
00:20:04.120,00:20:05.320,身份是侍妾,00:20:03.890,00:20:07.040,"will she be a concubine, consort, or the primary wife?"
00:20:05.780,00:20:07.190,侧福晋还是福晋呢,,,
00:20:08.120,00:20:10.950,浣碧作为贵妃的陪嫁去服侍王爷,00:20:07.520,00:20:09.764,It's already an excessive honor
00:20:11.330,00:20:12.820,做个侍妾也算抬举了,00:20:09.764,00:20:12.692,for a dowry maid of Her Noble Highness to serve His Lordship.
00:20:18.750,00:20:21.000,臣妾当年离宫修行,00:20:18.150,00:20:20.990,"Your Majesty, after I left the palace and went to the temple,"
00:20:21.590,00:20:23.920,身边只有槿汐与浣碧风霜与共,00:20:20.990,00:20:23.924,"I had only Jade and Jinxi to share the ""frosts and storms."""
00:20:25.140,00:20:27.750,浣碧与臣妾一同长大 犹如姐妹,00:20:24.540,00:20:27.716,"Jade grew up with me, and we're as close as sisters."
00:20:28.720,00:20:31.640,臣妾想 王爷钟情浣碧七年,00:20:28.120,00:20:31.680,"Your Majesty, since His Lordship has cherished Jade for seven years,"
00:20:32.480,00:20:34.590,想来也是不愿薄待她,00:20:31.880,00:20:35.235,"I believe, it's because he didn't want her to be treated poorly."
00:20:36.190,00:20:37.390,那你想如何,00:20:35.590,00:20:37.130,What do you propose?
00:20:40.230,00:20:41.770,臣妾想收浣碧为义妹,00:20:39.630,00:20:41.963,I request to take Jade as my honorary sister
00:20:42.400,00:20:43.230,名入族谱,00:20:41.963,00:20:43.489,and record her name in the pedigree book
00:20:43.900,00:20:45.690,以钮祜禄家二小姐的身份,00:20:43.489,00:20:45.640,"as the second daughter of the Niohuru family,"
00:20:46.240,00:20:48.530,风风光光嫁入果郡王府为福晋,00:20:45.640,00:20:48.940,so she can gloriously marry into His Lordship's estate as the primary wife.
00:20:49.540,00:20:51.530,贵妃心疼浣碧也要适可而止,00:20:48.940,00:20:51.534,Your Noble Highness must know your care for Jade has its limits.
00:20:52.330,00:20:53.790,将来命妇入宫朝见,00:20:51.730,00:20:54.065,"When all the lords' wives come to the palace in the future,"
00:20:54.420,00:20:55.750,难不成浣碧作为福晋,00:20:54.065,00:20:57.360,should Jade be on equal footing with us imperial concubines?
00:20:56.130,00:20:57.240,要与咱们平起平坐吗,,,
00:20:57.960,00:20:59.700,奴婢知道小主顾及奴婢,00:20:57.360,00:20:59.666,"My Lady, I understand you care for me deeply,"
00:21:00.460,00:21:03.080,只是奴婢根本都不在乎名分,00:20:59.860,00:21:02.480,but the title doesn't matter to me.
00:21:04.130,00:21:06.120,还请小主不要为奴婢操心了,00:21:03.530,00:21:05.671,Please don't worry over me.
00:21:06.720,00:21:07.330,浣碧,00:21:06.120,00:21:07.070,"Jade,"
00:21:08.100,00:21:09.430,你不知道人多口杂,00:21:07.500,00:21:09.471,you know not the whispers of the crowd.
00:21:10.350,00:21:12.130,你若这样无名无分进了王府,00:21:09.750,00:21:12.210,"If you enter His Lordship's estate without a good title and name,"
00:21:12.810,00:21:14.010,来日别人议论起来,00:21:12.210,00:21:14.080,"when people talk about this,"
00:21:14.940,00:21:17.890,说得好呢 是你与王爷钟情多年,00:21:14.340,00:21:17.590,some may kindly say you've been cherished by His Lordship for years;
00:21:18.190,00:21:19.050,成就良缘,00:21:17.590,00:21:19.243,that your fate was granted.
00:21:19.480,00:21:20.190,说得不好,,,
00:21:20.610,00:21:22.100,连私通这种话都会说出来,00:21:19.243,00:21:21.975,But others may maliciously speak of pre-marital intercourse.
00:21:22.820,00:21:24.600,白白连累你与王爷的名声,00:21:22.220,00:21:24.640,It will ruin both of your reputations for nothing.
00:21:28.200,00:21:28.980,皇兄,00:21:27.600,00:21:28.644,"Your Majesty,"
00:21:29.830,00:21:32.780,恕臣弟不能纳浣碧姑娘为福晋,00:21:29.230,00:21:32.180,"please excuse my obstinence, but I cannot take Jade as my primary wife."
00:21:34.330,00:21:35.740,臣弟在很多年前,00:21:33.730,00:21:35.140,"Many years ago,"
00:21:36.170,00:21:37.450,曾经遇到过一个女子,00:21:35.570,00:21:36.850,I met a lady ...
00:21:37.960,00:21:38.910,和她两情相悦,00:21:37.360,00:21:38.725,our hearts were committed.
00:21:39.750,00:21:41.160,后来虽然分隔千里,00:21:39.150,00:21:40.900,"Later on, we were parted with a thousand miles between us,"
00:21:41.500,00:21:42.290,不能结为夫妇,00:21:40.900,00:21:42.400,and we weren't able to marry.
00:21:42.920,00:21:43.880,但在臣弟心里,00:21:42.400,00:21:43.582,"Yet in my heart,"
00:21:44.970,00:21:46.170,她才是唯一的妻子,00:21:44.521,00:21:46.240,she is my only wife.
00:21:48.090,00:21:49.080,浣碧姑娘虽好,00:21:47.490,00:21:48.857,"Jade is a good girl,"
00:21:50.100,00:21:52.340,但臣弟绝对不会以她为福晋的,00:21:49.500,00:21:51.740,but I can never take her as my primary wife.
00:21:54.850,00:21:57.260,还望熹贵妃体谅,00:21:54.250,00:21:56.924,I hope Noble Consort Lumière can understand.
00:21:59.400,00:22:00.390,皇上做主吧,00:21:58.800,00:22:00.469,I leave the decision to Your Majesty.
00:22:01.360,00:22:02.850,只别委屈了浣碧就好,00:22:00.760,00:22:02.250,I only ask that Jade is not mistreated.
00:22:03.190,00:22:04.980,朕如你所求,00:22:02.590,00:22:04.606,I permit your request.
00:22:06.740,00:22:10.100,让浣碧以钮佑禄家二小姐的身份,00:22:06.140,00:22:09.695,Jade will become the second daughter of Niohoru
00:22:10.570,00:22:12.570,嫁给果郡王为侧福晋,00:22:10.223,00:22:12.971,and marry Noble Prince Guo as his Lord Consort.
00:22:16.210,00:22:17.290,奴婢叩谢皇上,00:22:15.610,00:22:16.954,I thank your Majesty.
00:22:17.710,00:22:19.120,恭喜果郡王 恭喜浣碧姑娘,00:22:17.110,00:22:19.652,"- Congratulations, Lord XVII. Congratulations, Jade.
- You may rise!"

00:22:19.290,00:22:20.530,起来吧,,,
00:22:33.930,00:22:35.010,臣妾敬皇上,00:22:33.330,00:22:35.144,Here's to Your Majesty.
00:23:02.330,00:23:03.070,小主醉了,00:23:01.730,00:23:03.110,"My Lady, you are tipsy."
00:23:03.710,00:23:06.170,奴婢扶小主去吹风醒醒酒,00:23:03.110,00:23:05.608,Let me take you for a walk to sober up.
00:23:23.560,00:23:24.970,浣碧 我来,00:23:22.960,00:23:24.370,"Jade, allow me."
00:23:29.610,00:23:30.270,小心,00:23:29.010,00:23:30.000,Careful.
00:23:32.620,00:23:33.230,小心,00:23:32.020,00:23:32.970,Careful.
00:24:01.020,00:24:01.930,这双手,00:24:00.420,00:24:01.670,"These hands,"
00:24:03.900,00:24:04.760,这个人,00:24:03.300,00:24:04.537,"this person,"
00:24:07.570,00:24:09.680,从此都归浣碧所有了,00:24:06.970,00:24:09.080,all belong to Jade from now on.
00:24:17.280,00:24:18.190,我知道你难受,00:24:16.680,00:24:18.005,"I know your heart is heavy,"
00:24:22.160,00:24:23.450,但我比你更难受,00:24:21.560,00:24:23.340,but I feel even worse than you do!
00:24:31.220,00:24:32.830,今日你与本宫同喜,00:24:30.620,00:24:33.173,Today we celebrate this joyous occasion.
00:24:36.260,00:24:38.050,明日你便是本宫的妹夫了,00:24:35.660,00:24:37.865,Tomorrow you will be my brother-in-law.
00:24:42.480,00:24:43.340,一定要这样吗,00:24:41.880,00:24:43.570,Does it have to be like this?
00:24:46.520,00:24:47.230,你瞧,00:24:45.920,00:24:47.158,"You see,"
00:24:50.190,00:24:51.980,月亮注定是要西沉的,00:24:49.590,00:24:51.946,the moon is destined to sink in the west.
,,,00:24:55.060,00:24:56.854,There's no other path
00:24:55.660,00:24:59.320,我和你也没有别的路可以走,00:24:57.118,00:24:58.984,for you and I to follow.
00:25:02.370,00:25:03.410,若不如此,00:25:01.770,00:25:03.452,"If we do not obey,"
00:25:04.670,00:25:06.000,死的不只你我,00:25:04.070,00:25:06.230,there will be more than our own deaths to pay.
00:25:08.090,00:25:09.000,仅仅流言,00:25:07.490,00:25:09.079,The rumors alone....
00:25:11.050,00:25:12.830,温实初便是前车之鉴,00:25:10.450,00:25:12.960,Wen Shichu is the example before us.
00:25:14.550,00:25:15.880,我不能再连累你,00:25:13.950,00:25:15.959,I can't let you be dragged down.
00:25:17.180,00:25:17.960,那天的事,00:25:16.580,00:25:18.001,I hated myself
00:25:19.600,00:25:22.590,我为不能来帮你而恨自己,00:25:19.000,00:25:22.080,for not being able to come to your aid that day.
00:25:23.730,00:25:25.590,若那日被指认的人是你,00:25:23.130,00:25:24.990,"If you were the one that had been accused,"
00:25:26.520,00:25:27.730,我只怕会发疯,00:25:25.920,00:25:28.035,I'm afraid I would have gone mad.
00:25:35.070,00:25:36.440,浣碧一直喜欢你,00:25:34.319,00:25:36.557,Jade has always been fond of you.
00:25:39.910,00:25:41.190,她对你的情意,00:25:39.310,00:25:41.355,Her affection for you
00:25:43.120,00:25:44.700,并不比我对你少,00:25:42.638,00:25:44.382,is no less than mine.
00:25:46.500,00:25:47.490,我很早就知道,00:25:45.900,00:25:47.456,I knew that a long time ago.
00:25:51.130,00:25:52.080,你不要辜负她,00:25:50.530,00:25:51.933,Don't fail her.
00:25:58.180,00:25:59.010,你知道的,00:25:57.580,00:25:58.976,You know me.
00:26:01.560,00:26:04.340,我只要你,00:26:00.960,00:26:04.004,I only want you.
00:26:07.440,00:26:08.770,此生以今日为界,00:26:06.840,00:26:08.962,Today is the border of our lives.
00:26:10.770,00:26:11.760,从前只有我,00:26:10.170,00:26:11.839,"Before, all you had was me."
00:26:13.190,00:26:14.520,往后便只有浣碧了,00:26:12.590,00:26:14.720,"From now on and after, there's only Jade."
00:26:18.820,00:26:19.810,告诉你实话,00:26:18.220,00:26:19.680,"To tell you the truth,"
00:26:21.830,00:26:23.070,浣碧并非我义妹,00:26:21.230,00:26:22.772,"Jade is not just ""my honorary sister,"""
00:26:24.620,00:26:25.610,而是我亲妹妹,00:26:24.020,00:26:25.789,she is my sister by blood.
00:26:27.460,00:26:29.490,她母亲曾是我父亲心爱之人,00:26:26.860,00:26:29.343,My father loved her mother dearly.
00:26:30.420,00:26:31.580,只因是罪臣之女,00:26:29.820,00:26:32.302,"But since her mother was the daughter of a guilty official,"
00:26:33.960,00:26:35.790,所以父亲不得不隐瞒此事,00:26:33.360,00:26:35.454,father had to hide the truth.
00:26:37.220,00:26:38.920,无法让浣碧认祖归宗,00:26:36.620,00:26:39.040,Jade could not be acknowledged by our ancestors.
00:26:44.470,00:26:45.710,你一定要好好待她,00:26:43.870,00:26:45.752,You must treat her well.
00:27:10.040,00:27:11.000,太后病重,00:27:09.440,00:27:11.192,The Empress Dowager is gravely ill.
00:27:11.960,00:27:13.790,有你的婚事冲一冲也好,00:27:11.360,00:27:14.699,It's good to have a wedding to drive away any misfortune.
00:27:15.630,00:27:18.340,这桩姻缘虽然门第有些不般配,00:27:15.030,00:27:18.370,"Even though family status is mismatched in this marriage,"
00:27:18.970,00:27:21.000,但总还是情投意合的,00:27:18.370,00:27:20.815,you two have genuine feelings for each other.
00:27:21.840,00:27:23.000,一切听从皇兄安排,00:27:21.240,00:27:23.000,I follow Your Majesty's arrangement.
00:27:23.600,00:27:25.010,说到这个门第,00:27:23.000,00:27:25.342,Speaking of family status ...
00:27:26.560,00:27:28.220,朕倒想起一桩事情,00:27:25.960,00:27:28.320,reminds me of something.
00:27:29.310,00:27:30.140,数年前,00:27:28.710,00:27:30.000,"Several years ago,"
00:27:30.890,00:27:32.630,太后曾想为你指婚,00:27:30.290,00:27:33.451,the Empress Dowager wanted to arrange a marriage for you.
00:27:34.270,00:27:37.390,十分中意沛国公府的小姐孟静娴,00:27:33.670,00:27:37.545,"She's very fond of Meng Jingxian, the daughter of Duke of Pei."
00:27:38.400,00:27:41.140,且孟静娴幼时曾与你一见,00:27:37.800,00:27:40.869,"She met you once when you were young,"
00:27:41.780,00:27:42.740,钟情许久,00:27:40.869,00:27:42.970,and she's been devoted for a long time.
00:27:43.570,00:27:45.490,然而你始终未允,00:27:42.970,00:27:45.380,But you never agreed to the marriage.
00:27:46.580,00:27:49.790,那孟静娴却痴心一片 再不肯嫁,00:27:45.980,00:27:49.454,Meng Jingxian is so committed she refuses to marry anyone else.
00:27:50.540,00:27:54.200,一来二去竟耽误成了未嫁之女,00:27:49.940,00:27:53.600,Biding her time has left her as his only unmarried daughter.
00:27:55.090,00:27:57.170,如今你要纳侧福晋的事情,00:27:54.490,00:27:57.920,"When the news of you having a Lord Consort spread,"
00:27:57.420,00:27:58.160,一传出去,00:27:58.110,00:28:00.333,grief overcame her ...
00:27:58.710,00:28:02.550,孟静娴触动情肠 伤心欲绝,00:28:00.823,00:28:02.372,and she's become
00:28:03.590,00:28:05.460,竟抱病不起,00:28:02.995,00:28:05.111,too ill to get out of bed.
00:28:06.470,00:28:08.430,沛国公爱女心切,00:28:05.870,00:28:08.420,The Duke of Pei earnestly loves his daughter
00:28:09.020,00:28:11.300,连上了三道请安摺子与朕,00:28:08.420,00:28:11.340,"and sent three memorandums to me,"
00:28:11.940,00:28:15.550,恳请朕体念他女儿痴心一片,00:28:11.340,00:28:15.630,begging me to have mercy on his daughter's devotion.
00:28:16.230,00:28:19.470,I情原页女儿居侍妾之位,00:28:15.630,00:28:19.059,He's willing to let her be a concubine
00:28:19.900,00:28:21.640,侍奉在果郡王左右,00:28:19.300,00:28:22.050,to serve by the side of Noble Prince Guo.
00:28:22.650,00:28:24.820,不致使他老来失了爱女,00:28:22.050,00:28:24.770,So he will not lose his daughter at his advanced age.
00:28:25.370,00:28:26.070,皇兄明鉴,00:28:24.770,00:28:26.883,"Imperial Brother, you are wise to see that"
00:28:27.030,00:28:28.620,臣弟实在不原页意多娶,00:28:26.883,00:28:28.666,I really do not want to marry someone else.
00:28:29.040,00:28:30.620,况且臣弟和孟小姐本无意,00:28:28.666,00:28:30.709,And we have no genuine feelings for each other.
00:28:31.120,00:28:32.200,别白白耽搁了她,00:28:30.709,00:28:32.379,It'd cause regrets in her life...
00:28:32.790,00:28:35.580,沛国公两朝元老,00:28:32.379,00:28:36.134,The Duke of Pei has served the reigns of two emperors.
00:28:37.170,00:28:40.750,如此言辞卑微 爱女情切,00:28:36.570,00:28:40.450,"He used such humble words for the love of his daughter,"
00:28:41.050,00:28:42.210,朕也不免动容,00:28:40.450,00:28:42.740,even I can't help being moved by him.
00:28:43.340,00:28:45.800,况且男子有个三妻四妾,00:28:42.740,00:28:45.200,"Besides, it's quite common"
00:28:46.140,00:28:47.380,是最寻常不过的,00:28:45.540,00:28:46.780,for a man to have several concubines.
00:28:47.720,00:28:48.590,朕都想好了,00:28:47.120,00:28:48.800,I have thought it through.
00:28:50.020,00:28:53.800,让孟小姐和浣碧同为你的侧福晋,00:28:49.420,00:28:53.200,I'll let Lady Meng and Jade both be your Lord Consorts.
00:28:54.230,00:28:55.720,可臣弟已经耽误她那么多年了,00:28:53.630,00:28:55.800,"But I have kept her from happiness for so many years,"
00:28:56.400,00:28:57.560,何必拖上她一辈子呢,00:28:55.800,00:28:57.644,why should I drag her down for a lifetime?
00:28:57.980,00:28:58.970,亲贵娶亲,00:28:57.644,00:28:59.464,"In a nobleman's marriage,"
00:28:59.900,00:29:01.640,真心是最不要紧的,00:28:59.464,00:29:02.372,all other matters take precedence over a true heart.
00:29:03.400,00:29:04.890,朕要你娶她,00:29:02.800,00:29:04.600,I want you to marry her
00:29:05.200,00:29:07.230,也是为了安抚老臣之心,00:29:04.600,00:29:08.317,to pacify the heart of a veteran official.
00:29:09.120,00:29:10.700,你若是真不喜欢她,00:29:08.520,00:29:10.100,"If you really don't like her,"
00:29:11.330,00:29:12.660,只当是养在家里吧,00:29:10.730,00:29:12.852,consider it as keeping one more person at home.
00:29:13.750,00:29:16.330,何苦累她病得丢了一条性命,00:29:13.150,00:29:15.881,Why let her illness take her life away?
00:29:17.250,00:29:21.290,若沛国公因此事心中生怨,00:29:16.650,00:29:21.400,"If Duke of Pei develops a grudge because of this,"
00:29:22.340,00:29:25.080,于朝政也不相安啊,00:29:21.740,00:29:24.631,it's not good for the peace in the court.
00:29:25.800,00:29:26.590,如此说来,00:29:25.200,00:29:26.738,"If you say so,"
00:29:27.590,00:29:29.080,臣弟只能养她一世,00:29:26.990,00:29:28.800,I must provide for her for life.
00:29:29.720,00:29:30.800,好好待她就是了,00:29:29.068,00:29:31.080,I will treat her well.
00:29:31.770,00:29:33.510,朕要的就是这句话,00:29:31.170,00:29:33.250,That's what I want to hear.
00:29:33.850,00:29:34.680,那臣弟也有一事,00:29:33.250,00:29:34.880,"Then I also have one request, Your Majesty."
00:29:35.480,00:29:36.060,说,00:29:34.880,00:29:35.460,Speak.
00:29:38.980,00:29:39.850,臣弟请旨,00:29:38.380,00:29:39.665,I request Your Majesty's decree
00:29:41.150,00:29:43.390,臣弟终身不再另娶,00:29:40.550,00:29:43.767,that I will not marry again all my life.
00:29:44.650,00:29:47.240,还要浣碧入府主持家事,00:29:44.050,00:29:46.993,"Also, I want Jade to manage the estate affairs."
00:29:50.870,00:29:53.400,还未成亲呢 就如此偏爱,00:29:50.270,00:29:53.777,You already have your favorite before your wedding.
00:29:55.040,00:29:56.400,孟小姐身子不好,00:29:54.440,00:29:56.320,"Lady Meng is in ill health,"
00:29:57.080,00:29:59.490,浣碧主持家务也是应该的,00:29:56.480,00:29:58.890,so Jade should take charge of household affairs.
00:30:03.010,00:30:04.250,迎娶侧福晋,00:30:02.410,00:30:04.799,There are six protocols in the marriage of a lord consort:
00:30:04.720,00:30:08.130,有纳彩 问名 纳吉,00:30:04.799,00:30:08.130,"Betrothal, requesting the bride's name and horoscope,
ancestral fortune-telling on the horoscope,"
00:30:08.390,00:30:11.050,纳征 请期 迎亲六礼,00:30:08.130,00:30:11.160,"sending gifts, selecting an auspicious date,
and the marriage ceremony."
00:30:11.760,00:30:13.880,其余的都打点妥当了,00:30:11.160,00:30:13.710,"All the other protocols have been arranged,"
00:30:14.310,00:30:15.760,只有这问名一节,00:30:13.710,00:30:15.782,but the bride's name ...
00:30:16.770,00:30:19.130,姓钮祜禄氏 既为义女,00:30:16.170,00:30:18.530,"The family name is Niohuru. As an honarary daughter,"
00:30:19.810,00:30:21.350,我家排行从玉从女,00:30:19.210,00:30:20.750,the daughters of my family
00:30:22.020,00:30:23.140,浣碧算是二小姐,00:30:20.976,00:30:23.180,"are given names starting with the character ""Yu"" or ""Nü""."
00:30:23.780,00:30:25.480,内务府已经准备了几个,00:30:23.180,00:30:25.180,The household department has prepared
00:30:25.780,00:30:26.560,从玉的名字,00:30:25.180,00:30:26.470,"several names with ""Yu""."
00:30:27.070,00:30:29.560,就请浣碧姑娘自己择一个吧,00:30:26.470,00:30:29.337,"If you please, Jade, you can pick one name for yourself."
00:30:31.830,00:30:32.990,浣碧 你自己看看,00:30:31.230,00:30:32.747,"Jade, take a look,"
00:30:33.290,00:30:34.020,喜欢哪一个,00:30:32.747,00:30:34.341,which one do you like?
00:30:36.000,00:30:37.780,都是从玉的好名字,00:30:35.400,00:30:37.444,"All are good names with ""Yu""."
00:30:38.210,00:30:40.490,玉沁 玉隐 玉乔,00:30:37.610,00:30:39.890,"Yuqin, Yuyin, Yuqiao."
00:30:42.000,00:30:43.370,怎么从玉不从女呀,00:30:41.400,00:30:43.373,"Why are there only names with ""Yu"" but not ""Nü""?"
00:30:44.250,00:30:45.920,不像钮佑禄家的亲生女儿,00:30:43.650,00:30:46.030,It doesn't sound like the birth daughters of the Niohuru family.
00:30:46.630,00:30:49.620,礼部说 义女非本家出身,00:30:46.030,00:30:49.553,"The Ministry of Rites said that an honorary daughter
is not originally from the family,"
00:30:49.970,00:30:51.170,总得内外有别,00:30:49.553,00:30:51.080,"and there needs to be a difference,"
00:30:51.680,00:30:54.090,所以只能从玉字排行,00:30:51.080,00:30:53.943,"so the names can only start with ""Yu""."
00:30:55.560,00:30:56.050,太医说,,,
00:30:56.430,00:30:57.840,父亲的病已经好得差不多了,00:30:54.838,00:30:57.809,"The imperial doctor said
father is basically recovered from his illness."
00:30:59.190,00:31:00.930,你娘入宗庙的事情要紧,00:30:58.590,00:31:02.861,The most important thing is that your mother enters the ancestral shrine.
00:31:04.820,00:31:07.770,那就玉隐吧,00:31:04.220,00:31:07.170,"Then, I choose Yuyin [hidden jade]."
00:31:08.860,00:31:10.270,按照娘娘的意思,00:31:08.260,00:31:09.970,"Her Noble Highness told us,"
00:31:10.570,00:31:12.310,陪嫁除了内务府的那份,00:31:09.970,00:31:12.000,"added to the dowry from the Household Department,"
00:31:12.620,00:31:14.070,永寿宫按三倍之数,00:31:12.000,00:31:15.960,"the Palace of Eternal Longevity will give
three times that dowry for Yuyin's wedding."
00:31:14.410,00:31:16.370,再为玉隐姑娘添置嫁妆,,,
00:31:16.750,00:31:18.660,由敬妃娘娘主婚,00:31:16.150,00:31:18.650,The wedding will be hosted by Consort Estime.
00:31:19.250,00:31:21.280,甄府从前的丫鬓纷儿,00:31:18.650,00:31:20.960,"The maid formerly from the Zhen family, Bin'er,"
00:31:21.580,00:31:23.450,随玉隐姑娘入府主事,00:31:20.980,00:31:23.472,will accompany Yuyin to manage the estate affairs.
00:31:25.050,00:31:26.540,我绝不会让你的出嫁之礼,00:31:24.494,00:31:26.295,I won't let your dowry be less
00:31:26.920,00:31:27.750,逊于沛国公府,00:31:26.320,00:31:27.820,than that of the Duke of Pei's daughter.
00:31:28.420,00:31:29.410,日后低人一等,00:31:27.820,00:31:29.740,You won't feel inferior before her.
00:31:30.340,00:31:31.170,多谢小主,00:31:29.740,00:31:31.103,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:31:32.590,00:31:34.380,婚期定在六月初四,00:31:31.990,00:31:34.160,The wedding date is set for the 4th of the 6th month.
00:31:34.760,00:31:35.500,娘娘的父母,,,
00:31:35.810,00:31:38.170,很快就能被安排入宫相见,00:31:34.160,00:31:37.822,"Soon it will be arranged for Your Noble Highness's
parents to visit the palace."
00:31:50.450,00:31:51.150,嬛儿,00:31:49.850,00:31:51.040,Huan'er.
00:31:54.950,00:31:56.360,给父亲母亲请安,00:31:54.350,00:31:56.100,Peace to father and mother.
00:31:56.990,00:31:58.610,给贵妃娘娘请安,00:31:56.390,00:31:58.274,Peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:32:00.120,00:32:00.910,贵妃娘娘,00:31:59.520,00:32:00.942,Your Noble Highness
00:32:01.870,00:32:03.740,不可行此大礼呀,00:32:01.270,00:32:03.850,cannot bow to us like this.
00:32:06.250,00:32:07.080,女儿不孝,00:32:05.650,00:32:07.416,Forgive me for being unfilial.
00:32:08.210,00:32:09.540,背着钮祜禄的姓氏,00:32:07.654,00:32:09.606,"Bearing the name of Niohuru,"
00:32:10.420,00:32:12.130,不能在永寿宫迎接父母,00:32:09.820,00:32:12.342,I cannot receive you in the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:32:13.470,00:32:15.080,只要一家能团聚,00:32:12.870,00:32:14.870,"As long as we're together as a family,"
00:32:15.470,00:32:17.050,在哪儿不都一样啊,00:32:14.870,00:32:17.160,it doesn't matter where we meet.
00:32:17.970,00:32:19.050,起来吧 来,00:32:17.370,00:32:18.450,Let's get up.
00:32:19.520,00:32:20.600,都起来 来,00:32:18.920,00:32:20.000,"Everyone, get up."
00:32:21.890,00:32:22.760,来 起来,00:32:21.290,00:32:22.160,"Come, get up."
00:32:24.900,00:32:25.980,来 坐,00:32:24.300,00:32:25.380,"Come, sit."
00:32:35.490,00:32:36.570,一别这么些年,00:32:34.890,00:32:36.850,So many years have passed.
00:32:37.450,00:32:39.030,母亲都长了好些白发,00:32:36.850,00:32:39.080,Mother has so much white hair now.
00:32:43.420,00:32:45.030,熬了这么多年哪,00:32:42.820,00:32:44.800,"After many years of suffering,"
00:32:46.460,00:32:48.250,总算熬出来了,00:32:45.860,00:32:47.840,we finally reached the end.
00:32:50.260,00:32:52.420,当年家中败落的时候,00:32:49.660,00:32:51.971,"When our family declined,"
00:32:53.430,00:32:55.340,为父只怕连累你,00:32:52.830,00:32:54.891,I was so afraid of implicating you.
,,,00:32:55.080,00:32:56.424,We're family.
00:32:55.680,00:32:58.210,一家人不说什么连累不连累的话,00:32:56.424,00:32:58.418,We don't use such words among ourselves.
00:33:00.350,00:33:01.380,如今都好了,00:32:59.750,00:33:01.280,Now everything is all right.
00:33:01.980,00:33:03.590,连玉隐都要嫁人了,00:33:01.380,00:33:03.255,And now Yuyin is going to marry.
00:33:05.020,00:33:07.600,玉隐能有今天的归宿,00:33:04.420,00:33:07.000,Yuyin marrying into a good family -
00:33:09.110,00:33:09.940,她娘,00:33:08.510,00:33:09.718,her mother
00:33:11.820,00:33:15.690,在九泉之下也能瞑目了,00:33:11.220,00:33:15.090,"can now rest in peace ""under the Nine Springs."""
00:33:17.200,00:33:18.150,虽为侧室,00:33:16.600,00:33:18.380,"Although she will be a secondary wife,"
00:33:19.580,00:33:22.490,可玉隐是真心喜欢王爷,00:33:18.980,00:33:21.890,"Yuyin truly loves His Lordship,"
00:33:23.910,00:33:25.650,也算是了却了她一桩心愿,00:33:23.310,00:33:25.503,so this has fulfilled her wish.
00:33:26.420,00:33:28.580,这终究为难你,00:33:25.820,00:33:27.100,"Given everything,"
00:33:28.960,00:33:30.830,为她操了不少心哪,00:33:27.100,00:33:30.000,"you must have put forth a lot of effort
to arrange this for her."
00:33:35.180,00:33:36.540,父母亲住在客栈,00:33:34.580,00:33:39.400,It's not a long-term solution for you both to stay at the inn.
00:33:37.510,00:33:38.880,也不是长久之计,,,
00:33:41.180,00:33:43.970,皇上已经盼咐人正在修蓦甄府,00:33:40.580,00:33:44.500,His Majesty has already ordered the renovation of the Zhen estate.
00:33:45.100,00:33:48.010,父母也可好好颐养天年,00:33:44.802,00:33:48.746,You can live in peace and comfort as your age reaches what Heaven granted.
00:33:52.610,00:33:56.980,皇上能恩准我们进宫探望,00:33:52.010,00:33:56.228,His Majesty permitted us to visit the palace -
00:33:57.320,00:33:59.360,这已经是天恩了,00:33:56.720,00:33:59.056,this is already Heaven's grace.
00:33:59.700,00:34:02.530,哪里还敢奢望在京中长住啊,00:33:59.056,00:34:03.129,"How can we hold lofty hopes to be allowed
 to stay for long in the capital?"
00:34:03.790,00:34:06.820,能看到你和外孙们都安好,00:34:03.190,00:34:06.333,"Seeing you and the grandchildren are all well,"
00:34:07.420,00:34:09.660,为父是老怀安慰,00:34:06.820,00:34:09.060,"I feel deep consolation,"
00:34:10.340,00:34:11.790,不求其他了,00:34:09.740,00:34:11.723,and don't hope for anything else.
00:34:13.260,00:34:14.120,既然回来,00:34:12.660,00:34:14.299,"Now that you're back,"
00:34:15.590,00:34:16.300,我不会再让你们,00:34:14.990,00:34:17.514,"I won't let you be sent back to the ""barren hills and wild rivers."""
00:34:16.680,00:34:17.920,回那穷山恶水之地,,,
00:34:19.890,00:34:20.880,趁着此次回京,00:34:19.290,00:34:20.960,"While you're back in the capital,"
00:34:22.010,00:34:23.340,女儿一定设法求皇上,00:34:21.410,00:34:25.336,"I will plead with His Majesty to thoroughly investigate
 what happened back then."
00:34:24.100,00:34:25.260,彻查当年之事,,,
00:34:30.270,00:34:31.060,本以为,00:34:29.670,00:34:30.710,I thought
00:34:31.310,00:34:33.150,二小姐一直喜欢穿碧色的衣服,00:34:30.710,00:34:33.161,My Second Lady always liked to wear jade-green clothes.
00:34:33.610,00:34:36.440,没想到穿红色的更加好看,00:34:33.161,00:34:36.029,But you look much better in red.
00:34:39.070,00:34:40.730,只可惜是侧福晋,00:34:38.470,00:34:40.432,"It's a pity that I'm just a Lord Consort,"
00:34:42.080,00:34:43.190,不能穿正红色,00:34:41.480,00:34:43.232,so I cannot wear primary red.
00:34:49.540,00:34:51.580,很美 很好看,00:34:48.940,00:34:51.131,Very beautiful - You look very good.
00:34:54.300,00:34:56.210,多谢长姐为我安排妥当,00:34:53.700,00:34:55.912,"Thank you, elder sister, for arranging everything for me."
00:34:58.930,00:35:00.130,明儿就是好日子了,00:34:58.330,00:35:00.000,Tomorrow is the wonderful day.
00:35:01.680,00:35:02.840,王爷没有福晋,00:35:01.080,00:35:02.881,Lord XVII doesn't have a primary wife.
00:35:03.640,00:35:05.750,唯有一个孟静娴与你平起平坐,00:35:03.040,00:35:05.150,You and Meng Jinxian are on equal footing.
00:35:07.060,00:35:08.800,你凡事不要太忍气吞声,00:35:06.460,00:35:10.300,"Don't take any insult lying down,
but don't ""meet a knife with another blade."""
00:35:09.190,00:35:10.270,也不要针锋相对,,,
00:35:10.900,00:35:12.060,平安度日就是了,00:35:10.300,00:35:12.064,Just live your days in peace.
00:35:13.020,00:35:13.810,王爷说了,00:35:12.420,00:35:13.512,His Lordship said
00:35:14.690,00:35:16.680,王府上下的事都由你来打点,00:35:14.090,00:35:16.080,that you will manage the estate affairs.
00:35:17.610,00:35:18.570,宽严相济,00:35:17.010,00:35:18.385,Temper justice with mercy.
00:35:19.280,00:35:20.770,上下轻重都要稳妥,00:35:18.385,00:35:21.075,Treat everyone properly - from the highest to the lowest.
00:35:22.870,00:35:23.900,长姐 对不起,00:35:22.270,00:35:23.840,"I'm sorry, elder sister."
00:35:24.990,00:35:27.030,这个位置原本应该是你的,00:35:24.390,00:35:26.619,"This should be your place,"
00:35:28.460,00:35:29.620,是我占了你的,00:35:27.860,00:35:29.510,and I took it from you.
00:35:31.580,00:35:33.450,我的位子是皇上的熹贵妃,00:35:30.980,00:35:33.416,My place is as His Majesty's Noble Consort Lumière.
00:35:34.210,00:35:35.450,你何曾占了我的呢,00:35:33.610,00:35:35.491,How did you take my place?
00:35:37.460,00:35:38.700,明日便要嫁人了,00:35:36.860,00:35:38.402,You're getting married tomorrow.
00:35:39.340,00:35:40.420,要欢欢喜喜的,00:35:38.740,00:35:40.000,You should be happy.
00:35:40.970,00:35:41.670,不要多心,00:35:40.370,00:35:41.674,Don't overwork your heart.
00:35:42.430,00:35:43.130,长姐,00:35:41.830,00:35:43.096,"Elder sister,"
00:35:45.010,00:35:46.340,我知道你心里难过,00:35:44.410,00:35:46.560,I know your heart is suffering...
00:35:48.810,00:35:50.800,新娘子该高高兴兴的,00:35:48.210,00:35:50.560,A bride should be happy.
00:35:51.810,00:35:52.850,怎么能哭呢,00:35:51.210,00:35:52.665,How can you cry?
00:35:53.690,00:35:55.050,长姐 你有没有后悔过,00:35:53.090,00:35:55.040,"Elder sister, have you ever regretted ..."
00:35:56.570,00:35:57.430,如果当年,00:35:55.970,00:35:57.207,"If back then,"
00:35:58.490,00:35:59.940,能够再等几个月的话,00:35:57.890,00:35:59.717,we waited for a few more months...
00:36:01.450,00:36:02.810,今日嫁给王爷的人,00:36:00.850,00:36:05.047,Then it wouldn't be me ... marrying His Lordship now.
00:36:04.120,00:36:05.280,那就不会是我了,,,
00:36:07.540,00:36:08.570,路是自己选的,00:36:06.940,00:36:09.101,"Once one chooses a path,"
00:36:11.210,00:36:12.660,就没有回头的余地了,00:36:10.610,00:36:12.815,there is no turning back.
00:36:14.710,00:36:16.450,在这宫里活下去太难了,00:36:14.110,00:36:16.416,It's too difficult to survive in the palace.
00:36:17.550,00:36:20.080,我没有时间 也没有心思去后悔,00:36:16.950,00:36:20.160,I don't have the time or the heart for regret.
00:36:21.840,00:36:24.920,以后的路也是你今日所选,00:36:21.240,00:36:24.640,Your future path is what you have chosen today.
00:36:26.140,00:36:26.630,我也希望,,,
00:36:27.010,00:36:28.750,你永远不要后悔地走下去,00:36:25.540,00:36:28.341,I hope you will walk on without any regret.
00:36:30.180,00:36:31.140,长姐我怕,00:36:29.580,00:36:31.200,"Elder sister, I am afraid."
00:36:32.850,00:36:34.930,我怕王爷的心里永远都会只有你,00:36:32.250,00:36:35.047,I'm afraid that His Lordship will always have only you in his heart.
00:36:36.060,00:36:36.600,我都不知道,,,

00:36:41.440,00:36:43.360,方令你而言 我已是局外人,00:36:40.840,00:36:42.949,I'm already an outsider.
00:36:44.860,00:36:47.110,果郡王府中的夫妻是你和王爷,00:36:44.260,00:36:47.189,The estate is headed by you and Noble Prince Guo as a married couple.
00:36:48.450,00:36:51.240,该如何做都在于你自己,00:36:47.850,00:36:50.866,How to do anything - is up to you.
00:36:52.330,00:36:55.070,我只告诉你 真心,00:36:51.730,00:36:54.734,I can only tell you: a true heart.
00:36:56.170,00:36:57.250,真心最要紧,00:36:55.570,00:36:57.367,A true heart is the most important.
00:36:59.300,00:36:59.910,长姐,00:36:58.700,00:36:59.763,Elder sister.
00:37:01.510,00:37:03.590,我会尽我所有的心力对王爷好,00:37:00.910,00:37:03.556,I will give my whole heart to His Lordship.
00:37:04.930,00:37:06.130,我会孝敬太妃的,00:37:04.330,00:37:06.134,I will be filial to the Consort Dowager.
00:37:08.100,00:37:08.960,你只要记住,00:37:07.500,00:37:09.416,You need only remember
00:37:10.180,00:37:11.470,以后你我的肩上,00:37:09.580,00:37:11.474,"from now on, both you and I"

00:38:30.550,00:38:31.710,起码他会真的高兴,00:38:29.950,00:38:31.831,At least he would be happy for real.
00:38:37.730,00:38:39.510,玉隐比我有福气,00:38:37.130,00:38:39.250,Yuyin is more fortunate than I.

00:38:49.320,00:38:50.780,可两个都不是他想要的,00:38:48.720,00:38:50.720,but desires neither.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:40.400,00:42:58.400,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:58.400,00:43:18.400,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:18.400,00:43:35.400,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:13.400,00:44:32.400,"Praying for a bright moon;
