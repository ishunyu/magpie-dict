00:02:26.680,00:02:27.270,皇上,00:02:27.680,00:02:28.270,Your Majesty.
00:02:29.080,00:02:29.630,皇上,00:02:30.080,00:02:30.760,Your Majesty.
00:02:30.800,00:02:34.030,熹贵妃已经在里头候了半天了,00:02:31.800,00:02:35.333,Noble Consort Lumière has been waiting inside for some time.
00:02:38.080,00:02:39.750,传果郡王在此等候,00:02:39.080,00:02:41.243,Call for Noble Prince Guo to wait here.
00:02:41.800,00:02:44.510,没有朕的宣召不得入内,00:02:42.800,00:02:45.779,He must not enter until I summon him.
00:02:44.960,00:02:45.510,嗻,00:02:45.960,00:02:46.700,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:02:55.200,00:02:56.110,皇上回来了,00:02:56.200,00:02:57.379,Your Majesty has returned.
00:03:07.760,00:03:10.950,皇上为何这般看着臣妾,00:03:08.760,00:03:09.775,Why does Your Majesty...
,,,00:03:10.357,00:03:12.443,look at me like that?
00:03:12.600,00:03:13.910,是什么时候的事,00:03:13.600,00:03:15.040,When did it begin?
00:03:19.800,00:03:23.710,臣妾愚昧 不知皇上所指何事,00:03:20.766,00:03:24.946,"Pardon my slow-wittedness.
I don't know what Your Majesty refers to."
00:03:29.280,00:03:30.590,朕一直宠爱你,00:03:30.280,00:03:32.000,I've doted on you all these years.
00:03:32.400,00:03:33.590,可是此时此刻,00:03:33.176,00:03:34.760,"But in this moment,"
00:03:34.480,00:03:37.150,朕真恨你这张面孔,00:03:35.480,00:03:38.329,I truly resent your face.
00:03:38.800,00:03:40.830,刚才有人给朕,,,
00:03:41.240,00:03:42.910,讲了一遍昭君的故事,00:03:39.800,00:03:45.538,"I was reminded today of Emperor Yuan, who
married off his concubine Zhaojun to the west."
00:03:45.800,00:03:46.830,是摩格,00:03:46.800,00:03:48.009,Galdan said it?
00:03:48.160,00:03:49.630,摩格特意来见朕,00:03:49.160,00:03:51.047,Galdan requested an audience with me.
00:03:50.200,00:03:51.630,要朕许你和亲,00:03:51.200,00:03:53.396,He asked for a marriage alliance - to marry you.
00:03:56.320,00:03:59.190,他是什么时候看上你的,00:03:57.320,00:04:00.640,How did you catch his eye?
00:04:01.320,00:04:02.710,臣妾乃天子嫔妃,,,
00:04:03.680,00:04:04.790,怎可委身和亲,00:04:02.320,00:04:04.202,I'm Your Majesty's concubine.
00:04:05.600,00:04:06.550,摩格实在荒谬,00:04:04.680,00:04:06.600,How can I abase myself in a marriage alliance?
00:04:06.760,00:04:08.230,朕何尝不知道他荒谬,00:04:06.600,00:04:07.760,Galdan is truly absurd!
00:04:09.320,00:04:11.470,朕方才用你的话去堵他的嘴,00:04:07.760,00:04:09.499,Of course I know he is.
00:04:12.040,00:04:14.150,可是他搬出了汉元帝的典故,00:04:10.320,00:04:12.694,"I said as much to him, to silence him."
00:04:14.840,00:04:17.510,以明妃昭君来比你 要朕割爱,00:04:13.040,00:04:17.049,"But he cited the precedent of Emperor Yuan of Han,
and compared you to Zhaojun."
,,,00:04:17.049,00:04:18.779,He asked me to relinquish my love.
00:04:20.120,00:04:22.550,你这张脸这么吸引朕,00:04:21.120,00:04:23.364,"Your face is alluring to me,"
00:04:23.240,00:04:24.380,也能吸引旁人,00:04:23.668,00:04:26.166,and so it can also allure others.
00:04:25.360,00:04:26.910,朕就不应该让你见他,00:04:26.360,00:04:28.520,I shouldn't have allowed you to meet him.
00:04:27.520,00:04:30.630,明妃出塞乃是元帝毕生之痛,00:04:28.520,00:04:32.346,"Sending Zhaojun beyond the frontier
led to lifelong aching for Emperor Yuan."
00:04:32.960,00:04:34.390,臣妾是皇上的嫔妃,00:04:33.960,00:04:35.927,I am Your Majesty's concubine.
00:04:35.640,00:04:36.470,若真如此,,,
00:04:37.800,00:04:39.510,那以后皇子与公主,00:04:36.640,00:04:38.121,"If this happens,"
00:04:40.200,00:04:41.750,要如何抬得起头做人呢,00:04:38.800,00:04:42.928,"our children will hang their heads in shame
for the rest of their lives."
00:04:42.240,00:04:43.030,他告诉朕,,,
00:04:44.200,00:04:45.390,他不在乎这些,00:04:43.240,00:04:46.493,He told me he doesn't care about any of these things.
00:04:46.200,00:04:47.310,只要喜欢,,,
00:04:48.360,00:04:49.580,他什么都能接受,00:04:47.200,00:04:50.207,He'll do whatever is required to obtain what he likes -
00:04:49.880,00:04:50.710,何况是你,00:04:50.549,00:04:52.160,let alone his desire for you!
00:04:55.000,00:04:56.750,摩格若真因臣妾而起邪念,00:04:56.000,00:04:58.440,"If I'm the cause of Galdan's evil desires,"
00:04:57.520,00:04:59.790,臣妾愿自毁容颜 保全颜面,00:04:58.520,00:05:01.238,I'd rather destroy my looks to save my face.
00:05:02.320,00:05:04.670,若仅仅是颜面有何要紧,00:05:03.320,00:05:06.476,It's not only a matter of face.
00:05:06.680,00:05:10.510,大清虽然以时疫逼住准葛尔一时,00:05:07.680,00:05:11.734,"Although the plague has won the Great Qing
some time to defend against the Dzungars,"
00:05:11.480,00:05:12.910,但难保他们找不到,,,
00:05:13.600,00:05:14.990,治疗时疫的方子,00:05:12.480,00:05:15.880,there's no guarantee that they won't find a cure.
00:05:15.920,00:05:17.950,况且战事延绵至今,,,
00:05:18.400,00:05:19.990,大清的元气大伤,00:05:16.920,00:05:21.503,"Moreover, these continuous wars have
greatly depleted the Great Qing's strength."
00:05:21.120,00:05:22.230,朕问过户部,,,
00:05:22.920,00:05:25.150,现下所有的粮草集于一处,00:05:22.120,00:05:23.880,I've consulted the Ministry of Revenue.
00:05:25.680,00:05:28.470,也只能够大军三五月之数,00:05:23.920,00:05:29.600,"Even if we garner all our supplies,
they will support the army for only three to five months."
00:05:30.320,00:05:31.590,彼此僵持下去,00:05:31.320,00:05:33.724,Continuing in this deadlock
00:05:32.800,00:05:35.070,只会是有百害而无一利,00:05:33.724,00:05:37.560,"will do us ""no good but a hundred harms."""
00:05:36.800,00:05:38.710,摩格明明白白地告诉朕,00:05:37.800,00:05:39.710,Galdan told me unequivocally
00:05:40.240,00:05:43.350,只要许你为准葛尔部王妃,00:05:41.240,00:05:44.350,"that as long as I approve you becoming his Consort,"
00:05:44.280,00:05:46.470,再给他治疗时疫的方子,00:05:45.280,00:05:47.622,"and give him the remedy for the plague,"
00:05:48.680,00:05:51.310,准葛尔的大军就会全部撤退,00:05:49.680,00:05:52.640,he will wholly recall the Dzungar army.
00:05:52.520,00:05:53.430,以后每年,00:05:53.520,00:05:54.880,"And every year from now on,"
00:05:53.920,00:05:57.030,只要三千粮草 十万银两即可,00:05:54.920,00:05:58.478,"they'll take only a hundred thousand silver taels
and food supplies for three thousand troops,"
00:05:58.200,00:06:00.430,从此再不与大清起烽烟,00:05:59.200,00:06:01.920,"and will never again cause
the Great Qing's beacon towers to be lit."
00:06:09.160,00:06:10.220,臣妾明白了,00:06:10.160,00:06:11.840,"Now I understand, Your Majesty."
00:06:12.680,00:06:13.900,臣妾身为贵妃,00:06:13.680,00:06:15.538,I hold the position of Noble Consort
00:06:15.360,00:06:16.990,深得皇上宠爱多年,00:06:16.360,00:06:18.617,and have been favored by Your Majesty for years.
00:06:19.600,00:06:21.590,如今是报皇上恩德的时候了,00:06:20.600,00:06:23.200,The time has come to repay Your Majesty's heavenly grace.
00:06:23.960,00:06:25.670,臣妾不敢爱惜一己之身,00:06:24.960,00:06:27.521,I dare not selfishly cherish my own being.
00:06:27.200,00:06:28.420,但凭皇上所愿,00:06:28.200,00:06:29.760,I will abide by Your Majesty's wishes.
00:06:30.720,00:06:32.830,朕是一国之君,00:06:31.720,00:06:33.891,I'm the ruler of a nation.
00:06:34.440,00:06:35.310,但凭,00:06:35.440,00:06:36.534,But this...
00:06:40.240,00:06:42.230,但凭你自己做主吧,00:06:41.240,00:06:43.840,this is for you to decide.
00:06:45.560,00:06:48.270,臣妾不敢忘恩,00:06:46.560,00:06:49.807,I dare not forget Your Majesty's grace.
00:06:52.720,00:06:54.110,熹贵妃娘娘三思 王爷 王爷,,,
00:06:54.360,00:06:55.030,不可如此,00:06:53.720,00:06:55.360,"- Your Noble Highness, please reconsider!
- Your Lordship! Your Lordship!"
00:06:56.120,00:06:56.750,熹贵妃娘娘,00:06:55.360,00:06:56.489,It can't be this way!
00:06:57.080,00:06:58.030,虽然是不惜一己之身,00:06:57.120,00:06:59.560,"Even though Your Noble Highness can set your own well-being aside,"
00:06:58.560,00:07:00.390,可只怕会陷皇兄于不义之地,00:06:59.560,00:07:02.240,Your Majesty's reputation for justice will be questioned.
00:07:01.560,00:07:04.470,王爷 皇上尚未传召,00:07:02.560,00:07:05.760,"Your Lordship, His Majesty has not summoned you."
00:07:04.760,00:07:05.900,您是不能进来的,,,
00:07:06.360,00:07:07.070,苏培盛,00:07:05.760,00:07:07.124,You cannot enter like this.

00:07:08.400,00:07:10.990,果郡王的话没说完他也难受,00:07:09.400,00:07:12.214,"Let Noble Prince Guo finish, or he'll feel disregarded."
00:07:11.600,00:07:12.550,果郡王多虑了,,,
00:07:14.080,00:07:15.030,本宫是自愿的,00:07:12.600,00:07:14.189,Your Lordship is overthinking.
00:07:15.800,00:07:17.190,皇上并未强迫本宫,00:07:15.080,00:07:16.510,This is my own volition.
00:07:18.360,00:07:19.950,娘娘自然不愿意让皇兄为难,00:07:16.800,00:07:18.560,His Majesty hasn't forced me.
00:07:20.560,00:07:21.620,可是娘娘一旦和亲,00:07:19.047,00:07:21.560,"Surely Your Highness doesn't want to
create difficulties for His Majesty."
00:07:22.360,00:07:23.750,皇兄便会如汉元帝一般,00:07:21.560,00:07:23.360,"If Your Highness enters into this marriage alliance,"
00:07:24.400,00:07:25.310,为后人耻笑,00:07:23.360,00:07:25.120,"His Majesty will be like Emperor Yuan,"
00:07:25.680,00:07:28.190,但摩格如何应答,00:07:25.120,00:07:26.713,"""the laughingstock of posterity."""
00:07:28.600,00:07:31.390,皇兄 熹贵妃为三子之母,00:07:26.713,00:07:29.258,Then how shall I respond to Galdan?
00:07:31.680,00:07:32.390,位分尊荣,00:07:29.600,00:07:33.696,"Your Majesty, Noble Consort Lumière has a
distinguished status as the mother of three children."
00:07:33.000,00:07:34.270,若以熹贵妃遣嫁,,,
00:07:35.040,00:07:36.260,来日公主和皇子,00:07:34.000,00:07:36.040,"If Her Highness is sent off to a marriage alliance,"
00:07:36.600,00:07:37.550,若问起额娘的下落,00:07:36.040,00:07:38.909,what will Your Majesty tell the Princes and Princesses
00:07:38.360,00:07:39.790,皇兄该如何回答他们,00:07:39.200,00:07:40.790,when they ask about their mother?
00:07:41.200,00:07:41.870,况且,,,
00:07:42.480,00:07:43.910,准葛尔远隔千万里,00:07:42.200,00:07:43.400,"Also,"
00:07:44.560,00:07:46.390,日后皇兄再思念熹贵妃的话,00:07:43.480,00:07:45.226,The Dzungar Khanate is thousands of miles away.
00:07:47.000,00:07:48.220,恐怕也不得相见了,00:07:45.560,00:07:48.000,"When Your Majesty misses Noble Consort Lumière in the future,"
00:07:49.040,00:07:50.350,皇上钟爱贵妃,00:07:48.000,00:07:49.798,you might not be able to see her again.
00:07:50.600,00:07:53.060,自不愿以娘娘终身平靖胡尘,00:07:50.040,00:07:51.600,"Your Majesty adores Her Noble Highness,"
00:07:53.440,00:07:54.830,若准葛尔真要和亲,00:07:51.600,00:07:54.240,"and surely doesn't want her to suffer
a life spent pacifying the frontier tribes."
00:07:55.240,00:07:57.670,皇上您何不另选才貌双全者,00:07:54.440,00:07:56.282,"If the Dzungars want a marriage alliance,"
00:07:58.040,00:07:58.830,嫁与摩格,00:07:56.282,00:07:59.680,"what if Your Majesty seeks someone else
 with talent and beauty to marry Galdan?"
00:07:59.160,00:08:00.550,这样既保全了娘娘,,,
00:08:00.840,00:08:02.470,也给足了摩格的颜面,00:08:00.000,00:08:03.600,"This will protect Her Noble Highness,
and also save face for Galdan."
00:08:02.680,00:08:03.390,你知道,00:08:03.680,00:08:05.160,You know that
00:08:04.160,00:08:07.780,情之所钟是极难改变的,00:08:05.160,00:08:08.780,"the devotion of one's heart is extremely
 difficult to change."
00:08:09.320,00:08:11.470,摩格既然敢要熹贵妃,00:08:10.320,00:08:12.560,"Since he dared to ask for Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:08:12.440,00:08:13.950,必是志在必得,00:08:13.216,00:08:15.308,he must have his heart set on her.
00:08:15.160,00:08:18.430,你以为能再遣嫁他人,00:08:16.160,00:08:17.440,Do you think
00:08:18.840,00:08:21.270,就能令摩格满意退却吗,00:08:17.766,00:08:22.240,"sending someone else will satisfy Galdan
 enough to back down?"
00:08:22.240,00:08:24.270,这儿没你的事 你先下去吧,00:08:23.240,00:08:25.680,Your service is not needed here. You may go now.
00:08:24.680,00:08:25.310,嗻,00:08:25.680,00:08:26.538,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:08:29.400,00:08:30.070,旁人也好,,,
00:08:30.800,00:08:31.830,熹贵妃也好,00:08:30.400,00:08:33.470,"Whether it is Noble Consort Lumière or someone else,"
00:08:32.920,00:08:34.510,皆是牺牲女子保卫家园,00:08:33.696,00:08:36.228,this is sacrificing a woman's life to protect our homeland.
00:08:35.400,00:08:36.310,有何分别,00:08:36.400,00:08:37.693,What difference does it make?
00:08:37.440,00:08:39.630,如果准葛尔以此为例,00:08:38.440,00:08:40.880,If the Dzungars use this as a precedent
00:08:39.880,00:08:41.390,年年要求大清索纳和亲,00:08:40.880,00:08:43.042,"and request a marriage alliance every year,"
00:08:42.000,00:08:43.750,岂不使天下女子皆受茶毒,00:08:43.042,00:08:45.120,won't all women under Heaven be persecuted?
00:08:45.080,00:08:47.310,大清的颜面何在,00:08:46.080,00:08:48.640,Where is the dignity of the Great Qing?
00:08:48.400,00:08:50.230,臣弟以为不妥,00:08:49.400,00:08:51.588,"I don't think it is a proper decision, Your Majesty."
00:08:51.880,00:08:54.470,是朕被蒙在鼓里,00:08:52.877,00:08:56.106,"I was blindsided,"
00:08:55.840,00:08:58.270,连摩格什么时候注意到熹贵妃,,,
00:08:58.640,00:08:59.950,朕都惜懂不知,00:08:56.840,00:09:00.772,"not even noticing when Noble Consort Lumière
caught Galdan's eye."
00:09:00.320,00:09:03.350,以致颜面尽失 进退两难,00:09:01.320,00:09:04.350,"Now, I am already deep in this dilemma
 and have lost all dignity."
00:09:03.600,00:09:06.160,皇兄 咱不是打不过准葛尔,00:09:04.600,00:09:07.320,"Your Majesty, it's not that we can't defeat the Dzungars!"
00:09:06.400,00:09:10.550,你以为朕就能舍得熹贵妃吗,00:09:07.400,00:09:09.184,Do you think I can ...
,,,00:09:09.412,00:09:12.091,bear to give away Noble Consort Lumière?
00:09:14.080,00:09:15.510,咱们不是不能打,00:09:15.080,00:09:16.734,"It's not that we cannot fight,"
00:09:17.560,00:09:19.630,是不能一直这样打下去,00:09:18.560,00:09:20.899,but we cannot be fighting wars like this forever.
00:09:21.080,00:09:22.190,如今的情势,00:09:22.080,00:09:23.520,"In the current situation,"
00:09:22.760,00:09:25.630,你以为我大清还有多少良将可用,00:09:23.760,00:09:26.988,how many capable generals do you think we still have?
00:09:31.680,00:09:34.750,汉家青史上最计拙是和亲,00:09:32.680,00:09:36.563,"The most foolish tactic in the Han Dynasty's history
was the marriage alliance."
00:09:36.040,00:09:37.550,皇兄如果不嫌臣弟无用,00:09:37.040,00:09:38.863,"If Your Majesty doesn't despise my incompetence,"
00:09:39.240,00:09:40.510,臣弟愿领兵出关,,,
00:09:41.000,00:09:42.390,不退准葛尔绝不还朝,00:09:40.240,00:09:42.000,I will lead troops to the frontier
,,,00:09:42.000,00:09:43.937,and not return until the Dzungars are defeated!
00:09:52.440,00:09:53.270,你告诉朕,00:09:53.440,00:09:54.640,"Tell me,"
00:09:54.760,00:09:56.830,你这个请求是为了大清,00:09:55.760,00:09:58.054,"is your request made for the Great Qing,"
00:09:57.880,00:09:58.830,还是为了她,00:09:58.880,00:10:00.000,or for her?
00:10:07.640,00:10:08.990,皇兄原来费尽心思,00:10:08.640,00:10:10.720,Your Majesty has gone through so much trouble
00:10:09.760,00:10:12.470,是为引臣弟说出这句话来,00:10:10.760,00:10:13.470,just to hear me say this.
00:10:18.400,00:10:20.750,你一向谨慎小心,00:10:19.400,00:10:22.377,You have always been humble and cautious.
00:10:23.720,00:10:24.990,可是听到了,,,
00:10:25.200,00:10:28.150,朕允许熹贵妃嫁到准葛尔,00:10:24.720,00:10:29.449,"But when you heard I approved marrying off
 Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:10:28.440,00:10:29.420,便贸然闯殿,00:10:29.520,00:10:31.036,you recklessly burst into the hall.
00:10:31.280,00:10:35.750,你一向对朝政甚少注目,00:10:32.280,00:10:37.198,"You rarely pay attention to state affairs,"
00:10:37.200,00:10:41.310,你也知道朕一向不喜亲王领兵,00:10:38.200,00:10:42.579,and you know that I dislike having princes lead the military.
00:10:43.360,00:10:44.790,可是你为了她,00:10:44.360,00:10:46.283,"But for her,"
00:10:46.680,00:10:49.470,还是向朕领兵抗衡准葛尔,00:10:47.680,00:10:50.828,you request to lead troops against the Dzungars.
00:10:52.280,00:10:54.740,朕只恨自己从前瞎了眼睛,00:10:53.280,00:10:56.456,"I blame only myself for my blindness,"
00:10:56.200,00:10:58.150,不曾看出你们二人的私情,00:10:57.200,00:10:59.480,not seeing the affair between the two of you!
00:10:58.480,00:10:59.270,皇兄误会了,00:10:59.480,00:11:01.056,Your Majesty is mistaken!
00:11:01.840,00:11:03.790,若不是你今日贸然闯殿,00:11:02.840,00:11:05.417,"Had you not recklessly burst into the hall today,"
00:11:04.840,00:11:08.430,朕断然不能相信旁人所言,00:11:05.616,00:11:09.430,I would never believe what I was told -
00:11:08.760,00:11:10.390,说你二人曾在宫外私会,00:11:09.600,00:11:12.003,that you two had met privately outside the palace!
00:11:15.800,00:11:18.070,是朕惜然不知,00:11:16.800,00:11:19.070,It was my fault for being oblivious.
00:11:23.000,00:11:26.910,你很好,00:11:24.000,00:11:26.048,And you....
,,,00:11:27.304,00:11:29.166,Very well!
00:11:28.520,00:11:29.150,皇兄,00:11:29.520,00:11:30.340,Your Majesty!
00:11:30.480,00:11:31.990,熹贵妃一向谨守宫礼,00:11:31.400,00:11:33.600,"Noble Consort Lumière always respectfully
 follows palace protocol."
00:11:33.280,00:11:34.630,是臣弟轻纵无礼,00:11:34.280,00:11:36.078,I was being reckless.
00:11:35.880,00:11:37.910,刚才臣弟闯殿的确失礼至极,00:11:36.880,00:11:39.200,Barging into the hall was most inappropriate.
00:11:38.200,00:11:39.340,可臣弟乃是大清的子民,,,
00:11:39.720,00:11:41.070,实在是不忍心看大清,00:11:39.200,00:11:40.720,But I am a son of the Great Qing!
00:11:41.440,00:11:43.310,受准葛尔强求要挟之辱,00:11:40.720,00:11:44.577,"I cannot bear to see the Great Qing
coerced and humiliated by the Dzungars!"
00:11:45.320,00:11:46.380,臣弟虽然无能,,,
00:11:47.440,00:11:48.630,但既受亲王傣禄,00:11:46.320,00:11:48.320,"Although I am incompetent,"
00:11:48.880,00:11:51.030,就应当为国家效力 死而后已,00:11:48.320,00:11:52.320,"I receive stipends as a Noble Prince
and must devote my entire life to the country!"
00:11:53.840,00:11:54.710,你继续说,00:11:54.840,00:11:55.934,Keep going.
00:11:55.520,00:11:57.790,皇兄猜测种种臣弟也明白,00:11:56.520,00:11:59.685,"I understand Your Majesty may have presumptions,"
00:11:59.920,00:12:02.790,都是皇兄太在意熹贵妃的缘故,00:12:00.920,00:12:04.160,"but that's because Your Majesty cares so
 exceedingly for Noble Consort Lumière."
00:12:06.840,00:12:07.870,恭喜熹贵妃了,00:12:07.840,00:12:09.811,This is due to Your Noble Highness's merit.
00:12:09.920,00:12:10.710,可这两年,00:12:10.920,00:12:12.475,Over the past years
00:12:11.720,00:12:13.790,朕耳朵里落了不少闲话,00:12:12.720,00:12:15.040,"I have heard quite a bit of idle talk,"
00:12:15.320,00:12:17.550,说你自从娶了玉福晋,00:12:16.320,00:12:19.087,"saying that ever since you married Lord Consort Yuyin,"
00:12:18.520,00:12:20.750,便一直两情不睦,00:12:19.520,00:12:22.332,you two have been at odds with each other.
00:12:23.440,00:12:25.740,连皇兄都为后宫的事情而烦恼,00:12:24.440,00:12:27.461,Even Your Majesty is troubled by the affairs in the harem.
00:12:26.840,00:12:28.510,必然能够体会到臣弟站在,,,
00:12:30.120,00:12:31.990,玉隐和静娴中间的不易呀,00:12:27.840,00:12:32.880,"You can surely understand my difficulties
between Yuyin and Jingxian."
00:12:32.640,00:12:34.790,情深而起妒 妒切而生疑,00:12:33.320,00:12:37.262,"Deep affection gives rise to jealousy,
and intense jealousy leads to suspicion."
00:12:35.360,00:12:39.110,不和睦实在是情之过切,00:12:38.327,00:12:40.800,Disharmony comes from the deepest care.
00:12:41.560,00:12:45.340,其实夫妇间最怕的就是疑心,00:12:42.560,00:12:46.877,"In fact, the greatest danger for a couple is suspicion."
00:12:47.040,00:12:49.150,臣妾不怕为大清受些折辱,00:12:48.040,00:12:50.777,"I'm not afraid to endure humiliation
for the sake of the Great Qing."
00:12:50.160,00:12:51.710,可前有温太医之事,00:12:51.160,00:12:53.203,"But with the previous incident with Dr. Wen,"
00:12:52.840,00:12:54.230,今日又涉及王爷,00:12:53.840,00:12:56.174,"and today's matter implicating His Lordship,"
00:12:56.000,00:12:58.150,臣妾实在不能不心灰意冷,00:12:57.000,00:12:59.416,My heart cannot help but feel as cold as ashes.
00:12:58.720,00:12:59.830,心灰意冷,00:12:59.720,00:13:01.233,Cold as ashes?
00:13:02.600,00:13:05.870,朕曾有一转念的疑心,00:13:03.600,00:13:07.200,I had a moment of doubt in my mind.
00:13:07.640,00:13:11.420,老十七是因小像一事娶玉隐,00:13:08.640,00:13:12.957,Yunli married Yuyin because of the cutout paper portrait.
00:13:12.360,00:13:15.510,那张小像的确很像玉隐,00:13:13.360,00:13:17.003,The portrait did resemble Yuyin.
00:13:16.360,00:13:18.430,但若说像你也无不可,00:13:17.280,00:13:20.000,But it could also be said to resemble you.
00:13:20.920,00:13:23.110,朕真不敢再想下去了,00:13:21.920,00:13:24.110,I don't dare to think further.
00:13:23.920,00:13:25.510,皇兄实属多虑了,00:13:24.920,00:13:26.823,Your Majesty is overthinking.
00:13:28.240,00:13:29.380,是朕多虑了,00:13:29.240,00:13:30.935,I am thinking too much indeed.
00:13:32.360,00:13:37.150,熹贵妃有心也好 无意也罢,00:13:33.360,00:13:38.560,"Whether it was Noble Consort Lumière's intention or not,"
00:13:38.960,00:13:40.510,横在我们兄弟之间,00:13:39.800,00:13:42.240,her presence created a rift between us brothers
00:13:42.760,00:13:45.030,又外惹他人凯觑,00:13:43.760,00:13:46.254,and attracted covetousness from an outsider.
00:13:45.960,00:13:46.870,实是祸水,00:13:46.800,00:13:48.608,"She is trouble like ""an ominous flood."""
00:13:48.440,00:13:51.270,朕便从摩格之求,00:13:49.440,00:13:52.270,"I will grant Galdan's request,"
00:13:53.160,00:13:54.710,送她远离大清,00:13:54.160,00:13:56.090,and send her away from the Great Qing.
00:13:56.720,00:13:59.550,许准葛尔和亲,00:13:57.720,00:14:00.774,I approve of the marriage alliance with the Dzungars.
00:14:02.400,00:14:03.540,还请皇兄三思啊,00:14:03.400,00:14:04.800,"Please reconsider, Your Majesty!"
00:14:03.800,00:14:05.830,朕意已决 不会再改,00:14:04.800,00:14:07.188,"My mind is made up, and will not be changed."

00:15:29.960,00:15:30.870,你先下去吧,00:15:30.960,00:15:32.183,You may leave now.
00:15:32.040,00:15:32.630,是,00:15:33.040,00:15:33.984,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:15:45.040,00:15:45.790,朕问你,00:15:46.040,00:15:47.535,Let me ask you this:
00:15:47.760,00:15:50.910,答允和亲后你怎样打算,00:15:48.760,00:15:50.582,You have agreed to the marriage alliance.
,,,00:15:50.582,00:15:52.403,How will you conduct yourself?
00:15:51.920,00:15:54.910,臣妾不敢被他人所辱,00:15:52.920,00:15:54.847,I dare not endure
00:15:56.840,00:15:58.060,连累皇上清誉,00:15:55.020,00:15:56.104,any humiliation...
,,,00:15:57.480,00:16:00.113,that would tarnish Your Majesty's reputation.
00:16:02.720,00:16:04.030,朕不是汉元帝,00:16:03.720,00:16:05.612,"I am not Emperor Yuan,"
00:16:05.280,00:16:07.990,也不希望你做有去无回的昭君,00:16:06.280,00:16:09.393,"nor do I want you to be another Zhaojun
that never returns."
00:16:09.920,00:16:13.590,即便老十七对你有什么不轨之心,00:16:10.920,00:16:15.306,"Even if my seventeenth brother
has any improper intentions toward you,"
00:16:15.480,00:16:17.430,朕也不会真生他的气,00:16:16.480,00:16:18.833,I will not truly hold a grudge against him.
00:16:19.160,00:16:21.910,爱美之心人皆有之,00:16:20.160,00:16:23.737,"""Love for beauty is only human."""
00:16:23.640,00:16:26.470,也难怪他们垂涎于你的美色,00:16:24.640,00:16:27.470,It is understandable that they covet your beauty.
00:16:27.560,00:16:28.310,只是,00:16:28.560,00:16:29.980,"However,"
00:16:29.760,00:16:32.430,不管旁人如何爱慕你的美色,00:16:30.625,00:16:33.683,"no matter how much others admire your beauty,"
00:16:33.280,00:16:37.190,你的心只能在朕这里,00:16:34.280,00:16:38.817,your heart can only belong to me.
00:16:48.120,00:16:50.150,皇上昨夜就下旨说姐姐病重,00:16:48.807,00:16:51.440,"His Majesty issued an edict last night
saying my sister is gravely ill"
00:16:50.440,00:16:51.230,还不许看望,00:16:51.440,00:16:52.678,and visiting her is forbidden.
00:16:53.240,00:16:54.990,称病不说 还不许探视,00:16:54.240,00:16:56.462,"Claiming an illness, and also forbidding visitors -"
00:16:56.000,00:16:58.510,皇上如此 形同软禁,00:16:57.000,00:16:59.510,this is no different than confining her.
00:17:01.080,00:17:04.070,皇上如此是意在和亲了,00:17:02.080,00:17:05.563,"It seems that His Majesty is intending
to proceed with the marriage alliance."
00:17:05.480,00:17:07.190,熹贵妃一旦被送出关外,00:17:06.480,00:17:08.640,"As soon as Noble Consort Lumière passes the border,"
00:17:08.640,00:17:10.470,皇上便会为熹贵妃发丧,00:17:09.640,00:17:11.680,His Majesty will announce her death.
00:17:12.200,00:17:15.550,从此以后再无此人,00:17:13.200,00:17:17.043,She will be... no more.
00:17:20.040,00:17:21.950,这里是圆明园一切都不方便,00:17:20.816,00:17:23.320,What an inconvenience that we're here in the Summer Palace.
00:17:22.320,00:17:23.590,若十七哥的消息准确,00:17:23.320,00:17:25.160,"If your source is reliable,"
00:17:24.160,00:17:26.750,我们一定要先回王府 再从长计议,00:17:25.160,00:17:28.287,we must first return home and then make a careful plan.
00:17:29.720,00:17:31.790,御驾这两日也要回宫,00:17:30.496,00:17:32.969,His Majesty will also return to the palace in a day or two.
00:17:34.560,00:17:35.590,那咱们就即刻回府,00:17:35.560,00:17:37.127,Let's go right away.
00:17:44.320,00:17:45.750,也不知他怎么样了,00:17:45.320,00:17:47.287,I wish I knew how he has been.
00:17:47.280,00:17:49.710,娘娘自己都被关在这里不通消息,00:17:48.280,00:17:51.426,Your Highness still cares about Lord XVII
00:17:50.800,00:17:52.150,还能关心十七爷,00:17:51.800,00:17:54.046,even when you are confined and kept in the dark.
00:17:54.280,00:17:56.030,我怕允礼会沉不住性子,00:17:55.280,00:17:57.768,I'm afraid Yunli may lose control of his temper.
00:17:58.600,00:18:00.190,昨日我向皇上拜别,00:17:59.600,00:18:01.980,"Yesterday, when I bid farewell to His Majesty,"
00:18:01.360,00:18:03.230,并非是要皇上郎君千岁,00:18:02.360,00:18:04.991,"I was not wishing for His Majesty's longevity,"
00:18:04.680,00:18:05.820,而是希望允礼,,,
00:18:06.440,00:18:07.910,不要再为我失了分寸,00:18:05.680,00:18:09.497,"but instead hoping Yunli will not lose his composure again, because of me."
00:18:09.760,00:18:10.980,我如何都不要紧,00:18:10.760,00:18:12.480,"I don't mind what would happen to me,"
00:18:11.960,00:18:13.350,却不能再连累他了,00:18:12.960,00:18:14.798,but I can't let him be another victim.
00:18:16.120,00:18:20.030,这皇上也太狠心了,00:18:17.120,00:18:18.730,His Majesty...
,,,00:18:19.609,00:18:21.909,is so cruel-hearted.
00:18:22.080,00:18:25.270,修成玉颜色 卖与帝王家,00:18:23.080,00:18:26.583,"""Burnished until the complexion is lustrous as jade,
and sold to the imperial house."""
00:18:26.640,00:18:28.510,一并连性命都是皇上的,00:18:27.640,00:18:29.920,Even my life is held in His Majesty's hands.
00:18:30.120,00:18:31.590,所谓恩宠眷爱,00:18:31.120,00:18:33.083,"The supposed ""favor and affection"""
00:18:32.400,00:18:35.190,总也比不上江山前程 社稷安稳,00:18:33.400,00:18:36.906,cannot compare to the future of the nation and the peace of society.
00:18:36.880,00:18:39.180,我若真开口要皇上垂怜回护,00:18:37.880,00:18:40.583,"Had I asked His Majesty for his pity and protection,"
00:18:40.320,00:18:41.750,那才真是自不量力,00:18:41.320,00:18:43.108,I would have truly overvalued my worth.
00:18:43.160,00:18:46.750,奴婢瞧娘娘有自弃之意了,00:18:44.160,00:18:47.750,I see Your Highness... plans to give up on yourself.
00:18:49.120,00:18:50.470,皇上已经疑心,00:18:50.120,00:18:51.918,His Majesty already has suspicions.
00:18:52.440,00:18:54.670,我与他之间必有一人不能保全,00:18:53.440,00:18:56.163,"Between Yunli and I, one of us cannot be saved."
00:18:56.120,00:18:58.870,若是他 宁愿是我,00:18:57.120,00:19:00.440,"Instead of him, I'd rather it be me."
00:18:59.560,00:19:01.470,娘娘万万不可作此愚见哪,00:19:00.560,00:19:02.694,Your Highness must not have such somber thoughts.
00:19:03.120,00:19:04.030,若是他死,00:19:04.120,00:19:05.343,"If he dies,"
00:19:05.360,00:19:07.710,果郡王府上下势必不能保全,00:19:06.360,00:19:09.113,no one from his household will be able to survive.
00:19:09.040,00:19:10.070,可若我死,00:19:10.040,00:19:11.374,"But if I die,"
00:19:11.640,00:19:13.870,皇上到底还会顾及那些孩子,00:19:12.640,00:19:15.094,"His Majesty, in the end, will consider the children"
00:19:14.640,00:19:15.830,不会赶尽杀绝,00:19:15.640,00:19:17.423,and will not try to eliminate all of them.
00:19:17.960,00:19:18.990,且你以为,00:19:18.960,00:19:20.639,And what makes you think
00:19:20.120,00:19:23.510,若他死了 我还能活吗,00:19:21.120,00:19:24.823,"that if he dies, I can continue to live?"
00:19:24.040,00:19:25.590,可是就算娘娘遭此不测,00:19:25.040,00:19:26.948,"But if misfortune befalls Your Highness,"
00:19:26.240,00:19:27.830,那王爷也定会如此的,00:19:27.240,00:19:28.960,His Lordship will also feel the same.
00:19:29.040,00:19:29.790,所以,00:19:30.040,00:19:31.094,And so
00:19:32.440,00:19:33.790,我会极力保全,00:19:33.440,00:19:35.103,I'll do my utmost to preserve what I can.

00:20:03.320,00:20:03.990,王爷,,,
00:20:05.080,00:20:05.750,你不要去,00:20:04.320,00:20:05.180,Your Lordship!
00:20:07.920,00:20:08.630,我心已决,00:20:06.080,00:20:07.188,You can't go.
00:20:11.000,00:20:11.630,王爷,00:20:08.920,00:20:10.000,I have decided.
00:20:12.720,00:20:13.990,皇上的疑心病那么重,00:20:12.000,00:20:12.800,"Your Lordship,"
00:20:15.120,00:20:16.790,你已经忍了他那么长时间了,00:20:13.720,00:20:15.482,His Majesty's suspicions are deeply rooted.
00:20:17.520,00:20:18.910,为什么要在这最紧要的关头,00:20:16.120,00:20:18.056,"After so many years of forbearance,"
00:20:19.160,00:20:19.990,以身犯险呢,00:20:18.520,00:20:20.880,why risk yourself at this critical juncture?
00:20:21.080,00:20:23.350,你知道的 无须多问,00:20:22.080,00:20:24.800,You know the reason. No need to ask more.
00:20:26.760,00:20:27.350,王爷,00:20:27.760,00:20:28.669,"Your Lordship,"
00:20:29.960,00:20:31.270,你就那么在意长姐,00:20:30.960,00:20:32.612,do you care so much for Elder Sister
00:20:33.200,00:20:34.990,在意到连自己的命都不要了吗,00:20:34.200,00:20:36.119,that you don't care for your own life?
00:20:35.320,00:20:38.390,她为了保全我 可以牺牲自己,00:20:36.320,00:20:39.390,"To protect me, she offered to sacrifice herself."
00:20:39.840,00:20:40.350,我也是,,,
00:20:40.800,00:20:42.070,她哪里是为了保全你,00:20:40.840,00:20:41.760,I would do the same.
00:20:42.360,00:20:43.550,她是为了保全她自己,00:20:41.800,00:20:43.200,But she wasn't protecting you!
00:20:44.280,00:20:45.710,不和亲就只有死路一条,00:20:43.360,00:20:44.550,She was protecting herself!
00:20:46.640,00:20:47.990,和亲或许还能活命,00:20:45.280,00:20:47.520,Refusing the marriage alliance would only lead to her death
00:20:49.600,00:20:50.740,王爷 难道你还不知道,00:20:47.640,00:20:49.680,while accepting it may give her a chance to live.
00:20:51.120,00:20:51.950,长姐的脾气吗,00:20:50.455,00:20:52.663,"Your Lordship, don't you know how she is?"
00:20:53.440,00:20:55.630,当初她在得知你的死讯没多久,00:20:54.440,00:20:56.846,"Back then, as soon as she heard of your death,"
00:20:56.240,00:20:57.030,她就回宫了,,,
00:20:58.320,00:20:59.630,你为什么还要为了她,00:20:57.240,00:20:58.560,she returned to the palace.
00:20:59.960,00:21:01.230,放弃你的平安尊荣呢,00:20:59.236,00:21:02.480,"Why do you still want to give up your
safety and status for her?"
00:21:01.480,00:21:03.110,当年的事情彼此各有难处,00:21:02.480,00:21:04.338,We both had our difficulties back then.
00:21:04.240,00:21:05.070,不必再说了,00:21:05.240,00:21:06.240,Speak no more.
00:21:06.480,00:21:07.350,我和娱儿之间,,,
00:21:08.680,00:21:09.630,不用计较这么多,00:21:07.480,00:21:10.320,I never measure actions between Huan'er and myself.
00:21:12.240,00:21:13.190,如果她有事,00:21:13.240,00:21:14.320,"If anything happens to her,"
00:21:14.280,00:21:15.590,我一生都不会好过,00:21:14.898,00:21:16.939,I will never forgive myself my entire life.
00:21:17.040,00:21:17.630,王爷,00:21:18.040,00:21:19.084,Your Lordship!
00:21:19.520,00:21:21.030,我从来都没有求过你,00:21:20.520,00:21:22.598,I have never begged you for anything.
00:21:22.760,00:21:23.980,这次我求你,00:21:23.760,00:21:25.280,This time I am begging you...
00:21:25.440,00:21:26.830,我拿我的命求你,00:21:26.440,00:21:28.089,I'm begging you with my life.
00:21:27.680,00:21:28.590,你不要走,00:21:28.680,00:21:30.000,Please don't go.
00:21:30.280,00:21:32.150,长姐她虽然是我的亲姐姐,00:21:31.280,00:21:33.409,"She is my elder sister,"
00:21:33.280,00:21:34.710,她虽然有恩于我,00:21:34.280,00:21:36.080,"and I am in debt for her kindness,"
00:21:36.400,00:21:38.070,但是你是我的夫君哪,00:21:37.400,00:21:39.200,but you are my husband
00:21:39.760,00:21:42.270,又是这一辈子我唯一爱的男人,00:21:40.760,00:21:43.442,and the only man I have loved in my life.
00:21:43.840,00:21:46.830,我宁愿为你去伤害任何人,00:21:44.840,00:21:47.830,I would rather hurt anyone else
00:21:47.720,00:21:49.350,也不愿意去伤害你,00:21:48.720,00:21:50.695,than allow you to be hurt.

00:22:04.320,00:22:05.670,可是我还是不能听你的,00:22:05.320,00:22:07.015,but I can't heed you in this.
00:22:08.440,00:22:09.990,你以为你把长姐救出来以后,,,
00:22:10.360,00:22:11.390,皇上就会饶过你们吗,00:22:09.440,00:22:12.360,"Even if you bring her back,
will His Majesty spare you both?"
00:22:12.040,00:22:13.390,你醒醒吧 王爷,00:22:13.040,00:22:14.606,"Wake up, Your Lordship!"
00:22:20.520,00:22:21.470,从我的眼睛,,,
00:22:22.760,00:22:24.630,落在她身上的那一刻起,00:22:21.520,00:22:25.440,"Since the moment my eyes first beheld her,"
00:22:26.320,00:22:27.670,我就知道会有这么一天,00:22:27.320,00:22:29.157,I knew such a day would come.
00:22:30.120,00:22:31.430,我保全不了我自己,00:22:31.120,00:22:32.602,"Even if I can't save myself,"
00:22:33.320,00:22:34.230,我也要保全她,00:22:34.320,00:22:35.532,I must save her.
00:22:46.760,00:22:47.350,皇上,00:22:47.760,00:22:48.350,Your Majesty.
00:22:48.920,00:22:50.310,事情都安排好了,00:22:49.920,00:22:51.612,Is everything taken care of?
00:22:52.200,00:22:52.950,都安排好了,,,
00:22:53.880,00:22:54.860,消息传出去,00:22:53.200,00:22:54.346,Everything is proceeding well.
00:22:55.680,00:22:57.710,果郡王府以为熹贵妃,00:22:54.880,00:22:56.378,The word has been spread.
00:22:58.000,00:22:58.980,已经被送去和亲了,00:22:56.378,00:23:00.520,"Noble Prince Guo will believe that Noble Consort Lumière
has been sent away for the marriage alliance."
00:22:59.600,00:23:00.230,好,00:23:00.600,00:23:01.402,Good.
00:23:02.840,00:23:03.710,谁都不知道,,,
00:23:05.160,00:23:06.190,那喜轿里,00:23:03.840,00:23:05.357,No one knows
00:23:07.440,00:23:08.910,其实只放了一张,00:23:06.160,00:23:08.065,"that in the wedding sedan,"
00:23:09.360,00:23:10.830,医治时疫的药方,00:23:08.440,00:23:12.019,lies only the prescription to treat the plague.
00:23:11.880,00:23:13.710,这个摩格真是胆大包天,00:23:12.880,00:23:14.710,How audacious of Galdan
00:23:14.320,00:23:17.030,竟敢求娶熹贵妃 藐视天朝,00:23:15.320,00:23:18.600,"to disrespect Heaven's Empire by proposing
marriage to Noble Consort Lumière."
00:23:18.360,00:23:20.710,成大事者不拘小节,00:23:19.360,00:23:22.141,"""Those who accomplish greatness are not bothered by trifles""."
00:23:22.160,00:23:24.510,也不会沉溺于男女私情,00:23:23.160,00:23:26.002,Nor are they fixated on romantic feelings.
00:23:26.240,00:23:30.510,朕只说给他一张医治时疫的药方,00:23:27.240,00:23:31.855,"I told him I would only send him the remedy for the plague,"
00:23:31.840,00:23:32.750,他便识趣了,,,
00:23:32.960,00:23:34.350,可是摩格始终否认,00:23:32.320,00:23:33.750,and he understood this limit.
00:23:34.840,00:23:36.830,果郡王与熹贵妃有任何私情,00:23:33.960,00:23:37.936,"But Galdan denied the affair between
Noble Prince Guo and Noble Consort Lumière."
00:23:37.120,00:23:38.950,摩格袒护熹贵妃之情,,,
00:23:39.240,00:23:40.380,朕难道看不出来,00:23:38.120,00:23:41.748,"I was not blind to Galdan's intention to protect her -
driven by his own affection."
00:23:46.200,00:23:49.190,最可气的是果郡王,,,
00:23:49.760,00:23:51.190,竟敢凯觑皇嫂,00:23:47.200,00:23:52.505,"Noble Prince Guo bears the blame.
He dared to covet Your Majesty's woman."
00:23:52.480,00:23:53.620,有不臣之心,00:23:53.480,00:23:55.137,This is disloyalty to his monarch.
00:23:56.120,00:23:58.580,你办事得力朕知道,00:23:57.120,00:23:59.580,I know you are good at what you do.
00:23:59.400,00:24:00.710,现在只看允礼,,,
00:24:01.280,00:24:04.670,会不会为了熹贵妃出关去追,00:24:00.400,00:24:06.121,"Now we will see if Yunli pursues
Noble Consort Lumière to the border."
00:24:06.160,00:24:07.550,如果他出去追了,00:24:07.160,00:24:08.550,"If he does,"
00:24:09.160,00:24:12.350,那就是千真万确凯觑朕的女人,00:24:10.160,00:24:13.600,that's the proof that he indeed covets my woman.
00:24:14.080,00:24:16.190,熹贵妃那儿奴才会派人看着,00:24:15.080,00:24:17.535,I'll have my people watch Noble Consort Lumière
00:24:17.000,00:24:18.390,绝不会走漏任何消息,00:24:18.000,00:24:19.748,and make sure no news leaks out.
00:24:20.720,00:24:21.350,好,00:24:21.720,00:24:22.350,Good.
00:24:23.200,00:24:24.310,摩格离京,00:24:24.200,00:24:25.655,Galdan has left the capital.
00:24:25.760,00:24:28.670,你也吩咐下去 明日回宫吧,00:24:26.760,00:24:29.760,Announce my decree: we return to the palace tomorrow.
00:24:29.560,00:24:30.110,嗻,00:24:30.560,00:24:31.369,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:24:35.000,00:24:36.870,十七哥 你且放心去,00:24:36.000,00:24:38.388,"Seventeenth brother, leave free of concerns."
00:24:37.640,00:24:39.940,这儿的一切我和玉娆会先瞒着,00:24:38.640,00:24:41.199,Yurao and I will not give away any information.
00:24:41.360,00:24:43.630,瞒住了一时 瞒不了一世,00:24:42.360,00:24:44.800,"You can cover for me for a while, but not forever."
00:24:45.440,00:24:46.470,到底连累了你,00:24:46.440,00:24:47.840,You're implicated after all.
00:24:49.000,00:24:51.590,十七哥 你多保重,00:24:50.000,00:24:52.935,"Seventeenth brother, please take good care of yourself."
00:24:55.400,00:24:56.070,兄弟们,,,
00:24:57.440,00:24:58.990,你们都是我的亲兵护院,00:24:56.440,00:25:00.320,"Brothers, you are all my personal guards."
00:25:00.080,00:25:02.510,此去关外危险重重,00:25:01.080,00:25:03.941,The trip to the frontier is fraught with danger.
00:25:03.600,00:25:05.070,只怕本王也会有去无回,00:25:04.600,00:25:06.681,There is a chance that I may not return.
00:25:06.440,00:25:07.310,但我仍要你们,,,
00:25:07.560,00:25:08.830,以一己之力相助本王,00:25:07.440,00:25:10.974,But still I ask you to aid me with all your strength.
00:25:10.200,00:25:12.990,是我对不住你们,00:25:11.200,00:25:14.218,I am selfish... to put you in this situation.
00:25:13.600,00:25:15.550,奴才们愿跟随王爷,00:25:14.600,00:25:16.550,We are willing to follow Your Lordship.
00:25:15.880,00:25:18.670,生死不论 全力护主,00:25:16.880,00:25:20.849,"We will disregard life or death
and give our utmost to protect our lord!"
00:25:43.480,00:25:44.150,皇上,00:25:44.480,00:25:45.378,Your Majesty.
00:25:46.080,00:25:46.870,出什么事了,,,
00:25:47.520,00:25:48.830,下面的人享报,00:25:47.080,00:25:48.215,What happened?
,,,00:25:48.520,00:25:50.691,It has been reported that
00:25:49.800,00:25:53.340,十七爷带着人马追出京城了,00:25:50.919,00:25:53.928,"Lord XVII has left the capital, leading his mounted guards."
00:26:31.800,00:26:32.780,皇上金安,00:26:32.720,00:26:34.000,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:26:33.320,00:26:34.710,皇阿玛万安,00:26:34.240,00:26:35.871,Peace to Imperial Father.
00:26:36.080,00:26:36.750,起来吧,00:26:37.080,00:26:38.000,Rise.
00:26:38.560,00:26:39.780,胧月长高了,00:26:39.480,00:26:41.240,Longyue has grown taller.
00:26:42.160,00:26:44.720,过来 让皇阿玛看看,00:26:43.080,00:26:46.012,Come here. Let Imperial Father look at you.
00:26:45.280,00:26:45.870,去,00:26:46.240,00:26:47.280,Go.
00:26:50.360,00:26:51.270,怎么了这是,00:26:51.240,00:26:52.391,What's wrong?
00:26:52.160,00:26:53.910,公主长大了 有心思了,00:26:52.821,00:26:55.480,The princess seems to have some grown-up worries.
00:26:54.480,00:26:56.990,她是前儿听说弘瞻和灵犀病了,00:26:55.480,00:26:58.111,"She heard that Hongyan and Lingxi fell ill,"
00:26:57.240,00:26:58.590,嚷着要去看弟弟妹妹,,,
00:26:59.080,00:27:00.140,谁知回来以后啊,00:26:58.111,00:27:00.000,and kept asking to go and visit them.
00:27:00.440,00:27:02.190,就寝食难安 忧心忡忡,00:27:00.000,00:27:03.518,"She has been heavyhearted since we returned,
unable to eat or sleep well."
00:27:03.240,00:27:05.800,朕也去看过灵犀和弘瞻,00:27:04.200,00:27:07.343,I visited Lingxi and Hongyan.
00:27:07.320,00:27:08.270,太医说是,,,
00:27:08.600,00:27:11.470,因脾胃不和 神思忧郁所致,00:27:08.320,00:27:13.080,"The doctors said their illness was caused
by Spleen-Stomach Disharmony and somber thoughts."
00:27:12.240,00:27:14.670,小小的人何来神思忧郁,00:27:13.160,00:27:16.386,How can such small children have somber thoughts?
00:27:15.880,00:27:17.830,定是身边的人服侍不周,00:27:16.800,00:27:19.302,It must be due to the servants' ineptitude.
00:27:18.960,00:27:20.950,朕责骂了他们的乳娘,00:27:19.920,00:27:22.353,I've already criticized their nursemaids.
00:27:21.960,00:27:24.670,弘瞻 灵犀许久不见额娘,00:27:22.920,00:27:26.120,Hongyan and Lingxi haven't seen Mother for a long time.
00:27:25.160,00:27:27.270,想额娘想得辛苦,00:27:26.120,00:27:28.652,They must be missing her terribly.
00:27:27.880,00:27:30.510,听说额娘近来重病不起,00:27:28.880,00:27:31.680,I heard Mother has been too sick to get out of bed.
00:27:30.960,00:27:34.070,胧月一不能解弟妹思母之痛,00:27:31.920,00:27:35.120,"I cannot comfort my younger brother and sister,"
00:27:34.360,00:27:36.990,二不能在额娘床前尽孝道,00:27:35.240,00:27:38.071,or care for Mother at her bedside.
00:27:37.400,00:27:38.510,所以难过,00:27:38.320,00:27:40.000,That's why I am sad.
00:27:45.160,00:27:48.470,敬娘娘和其他额娘们,00:27:46.120,00:27:51.928,"Estime and the other mothers
treat you well and lovingly."
00:27:49.280,00:27:50.590,都很疼爱你们,,,
00:27:51.200,00:27:52.150,胧月知道,00:27:52.200,00:27:53.440,I know.
00:27:52.600,00:27:54.510,昨日胧月读孟子,00:27:53.600,00:27:55.560,I was reading Mencius yesterday.
00:27:54.720,00:27:57.280,孟子曰 君子有三乐,00:27:55.640,00:27:58.520,"Mencius said, ""The person of virtue has three joys,"
00:27:57.600,00:27:59.750,而王天下不与存为,00:27:58.520,00:28:01.703,"but to rule over a kingdom is not one of them."""
00:28:00.200,00:28:03.710,父母俱存 兄弟无故一乐也,00:28:01.703,00:28:05.337,"""That his parents are alive and his siblings are at peace; this is one joy."""
00:28:04.240,00:28:08.070,仰不愧于天 俯不作于人 二乐也,00:28:05.337,00:28:09.636,"""Facing Heaven, he bears no shame; facing his fellow men, he carries no guilt. This is the second joy."""
00:28:08.760,00:28:12.270,得天下英才而教育之 三乐也,00:28:09.636,00:28:13.324,"""Guiding and educating all talented individuals
under Heaven; this is the third joy."""
00:28:12.960,00:28:14.750,胧月愿做君子,00:28:13.960,00:28:16.000,I hope to become a person of virtue.
00:28:15.000,00:28:17.270,孝顺好皇阿玛和额娘,00:28:16.000,00:28:18.320,"I'll be filial to Imperial Father and my Mother,"
00:28:17.600,00:28:18.710,照顾好弟妹,00:28:18.520,00:28:20.304,and take good care of my brother and sister.
00:28:41.400,00:28:43.030,皇上是否有烦心事,00:28:42.240,00:28:44.800,Is there anything bothering Your Majesty?
00:28:43.960,00:28:45.470,这两日一直都睡不好,00:28:44.880,00:28:47.000,You haven't been able to sleep well these days.
00:28:46.160,00:28:47.670,没事 你睡吧,00:28:47.080,00:28:48.880,Nothing. You should go to sleep.
00:28:51.760,00:28:53.830,熹贵妃在碧桐书院养病,00:28:52.720,00:28:55.040,"Noble Consort Lumière has been convalescing
at the Verdant Reading Hall."
00:28:54.680,00:28:56.150,皇上一直挂念妹妹,00:28:55.680,00:28:57.680,"Since Your Majesty is worried about her,"
00:28:56.720,00:28:59.100,就把熹妹妹从碧桐书院接回来吧,00:28:57.680,00:29:00.320,why not bring her back to the palace?
00:28:59.440,00:29:00.190,臣妾知道,,,
00:29:00.800,00:29:02.710,皇上是很在意熹妹妹的,00:29:00.440,00:29:04.511,I know Your Majesty cares for Lumière very much.
00:29:04.120,00:29:04.750,睡吧,00:29:05.080,00:29:06.241,Go to sleep.
00:29:33.320,00:29:35.270,皇上虽肯放娘娘回宫,00:29:34.320,00:29:36.720,"Although His Majesty allowed
Your Highness to return to the palace,"
00:29:36.320,00:29:38.470,但是十七爷为娘娘出关的事情,,,
00:29:38.800,00:29:39.510,还未了,00:29:37.240,00:29:41.000,"the matter of Lord XVII pursuing Your Highness
 to the border isn't over yet."
00:29:40.120,00:29:42.680,只怕皇上还是要责问娘娘,00:29:41.120,00:29:44.486,"I'm afraid that His Majesty will still
question Your Highness about it."
00:29:44.440,00:29:45.790,即便他放我入宫,00:29:45.440,00:29:47.435,"Even though he has allowed me back,"
00:29:47.480,00:29:50.590,你看这永寿宫里连个鬼影都没有,00:29:48.319,00:29:51.993,"The Palace of Eternal Longevity is empty.
There's not even a ghost here."
00:29:52.640,00:29:54.710,所有人都以为我还在圆明园,00:29:53.640,00:29:56.176,Everyone thinks that I'm still in the Summer Palace.
00:29:56.440,00:29:57.710,即便我此刻死了,00:29:57.400,00:29:59.154,If I died now
00:29:58.880,00:30:00.070,又有谁会知道,00:29:59.800,00:30:01.433,would anyone know?
00:30:01.040,00:30:03.670,皇上必定还是想听娘娘言辞的,00:30:02.040,00:30:05.000,"His Majesty certainly wants to
hear Your Highness's explanation."
00:30:04.240,00:30:07.750,所以才吩咐明日去养心殿觐见,00:30:05.280,00:30:09.120,"That's why he requested you see him tomorrow
in the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:30:08.600,00:30:10.790,娘娘要早做打算才是啊,00:30:09.520,00:30:11.790,Your Highness should be prepared.
00:30:24.840,00:30:27.350,皇上 熹贵妃来了,00:30:25.840,00:30:28.350,"Your Majesty, Noble Consort Lumière is here."
00:30:43.160,00:30:46.390,臣妾病愈 特来向皇上请安,00:30:44.160,00:30:47.549,"Your Majesty, I have recovered from my illness
and come to pay my respects."
00:30:47.080,00:30:48.470,你这一病不要紧,00:30:48.080,00:30:50.000,Your illness was not a serious concern.
00:30:50.440,00:30:53.190,倒让果郡王以为你已经和亲,00:30:51.440,00:30:54.708,"But it made Noble Prince Guo believe
you had left for the marriage alliance."
00:30:54.880,00:30:57.030,居然私自带兵出关,00:30:55.664,00:30:58.332,He led troops to the border without permission.
00:31:01.440,00:31:02.750,熹贵妃,00:31:02.440,00:31:04.054,"Noble Consort Lumière,"
00:31:05.200,00:31:07.830,他与你的情意真是不浅哪,00:31:05.941,00:31:08.960,his affection for you is truly deep.
00:31:08.880,00:31:11.950,臣妾罪该万死 竟不知有此事,00:31:09.880,00:31:13.400,"Your Majesty, I deserve to die ten thousand times
for my ignorance of this."
00:31:12.400,00:31:13.380,的确该死,00:31:13.400,00:31:14.824,You deserve death indeed.
00:31:15.360,00:31:17.350,你还有什么要辩解的吗,00:31:16.144,00:31:18.867,Do you have anything else to say for yourself?
00:31:18.120,00:31:19.430,果郡王莽撞出关,,,
00:31:20.320,00:31:21.910,为的是维护大清颜面,00:31:19.120,00:31:21.320,Noble Prince Guo left for the border recklessly
00:31:22.880,00:31:23.790,但追根寻由,00:31:21.320,00:31:23.557,with the intent to protect the Great Qing's dignity.
00:31:24.880,00:31:26.310,此事因臣妾而起,00:31:23.880,00:31:27.709,"However, I was the root of the incident"
00:31:27.800,00:31:31.580,臣妾愿领受皇上惩处责罚,00:31:28.807,00:31:32.882,I am willing to accept any punishment from Your Majesty.
00:31:32.600,00:31:34.310,朕当然要惩处你,00:31:33.600,00:31:35.310,Of course I'll punish you.
00:31:35.200,00:31:36.710,臣妾敬听天命,00:31:35.855,00:31:38.487,I will humbly obey the decree of Heaven.
00:31:37.760,00:31:42.070,朕要惩处你的并非仅仅这一件事,00:31:38.760,00:31:43.458,It's not just this matter that I want to punish you for.
00:31:44.520,00:31:46.070,只是数罪并罚,,,
00:31:46.320,00:31:48.950,倒让朕为难该从何罚起,00:31:45.322,00:31:50.000,"But to punish you for several offenses at once,
I don't even know where to start."
00:31:51.720,00:31:53.390,朕见你清瘦了不少,00:31:52.375,00:31:54.390,I see you have grown thinner.
00:31:55.120,00:31:58.270,想必是在圆明园面壁思过,00:31:56.120,00:31:59.680,"I assume that you continuously
""reflected on yourself facing a wall"" in the Summer Palace."
00:32:02.520,00:32:04.510,好啦 苏培盛,00:32:03.520,00:32:05.510,All right. Su Peisheng.
00:32:05.120,00:32:05.710,奴才在,00:32:06.000,00:32:06.710,Your Majesty.
00:32:06.160,00:32:07.510,带熹贵妃回宫吧,00:32:07.160,00:32:08.982,Take Noble Consort Lumière back to her palace.
00:32:09.360,00:32:09.910,嗻,00:32:10.360,00:32:11.062,Yes.
00:32:12.520,00:32:13.950,去看看你的孩子们,00:32:13.218,00:32:15.064,Go see your children.
00:32:15.320,00:32:18.310,你病了这些日子 他们都很想你,00:32:16.104,00:32:19.310,They missed you very much during those days you were ill.
00:32:40.640,00:32:41.590,臣妾告退,00:32:41.640,00:32:42.780,I take my leave.
00:33:05.840,00:33:06.670,额娘大安了,00:33:06.840,00:33:08.379,"Mother, you have fully recovered."
00:33:08.160,00:33:09.790,娘娘 娘娘,00:33:09.160,00:33:10.790,Your Highness.
00:33:12.880,00:33:14.230,给你皇阿玛去请安吧,00:33:13.880,00:33:15.610,Go pay respects to your Father.
00:33:15.000,00:33:15.510,是,00:33:16.000,00:33:16.600,Yes.
00:33:29.200,00:33:32.150,皇上 您用点杏仁茶润润喉吧,00:33:30.200,00:33:33.452,"Your Majesty, would you like
some almond tea to soothe your throat?"
00:33:38.320,00:33:38.950,苏培盛,,,
00:33:39.960,00:33:40.550,奴才在,00:33:39.320,00:33:40.254,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:33:40.960,00:33:41.740,Your Majesty.
00:33:41.360,00:33:45.060,朕就这么原谅了熹贵妃,00:33:42.360,00:33:46.526,Will my forgiveness of Noble Consort Lumière
00:33:46.480,00:33:47.990,会不会骄纵了她,00:33:47.285,00:33:49.599,make her feel conceited?
00:33:50.880,00:33:54.230,皇上 恕奴才说句不该说的话,00:33:51.880,00:33:55.230,"Your Majesty, please forgive me for saying something I shouldn't."
00:33:55.200,00:33:57.550,这件事不干熹贵妃的事啊,00:33:55.984,00:33:59.024,This matter was not Her Noble Highness's fault.
00:34:04.440,00:34:05.710,是允礼的错,00:34:05.181,00:34:06.900,It was Yunli's fault.
00:34:07.840,00:34:09.430,他凯觑皇妃,00:34:08.840,00:34:10.948,He coveted an imperial consort
00:34:10.200,00:34:11.340,擅自出京,00:34:11.200,00:34:13.108,and left the capital without permission.
00:34:12.560,00:34:13.540,大逆不道,00:34:13.560,00:34:14.756,Rebellion is a treasonous offense.
00:34:13.960,00:34:17.870,皇上 果郡王他不敢悖逆皇上的,00:34:14.960,00:34:18.870,Noble Prince Guo wouldn't dare to betray Your Majesty.
00:34:18.720,00:34:20.190,允礼已经上奏,00:34:19.720,00:34:21.600,"Yunli has already submitted a memorandum,"
00:34:21.280,00:34:23.190,自承擅自领兵之罪,00:34:21.779,00:34:24.893,"admitting the offense of commanding troops
 without permission."
00:34:24.760,00:34:27.990,要求戍守边关 受风沙之苦自惩,00:34:25.458,00:34:30.000,"He requests to guard the border and be punished
by the hardships of the wind and sand."
00:34:29.840,00:34:31.470,果郡王不回来也好,00:34:30.720,00:34:33.129,"It's just as well if His Lordship does not come back,"
00:34:32.320,00:34:34.150,省得让皇上看见了生气,00:34:33.200,00:34:35.040,so as not to displease Your Majesty.
00:34:34.400,00:34:35.230,你懂什么,00:34:35.240,00:34:36.907,You know nothing!
00:34:36.400,00:34:40.070,朕若为此事罚他 反而受人闲话,00:34:37.374,00:34:41.440,"If I punish him for this, it will spur idle gossip,"
00:34:41.320,00:34:43.430,让人揣测宫闹之事,00:34:42.320,00:34:44.734,speculating about the affairs in the palace.
00:34:44.560,00:34:47.790,他要请罪 朕偏要赏他,00:34:45.560,00:34:48.790,"He asked for punishment, but I'll reward him instead."
00:34:48.920,00:34:49.550,传旨,00:34:49.920,00:34:51.123,Announce my decree:
00:34:50.280,00:34:54.060,果郡王 慎贝勒忠君护国,00:34:51.280,00:34:55.534,"Noble Prince Guo and Venerable Prince Shen
showed their loyalty in defending the country."
00:34:55.000,00:34:57.300,封果郡王为果亲王,00:34:56.000,00:34:58.731,"I hereby promote Noble Prince Guo to State Prince Guo,"
00:34:57.960,00:35:00.150,慎贝勒为慎郡王,00:34:58.960,00:35:01.624,and Venerable Prince Shen to Noble Prince Shen.
00:35:01.240,00:35:03.470,果亲王驻守雁鸣关外,00:35:02.240,00:35:05.257,State Prince Guo will be stationed outside the Yanming Pass.
00:35:04.160,00:35:08.990,无诏不得回京,00:35:05.257,00:35:10.388,"Unless summoned, he cannot return to the capital."
00:35:09.560,00:35:10.470,遵旨,00:35:10.388,00:35:12.099,"Yes, Your Majesty."
,,,00:35:16.040,00:35:17.622,[Three years later]
,,,00:35:46.000,00:35:52.157,"[“This night brings a full moon and blooming flowers.
May my beloved and I eternally abide in a peaceful life.”]"
00:35:52.240,00:35:53.870,花好月圆易得,00:35:53.040,00:35:55.501,"Blooming flowers and a full moon are easy to find,"
00:35:55.320,00:35:57.310,人却不能长久相守,00:35:56.320,00:35:58.914,but a peaceful life with one's beloved cannot last.
00:35:59.720,00:36:02.430,娱儿 此时此刻,00:36:00.720,00:36:03.430,"Huan'er, at this moment,"
00:36:03.960,00:36:07.870,我希望你平安喜乐地在这月光下,00:36:04.960,00:36:09.301,I hope you are safe and happy under the same moonlight.
00:36:10.360,00:36:12.150,这些信都可靠吗,00:36:11.360,00:36:13.452,Are these letters reliable?
00:36:13.320,00:36:14.790,确认是亲笔吗,00:36:14.320,00:36:16.196,Have you confirmed they're not written by someone else?
00:36:15.520,00:36:16.310,确是亲笔,00:36:16.520,00:36:17.614,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:36:17.040,00:36:18.910,是奴才给玉福晋请安的时候,00:36:18.040,00:36:20.280,"When I paid my respects to Lord Consort Yu,"
00:36:19.280,00:36:22.190,从她妆台最底下的屉子里偷拿的,00:36:20.280,00:36:23.190,"I secretly obtained them
from the bottom drawer of her dressing table."
00:36:24.640,00:36:25.550,都在这里了,00:36:25.488,00:36:26.720,Are all the letters here?
00:36:25.960,00:36:28.070,奴才怕被发觉 只敢拿了这些,00:36:26.960,00:36:29.501,I only took these so that they wouldn't notice.
00:36:38.040,00:36:39.260,果亲王如何,00:36:39.040,00:36:40.602,How's State Prince Guo doing?
00:36:40.160,00:36:43.550,皇上 果亲王戍守雁鸣关三年,00:36:41.160,00:36:44.550,"Your Majesty, in the three years State Prince Guo
has guarded the Yanming Pass,"
00:36:43.920,00:36:45.350,准葛尔秋毫无犯,00:36:44.740,00:36:46.928,there has not been a single violation from the Dzungars.
00:36:45.960,00:36:48.630,王爷戍守边境 治军严明,00:36:46.960,00:36:49.630,His Lordship guards the border with rigorous discipline.
00:36:49.120,00:36:50.870,与将士们同饮同寝,00:36:50.120,00:36:52.160,He lives and dines alongside the soldiers
00:36:51.160,00:36:53.670,并不因亲王身份略生骄矜,00:36:52.160,00:36:54.652,without growing conceited due to his rank.
00:36:54.360,00:36:56.920,将士爱戴 无一不服,00:36:55.188,00:36:58.080,He is obeyed and admired by all the officers and soldiers.
00:36:57.520,00:36:59.150,他想邀买人心,00:36:58.520,00:37:00.538,Is he trying to win their hearts over?
00:37:00.120,00:37:00.910,臣猜想,,,
00:37:01.680,00:37:03.870,或许王爷不想落人话柄,00:37:01.021,00:37:04.956,"I presume His Lordship doesn't want to provide
 reasons for criticism."
00:37:04.560,00:37:05.870,朕看了他的折子,00:37:05.560,00:37:07.200,I've read his memorandum.
00:37:07.920,00:37:10.150,说春风不度玉门关,00:37:08.704,00:37:12.112,"It quotes a poem that says
""the spring breeze does not blow through the Yumen Pass""."
00:37:12.520,00:37:14.110,极言边关苦寒,00:37:13.348,00:37:16.079,"He emphasized the coldness
and the hardship of the borderlands,"
00:37:15.680,00:37:18.670,要朕体恤边境将士和百姓,00:37:16.464,00:37:20.000,"and asked me to show generosity for the soldiers
and citizens living there."
00:37:19.640,00:37:21.070,重新设立互市,00:37:20.381,00:37:22.560,He proposed to re-establish mutual trade
00:37:22.400,00:37:25.190,让百姓安居乐业,00:37:23.258,00:37:26.326,so that the people can enjoy a peaceful and prosperous life.
00:37:26.400,00:37:29.430,果亲王所言也有理,00:37:27.400,00:37:30.430,His Lordship's suggestions are reasonable.
00:37:30.160,00:37:32.590,再有理也无需他多言,00:37:30.944,00:37:34.001,"Even so, there is no need for him to say more than he should."
00:37:34.760,00:37:38.510,朕要他戍守边关 不是妄言政事,00:37:35.415,00:37:39.510,"I sent him to guard the border,
not to impose his opinion on state affairs."
00:37:39.400,00:37:41.350,皇上万勿动气,00:37:40.400,00:37:42.350,Your Majesty should refrain from anger.
00:37:42.560,00:37:44.030,太医嘱咐您吃的药,,,
00:37:44.760,00:37:46.910,那药忌讳动怒,00:37:43.560,00:37:48.958,"The imperial doctors advised that anger can counteract
the medicine Your Majesty has been taking."
00:37:53.200,00:37:53.990,三年了,00:37:54.200,00:37:55.352,It's been three years.
00:37:59.240,00:38:00.750,召他回京述职吧,00:38:00.000,00:38:01.750,Summon him back to the capital to report on his work.
00:38:01.560,00:38:02.310,嗻,00:38:02.560,00:38:03.500,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:38:23.840,00:38:25.950,额娘 你看蜻蜓 红蜻蜓,00:38:24.840,00:38:27.209,"Mother, look! Dragonflies! Red dragonflies!"
00:38:29.120,00:38:30.670,灵犀 你看,00:38:30.120,00:38:32.050,"Lingxi, look over there."
00:38:31.360,00:38:32.870,这湖上的荷花都开了,00:38:32.360,00:38:34.212,The lotus has bloomed in the lake.
00:38:33.680,00:38:35.590,为何湖畔中只有荷花,00:38:34.680,00:38:36.590,Why are there lotus flowers in the lake
00:38:35.920,00:38:36.950,没有别的花呢,00:38:36.920,00:38:38.330,but no other flowers?
00:38:38.120,00:38:38.950,那是因为,00:38:39.000,00:38:39.960,It's because...
00:38:39.160,00:38:41.110,荷花的香味已足够清怡,00:38:40.000,00:38:42.640,The scent of lotus flowers is already refreshing by itself.
00:38:41.720,00:38:44.710,如果再有别的花香反倒乱了气味,00:38:42.720,00:38:45.710,"If there were other flowers, it would disrupt the aroma."
00:38:55.760,00:38:58.510,灵犀 这是你十七叔,00:38:56.760,00:39:00.000,"Lingxi, this is your seventeenth uncle."
00:38:59.040,00:38:59.910,十七叔好,00:39:00.040,00:39:01.359,"Greetings, Seventeenth Uncle."
00:39:02.960,00:39:04.020,灵犀都长这么大了,00:39:03.960,00:39:05.120,Lingxi has grown up so much.
00:39:08.000,00:39:09.350,早听说王爷要回来,00:39:09.000,00:39:10.890,"I heard that Your Lordship was coming back,"
00:39:10.600,00:39:11.740,却没想到这么快,00:39:11.600,00:39:13.360,but I didn't expect it to be so soon.
00:39:13.720,00:39:14.830,许久没有回京了,00:39:14.720,00:39:16.360,I haven't returned to the capital for a long time.
00:39:16.200,00:39:18.710,归心似箭 日夜兼程,00:39:17.000,00:39:21.466,"I hurried on the road day and night.
My anxious heart wished to fly as fast as an arrow."
00:39:23.960,00:39:24.910,久未见熹贵妃,00:39:24.588,00:39:26.795,I haven't seen Your Noble Highness for a long time.
00:39:26.880,00:39:27.670,别来无恙,00:39:27.800,00:39:29.360,I trust you have been well.
00:39:28.840,00:39:29.820,托王爷的福,00:39:29.840,00:39:31.240,"Thanks to Your Lordship's blessing,"
00:39:31.000,00:39:31.790,一切无恙,00:39:31.784,00:39:33.056,all is well.
00:39:38.200,00:39:40.110,回来见过玉隐和元澈了吗,00:39:39.200,00:39:41.584,Have you seen Yuyin and Yuanchen since you got back?
00:39:41.160,00:39:42.430,急着来向皇上述职,,,
00:39:42.840,00:39:43.630,还来不及回府,00:39:42.160,00:39:43.840,I came in a hurry to report to His Majesty.
,,,00:39:43.840,00:39:45.320,I haven't had a chance to go home.

00:39:49.600,00:39:50.870,边关风霜苦寒,00:39:50.600,00:39:52.616,The winds and frost are bitter at the borderland.
00:39:52.080,00:39:53.190,玉隐每每说起,00:39:53.080,00:39:54.989,"Every time Yuyin mentioned it,"
00:39:54.760,00:39:55.870,我们都很不放心,00:39:55.760,00:39:57.498,we were all deeply worried for you.

00:40:33.440,00:40:35.550,所以特地让奴才过来看一看,00:40:33.080,00:40:36.527,"His Majesty cherishes his brotherhood with His Lordship
and sent me to come look for him."
00:40:51.360,00:40:51.990,来,00:40:52.360,00:40:53.206,Here.
00:41:03.360,00:41:04.150,老十七,00:41:04.360,00:41:05.280,Seventeenth brother.
00:41:05.920,00:41:07.510,你给朕一句实话,00:41:06.920,00:41:08.812,I need a word of truth.
00:41:09.840,00:41:14.390,被边塞的风吹了三年,00:41:10.840,00:41:15.680,"Three years in the harsh winds at the borderland,"
00:41:14.720,00:41:15.700,你最挂念谁,00:41:15.720,00:41:17.175,who did you miss the most?
00:41:20.000,00:41:20.950,额娘,00:41:21.000,00:41:22.400,My mother.
00:41:23.520,00:41:24.230,皇兄,00:41:24.368,00:41:25.446,"Your Majesty,"
00:41:25.720,00:41:27.470,臣弟是个不孝的儿子,00:41:26.461,00:41:28.772,I am an unfilial son.
00:41:28.560,00:41:30.710,你敢擅自带兵离京,00:41:29.301,00:41:32.012,You dared to lead troops out of the capital without permission.
00:41:31.240,00:41:32.590,还会记得你的额娘,00:41:32.202,00:41:33.950,Did you remember your mother then?
00:41:37.120,00:41:38.260,臣弟有孝心,00:41:38.120,00:41:39.520,"I still have filial piety,"
00:41:39.440,00:41:40.310,皇兄也有,00:41:40.440,00:41:41.792,just as Your Majesty does.
00:41:42.720,00:41:44.910,皇兄是明君,00:41:43.720,00:41:45.910,"Your Majesty is a wise emperor,"
00:41:46.400,00:41:48.110,自然不会因为臣弟之错,,,
00:41:48.680,00:41:51.390,而苛责额娘和玉隐,00:41:47.250,00:41:52.707,"and surely won't blame my mother and Yuyin
for a fault of my own."
00:41:54.400,00:41:55.870,出去 都出去,00:41:55.293,00:41:57.324,Out. All out.
00:42:05.680,00:42:06.470,老十七,00:42:06.508,00:42:07.546,Seventeenth brother.
00:42:08.120,00:42:09.670,你告诉朕一句实话,00:42:09.120,00:42:10.670,Tell me the truth.
00:42:15.280,00:42:18.980,你跟熹贵妃有没有苟且之事,00:42:16.234,00:42:20.710,Did you and Noble Consort Lumière have an illicit affair?

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.000,00:43:00.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.000,00:43:20.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.000,00:43:37.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.000,00:43:55.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.000,00:44:03.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.000,00:44:15.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.000,00:44:34.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."

shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
