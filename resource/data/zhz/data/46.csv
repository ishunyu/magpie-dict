00:02:43.240,00:02:47.480,流朱死了 浣碧若想留在宫里,00:02:44.119,00:02:45.247,Vermillion died.
,,,00:02:46.841,00:02:48.640,"Jade, if you still want to stay in the palace,"
00:02:48.580,00:02:49.620,我也可以安排你,00:02:49.339,00:02:50.699,I can make arrangements
00:02:50.540,00:02:52.950,去伺候惠贵人或者是敬妃,00:02:51.200,00:02:53.970,for you to serve Noble Lady Vertu or Consort Estime.
00:02:54.880,00:02:59.170,至于槿汐你从前是伺候太妃的,00:02:55.639,00:03:00.220,"Jinxi, you were serving the consort dowagers before."
00:03:00.220,00:03:03.960,不如还是回去吧 至于其他人,00:03:00.859,00:03:02.445,You could return to those duties.
,,,00:03:03.803,00:03:05.278,The rest of you
00:03:05.640,00:03:07.380,也各自换了差事就是了,00:03:06.519,00:03:08.259,will be assigned other work.
00:03:08.390,00:03:09.350,旁人也就算了,,,
00:03:10.060,00:03:11.300,奴婢本就下了决心,00:03:09.309,00:03:10.760,Others can be re-assigned.
00:03:11.690,00:03:12.770,是要跟着娘娘,00:03:10.867,00:03:12.418,But I've made the decision
,,,00:03:12.418,00:03:13.920,to follow Your Highness.
00:03:14.400,00:03:15.810,我只有小主一个亲人了,00:03:15.159,00:03:17.080,"After Vermillion's tragic death,"
00:03:17.320,00:03:18.730,流朱已经惨死,00:03:18.119,00:03:20.000,"you are the only family I have, My Lady."
00:03:19.360,00:03:22.480,我要和小主在一起不要分开,00:03:20.000,00:03:23.217,I don't want to be separated from you.
00:03:22.910,00:03:24.320,你们这又是何苦呢,00:03:23.429,00:03:25.318,Why would you do this to yourselves?
00:03:25.120,00:03:27.150,奴婢满二十五岁便可出宫,00:03:25.799,00:03:28.000,I could have left the palace after I turned 25.
00:03:28.410,00:03:30.030,可是这世上奴婢早就是,00:03:29.169,00:03:30.252,But I didn't.
00:03:30.330,00:03:31.870,孤身一人无家可归,00:03:30.518,00:03:33.226,I have been alone and have no home to return to.
00:03:33.330,00:03:35.370,所以奴婢和浣碧姑娘一样,00:03:34.049,00:03:36.528,"So I am intent on following Your Highness,"
00:03:36.210,00:03:37.540,都一心陪着娘娘,00:03:36.969,00:03:38.654,just like Jade.
00:03:38.960,00:03:42.170,哪怕是在佛寺也有一个照应,00:03:39.759,00:03:41.070,"Even in the temple,"
,,,00:03:41.692,00:03:43.342,I can look after Your Highness.
00:03:44.640,00:03:46.090,若是你们不怕吃苦,00:03:45.399,00:03:47.328,"If you aren't afraid of hardship,"
00:03:47.810,00:03:49.010,我也舍不得你们,00:03:48.569,00:03:50.640,I don't want to part with any of you.
00:04:06.990,00:04:11.950,妹妹 你就只有这一条出路吗,00:04:07.749,00:04:12.629,"Sourire, is this your only way out?"
00:04:12.580,00:04:14.040,我在这宫里多待一天,00:04:13.339,00:04:15.520,"The longer I stay in the palace,"
00:04:15.540,00:04:17.250,公主只会多一分危险,00:04:16.379,00:04:18.528,the more dangerous it will be for the princess.
00:04:19.760,00:04:20.620,从今往后,00:04:20.620,00:04:21.760,"From now on,"
00:04:22.220,00:04:25.380,姐姐便是公主的额娘了,00:04:23.179,00:04:26.560,Your Highness will be her mother.
00:04:38.820,00:04:43.060,你放心吧 我一定会视如己出的,00:04:39.539,00:04:40.998,I promise you.
,,,00:04:42.374,00:04:44.358,I will treat her as if she were my own daughter.
00:04:44.110,00:04:45.570,胧月是姐姐的孩子,00:04:44.971,00:04:46.755,Longyue is Your Highness's daughter.
00:04:46.410,00:04:48.320,何来视如己出这一说呢,00:04:47.009,00:04:49.400,"Why say ""as if"" to your own child?"
00:04:49.870,00:04:52.780,我相信姐姐会照顾好公主的,00:04:50.900,00:04:53.779,I believe Your Highness will take good care of her.
00:04:54.080,00:04:56.410,我知道你把这孩子,00:04:54.839,00:04:56.410,I know that
00:04:56.710,00:04:57.740,给谁抚养都可以,00:04:56.410,00:04:59.333,"you could have entrusted Longyue
to any concubine."
00:04:58.840,00:05:01.250,是你体恤我没有孩子可以依靠,00:04:59.599,00:05:03.355,"But you had sympathy for me
because I don't have a child to rely on."
00:05:06.130,00:05:10.170,也请姐姐顾念往日情谊,00:05:06.609,00:05:08.507,I hope Your Highness
,,,00:05:09.564,00:05:11.582,will take account of our sisterhood
00:05:11.680,00:05:13.140,帮我照顾好眉姐姐,00:05:12.559,00:05:14.866,and take care of Meizhuang for me.
00:05:14.310,00:05:15.140,你放心吧,00:05:15.140,00:05:16.711,"Don't worry, I will."
00:05:20.650,00:05:22.890,姐姐快走吧 省得我再舍不得,00:05:21.160,00:05:22.704,"Your Highness, please go."
,,,00:05:22.704,00:05:24.777,It's too painful leaving her.
00:05:39.960,00:05:43.580,小主 皇上赏的玉鞋可带走,00:05:40.759,00:05:41.962,"My Lady,"

00:06:37.270,00:06:38.880,让惠贵人和小主说说话,00:06:38.029,00:06:40.238,for Lady Vertu to talk to My Lady.
00:06:39.730,00:06:41.260,快些还赶着时辰呢,00:06:40.549,00:06:42.689,Be quick. We are on a schedule.

,,,00:07:03.068,00:07:05.409,I believe he will have a full recovery soon.
00:07:04.920,00:07:08.130,父亲病一好 就不宜再留在京中,00:07:05.732,00:07:08.942,"My father should leave Beijing
as soon as he returns to health，"
00:07:08.880,00:07:10.090,以免再有什么差错,00:07:09.778,00:07:11.760,in case something else goes wrong.
00:07:12.640,00:07:13.670,皇上的意思也是,00:07:13.452,00:07:15.066,This was also His Majesty's intention.
00:07:14.550,00:07:15.960,等甄伯父身子好些,00:07:15.405,00:07:17.280,"As soon as your father's health improves,"

Ningguta."

00:07:27.110,00:07:29.980,正好离了这里你也有个解脱,00:07:28.008,00:07:31.120,"You will be free, from the palace."
00:07:30.820,00:07:34.310,姐姐善自保重 我怕是再也不能,00:07:31.590,00:07:33.822,"Please take care of yourself, Meizhuang."
00:07:34.660,00:07:35.650,与姐姐彼此照顾了,00:07:34.452,00:07:37.400,"I'm afraid we will never be able to
take care of each other again."
00:07:38.790,00:07:42.120,你走了我一个人,00:07:39.388,00:07:41.440,"When you're gone,"
00:07:42.420,00:07:43.500,还有什么意思,00:07:41.920,00:07:45.014,"I will be all alone, living a bleak life."
,,,00:07:45.320,00:07:46.240,How I wish
00:07:44.460,00:07:49.040,只盼着能和你一起便罢了,00:07:47.350,00:07:49.760,I was going with you!
00:07:49.380,00:07:50.420,姐姐何出此言,00:07:50.160,00:07:52.178,"Why would you say that, Meizhuang?"
00:07:53.180,00:07:54.510,姐姐在宫中一日,00:07:53.950,00:07:56.266,"Each day you live in the palace,"
00:07:56.100,00:07:58.340,就千万要留意安陵容和皇后,00:07:56.600,00:07:59.600,"you have to keep an eye on
An Lingrong and the Empress."
00:08:00.140,00:08:01.430,不要为我使意气,00:08:00.867,00:08:03.400,Don't act on impulse because of me.
00:08:02.810,00:08:04.140,安心保重自己要紧,00:08:03.622,00:08:05.520,The priority is to protect yourself.
00:08:05.190,00:08:05.850,好,00:08:05.850,00:08:06.680,Yes.
00:08:07.150,00:08:10.980,温大人姐姐孤身一人,00:08:07.785,00:08:09.160,"Dr. Wen,"
,,,00:08:10.800,00:08:12.720,"Meizhuang is alone in the palace,"
00:08:11.900,00:08:16.190,我把她托付于你 万望顾全,00:08:12.760,00:08:14.400,I entrust her to you.
,,,00:08:16.111,00:08:17.680,Please keep her well.

00:08:21.660,00:08:24.410,莞嫔娘娘你也保重,00:08:22.418,00:08:23.818,Your Highness ...
,,,00:08:24.573,00:08:26.133,You must also take care of yourself.
00:08:25.380,00:08:27.540,我一得机会便去看望你,00:08:26.346,00:08:28.822,I will visit you once I get a chance.
00:08:29.340,00:08:30.420,一入甘露寺,00:08:30.323,00:08:32.933,"Once I enter the Temple of Pure Dew,"
00:08:32.220,00:08:34.000,大人就是红尘之内的人了,00:08:33.401,00:08:35.555,I will be separated from the mortal world.
00:08:34.930,00:08:36.040,不便再来见我,00:08:35.822,00:08:37.600,It would be inappropriate for you to visit.
00:08:37.300,00:08:38.260,大人若有心,00:08:38.260,00:08:40.266,"If you have the intention to help me,"
00:08:39.510,00:08:42.760,就请为我看顾公主 照应眉姐姐,00:08:40.493,00:08:44.000,"please take care of Longyue
and Meizhuang."
00:08:43.810,00:08:45.270,也是我如今唯一心愿,00:08:44.640,00:08:46.400,That is my only wish now.
00:08:45.770,00:08:48.060,小主不便多说了吧,00:08:46.520,00:08:47.678,My Lady ...
,,,00:08:47.856,00:08:49.856,We shouldn't talk for too long.
00:08:53.150,00:08:53.810,起程吧,00:08:54.005,00:08:55.200,Depart.
00:09:59.800,00:10:01.760,小姐我们到了,00:10:00.400,00:10:03.363,"We have arrived, My Lady."
00:10:22.830,00:10:25.160,娘子十月的山风已经冷了,00:10:23.481,00:10:26.290,"Mistress, the mountain breeze is chilly in October."
00:10:26.370,00:10:27.660,娘子刚刚生产过,00:10:27.054,00:10:28.698,You just gave birth to a child.
00:10:28.120,00:10:29.200,不要冻着才好啊,00:10:28.932,00:10:30.489,It's better to keep warm.
00:10:31.500,00:10:34.460,施主你们可是宫里来的,00:10:32.323,00:10:35.443,"Patrons, did you come from the palace?"
00:10:35.510,00:10:37.500,住持师父已经跟我们盼咐过了,00:10:36.408,00:10:38.398,Madam Abbess asked us
00:10:37.800,00:10:40.260,让我们带几位进去请,00:10:38.581,00:10:40.473,to bring you in.
00:10:41.220,00:10:41.800,多谢,00:10:40.800,00:10:41.767,Please.
,,,00:10:41.990,00:10:42.946,Thank you.
00:10:53.230,00:10:54.220,娘子来啦,00:10:54.041,00:10:55.390,"Mistress, you are here."
00:10:54.900,00:10:55.980,有劳住持等候,00:10:55.390,00:10:56.989,"Thank you for waiting, Madam Abbess."
00:10:56.400,00:11:00.440,不妨不妨 贫尼法 号静岸,00:10:57.202,00:10:58.368,It’s all right.
,,,00:10:58.989,00:11:01.280,My humble monastic name is Jing'an.
00:11:01.280,00:11:02.520,宫里来了旨意,00:11:01.961,00:11:03.399,"Per the decree from the palace,"
00:11:02.700,00:11:06.780,说娘子是带发修行 即便如此,00:11:03.399,00:11:06.400,you will observe Buddhist practice without shaving your head.
,,,00:11:06.520,00:11:08.041,"Even so,"
,,,00:11:08.041,00:11:09.280,"to practice in the nunnery,"
00:11:07.200,00:11:11.540,入寺修行 戒律是一定要守的,00:11:09.280,00:11:12.701,you have to observe the precepts.
00:11:12.130,00:11:12.740,是,00:11:12.701,00:11:13.641,Yes.
00:11:13.460,00:11:14.620,你既已入寺,00:11:14.080,00:11:16.120,"Since you have entered the nunnery,"
00:11:15.250,00:11:17.120,便不再是宫中的贵人,00:11:16.209,00:11:18.320,you are no longer a concubine in the palace.
00:11:17.550,00:11:19.580,自然要远离红尘,00:11:18.429,00:11:20.800,"You should stay away from the secular world,"
00:11:20.300,00:11:22.130,也不得再用旧称,00:11:21.219,00:11:23.800,and can't use your previous name anymore.
00:11:22.930,00:11:26.670,你就随贫尼的弟子辈用莫字,00:11:23.800,00:11:25.820,"I will give you a name that starts with ""Mo"","
,,,00:11:26.308,00:11:27.777,same as my disciples.
00:11:29.890,00:11:32.380,你眉宇之间隐有愁容,00:11:30.649,00:11:33.139,In your eyes I sense some sorrow.
00:11:33.270,00:11:35.890,便号莫愁吧,00:11:34.029,00:11:37.400,"I will name you Mochou.
[""Without Worry""]"
00:11:38.150,00:11:40.690,住持苦心 我心中领受,00:11:38.989,00:11:42.120,"I appreciate your compassionate intent, Madam Abbess."
00:11:42.030,00:11:45.150,既入寺修行是不该有人伺候的,00:11:42.749,00:11:45.960,"You're not supposed to have servants
when practicing in the nunnery."
00:11:45.870,00:11:47.610,只是宫里发了话,00:11:46.669,00:11:48.649,But I have been informed by the palace
00:11:47.870,00:11:49.910,准你仿从前舒太妃,00:11:48.649,00:11:51.320,"to allow you companions, like
Consort Dowager Serein."
,,,00:11:51.460,00:11:53.483,Pardon me. Pardon me.
00:11:51.460,00:11:56.290,罪过罪过 是冲静先师为先例,00:11:53.927,00:11:57.250,I meant Venerable Abbess Serene.
00:11:57.250,00:12:01.670,那两位就跟着娘子身边修行吧,00:11:57.889,00:12:02.748,You two may practice along with Mistress Mochou.
00:12:02.220,00:12:02.960,谢住持,,,
00:12:03.130,00:12:03.750,多谢,00:12:03.028,00:12:03.839,"Thank you, Madam Abbess."
,,,00:12:03.839,00:12:04.600,Thanks.
00:12:06.180,00:12:08.920,甘露能解世间悲愁,00:12:07.019,00:12:10.000,Dew drops can ease the sorrow of the world.
00:12:10.060,00:12:11.590,你已远离红尘,00:12:10.939,00:12:12.840,You have left the secular world now.
00:12:12.020,00:12:13.970,就将烦恼抛却了吧,00:12:12.840,00:12:15.129,Let go of your troubles.
00:12:17.610,00:12:19.100,这是静白,00:12:18.369,00:12:20.160,This is Prioress Jingbai.
00:12:19.820,00:12:22.400,她掌管本寺一应起居杂事,00:12:20.579,00:12:23.279,She is in charge of daily matters in the nunnery.
00:12:22.700,00:12:24.810,你日后有事找她便可,00:12:23.499,00:12:26.200,"You may ask her for help in the future, if needed."
00:12:26.370,00:12:29.820,时候不早了 娘子先歇息吧,00:12:27.089,00:12:31.018,It's getting late. You should rest for now.
00:12:30.540,00:12:31.650,多谢住持安排,00:12:31.419,00:12:33.240,"Thank you for your arrangements, Madam Abbess."
00:12:33.410,00:12:34.320,请随我来吧,00:12:34.120,00:12:35.360,Please follow me.
00:13:00.020,00:13:00.810,就是这里了,00:13:00.810,00:13:02.280,This is the place.
00:13:01.990,00:13:03.820,你们自己收拾收拾吧,00:13:02.789,00:13:05.138,You may clean it up yourself.
00:13:22.760,00:13:23.540,娘子坐下,00:13:23.540,00:13:24.959,"Mistress, please sit down."
00:13:25.590,00:13:26.500,小姐先坐坐,00:13:26.080,00:13:27.360,"Sit here for now, My Lady."
00:13:26.840,00:13:27.670,我去收拾一下衣服,00:13:27.378,00:13:29.258,I will put away the clothes.
00:13:28.760,00:13:29.750,有什么好收拾的,00:13:29.590,00:13:31.240,There is nothing to put away.
00:13:31.010,00:13:32.500,不过几件替换衣裳罢了,00:13:31.840,00:13:33.960,Just a few changes of clothes.
00:13:37.190,00:13:38.850,小姐的法号真是特别,00:13:38.069,00:13:39.729,"Your monastic name is so unique, My Lady."
00:13:39.520,00:13:42.180,莫愁不像是寻常的法号,00:13:40.439,00:13:43.160,"Mochou doesn’t sound like an
ordinary monastic name."
00:13:42.570,00:13:44.180,倒像是闺阁小姐的名字呢,00:13:43.200,00:13:45.320,It’s more like a young lady’s name.
00:13:44.990,00:13:48.850,住持是想告诫我 既入寺修行,00:13:45.829,00:13:47.812,Madam Abbess wants to exhort me
00:13:50.280,00:13:51.900,就不要想着从前世俗的,00:13:48.611,00:13:50.000,to forget about
00:13:52.240,00:13:53.070,忧愁烦扰了,00:13:51.031,00:13:53.792,the sorrows of my previous life now that I am in the nunnery.
00:13:54.500,00:13:55.150,也是,00:13:55.310,00:13:56.000,Yes.
00:13:57.080,00:13:58.660,从今往后最要紧的,00:13:57.919,00:13:59.779,The most important thing from now on
00:13:59.670,00:14:00.780,就是日夜祝祷,00:14:00.469,00:14:02.080,is to pray day and night
00:14:02.420,00:14:06.160,希望父亲母亲玉烧胧月,00:14:03.059,00:14:07.119,"that my parents, Yurao, and Longyue"
00:14:06.840,00:14:07.750,一生平安,00:14:07.680,00:14:09.000,can have a peaceful life.
00:14:09.050,00:14:10.590,这也是我唯一所愿了,00:14:09.729,00:14:11.800,This is my only wish.
00:14:13.560,00:14:15.050,这也是我唯一所愿,00:14:14.319,00:14:16.320,Mine as well.
00:14:18.390,00:14:20.260,小姐怎么了脸色这么难看,00:14:19.189,00:14:21.600,"What's wrong, My Lady? Your face is so pale."
00:14:23.570,00:14:24.650,娘子刚刚生产完,,,
00:14:25.150,00:14:26.360,怕是今日车马劳顿,00:14:24.171,00:14:25.850,You recently gave birth.
00:14:26.610,00:14:28.900,有些不好啊这可怎么是好,00:14:25.850,00:14:28.480,I'm afraid you are fatigued by the long journey today.
,,,00:14:28.480,00:14:29.880,What should we do?
00:14:29.410,00:14:30.650,需找些红糖来兑些热水,00:14:30.000,00:14:31.400,We need to find brown sugar.
00:14:30.950,00:14:31.900,热热地喝下去才能好,00:14:31.400,00:14:32.920,You'll feel better after drinking some with hot water.
00:14:32.280,00:14:34.240,算了这一时半会儿,00:14:33.098,00:14:34.080,Don't bother.
00:14:34.540,00:14:36.900,哪来的红糖忍一忍算了,00:14:34.441,00:14:36.006,How could we find brown sugar right now?
00:14:37.290,00:14:38.900,那可怎么行啊 月子里的病,00:14:36.360,00:14:38.000,I can endure it.
00:14:39.210,00:14:40.370,千万不能掉以轻心的,00:14:38.080,00:14:39.160,That is no good.
00:14:40.790,00:14:42.030,要不然落下病根,00:14:39.160,00:14:41.480,Illness can never be taken lightly the first month after childbirth.
00:14:42.380,00:14:43.290,可是一辈子的事,00:14:41.538,00:14:45.000,Otherwise you might suffer from a lifelong condition.
00:14:44.880,00:14:46.090,这样浣碧,00:14:45.640,00:14:46.920,"Jade,"
00:14:46.550,00:14:47.710,你好好地服侍娘子,00:14:46.960,00:14:48.400,you take care of our Mistress.
00:14:48.050,00:14:49.590,我到隔壁去找姑子们借些来,00:14:48.400,00:14:50.509,I will borrow some brown sugar from the nuns next door.
00:14:49.800,00:14:50.340,好,00:14:50.509,00:14:51.049,All right.
00:14:55.930,00:14:57.720,小姐我扶你去休息吧,00:14:56.520,00:14:58.640,"My Lady, let me help you lie down."
00:14:59.940,00:15:02.220,师父有没有红糖啊师父,00:15:00.858,00:15:03.138,"My Prioress, do you have any brown sugar?"
00:15:04.650,00:15:06.730,师父 请问有没有红糖啊师父,,,
00:15:07.110,00:15:08.100,能讨一些红糖吗,00:15:05.369,00:15:08.887,"My Prioress, do you have any brown sugar?
Can we borrow some brown sugar?"
00:15:09.490,00:15:12.190,静白师父 请问此处可有红糖啊,00:15:10.320,00:15:13.179,"Prioress Jingbai, is there any brown sugar here?"
00:15:13.030,00:15:14.690,甄嬛娘子刚刚生完孩子,00:15:13.749,00:15:15.848,"Mistress Zhen Huan recently gave birth,"
00:15:15.280,00:15:16.360,怕是一路上受了寒,,,
00:15:16.740,00:15:18.230,你可有红糖能讨一些吗,00:15:15.880,00:15:17.600,and might have caught a cold on the way here.
00:15:18.660,00:15:19.320,静白师父,00:15:17.600,00:15:19.450,Do you have any brown sugar we can borrow?
00:15:22.790,00:15:23.410,这,00:15:19.480,00:15:20.478,Prioress Jingbai...
00:15:34.180,00:15:35.510,她们都说没有红糖,,,
00:15:36.260,00:15:37.340,也没有人理咱们,00:15:35.059,00:15:38.745,"The nuns either didn't have
brown sugar or ignored my pleas."
00:15:38.350,00:15:39.380,方才住持还说,,,
00:15:39.640,00:15:41.470,是仿着从前舒太妃的先例来呢,00:15:39.309,00:15:42.600,"Madam Abbes said earlier that we would be
treated like Consort Dowager Serein."
00:15:42.060,00:15:42.890,可是这一转身,,,
00:15:43.440,00:15:44.720,就连热汤热水都没了,00:15:42.880,00:15:45.800,But now we can't even get ourselves some hot water.
00:15:48.070,00:15:49.680,那边好像还有一间空屋子,00:15:48.829,00:15:50.600,There seems to be an empty room over there.
00:15:49.990,00:15:51.150,不晓得哪个师父住着,00:15:50.640,00:15:52.440,I wonder which prioress is living there.
00:15:51.650,00:15:53.940,我再去寻寻看 你好生照顾着,00:15:52.440,00:15:54.779,"I'll keep searching. Jade, take care of her."
00:15:59.910,00:16:00.570,师父,00:16:00.749,00:16:01.409,My Prioress.
00:16:01.500,00:16:02.160,你谁啊,00:16:02.240,00:16:03.238,Who are you?
00:16:05.790,00:16:06.500,师父,00:16:06.500,00:16:07.400,My Prioress.
00:16:13.840,00:16:15.080,你是不是刚生过孩子,00:16:14.560,00:16:16.279,Did you give birth recently?
00:16:16.510,00:16:18.970,是已经第七日了,00:16:17.269,00:16:19.729,"Yes, it has been seven days."
00:16:24.400,00:16:26.260,为那些臭男人生孩子做什么,00:16:25.119,00:16:27.484,Why would you bear a child for those stinking men?
00:16:27.110,00:16:31.570,活该这个足够你喝了,00:16:27.945,00:16:28.771,Serves you right.
00:16:32.150,00:16:33.060,别再出来吵人,00:16:31.200,00:16:34.246,"This should be enough to help you.
Don't go out bothering others anymore."
00:16:35.700,00:16:37.560,红糖足足有两斤呢,00:16:36.339,00:16:38.480,This is over two pounds of brown sugar!
00:16:37.740,00:16:38.400,真的,00:16:38.480,00:16:39.400,Really?
00:16:41.620,00:16:42.860,我总以为那些出家人,,,
00:16:43.210,00:16:44.200,都是以慈悲为怀的,00:16:42.320,00:16:45.137,I always thought monks and nuns have compassionate hearts.
00:16:44.670,00:16:45.500,怎么这里的姑子,,,
00:16:45.830,00:16:47.120,说话都这么粗声大气,00:16:45.500,00:16:48.160,Why are the nuns here so brash and arrogant?
00:16:47.590,00:16:48.870,和宫里那些人一个模样,00:16:48.200,00:16:50.400,They are just like the people in the palace.
00:16:51.300,00:16:54.000,咱们是被废去位分逐出宫门的,00:16:52.080,00:16:55.280,"We were ousted from the palace
after my title was removed."
00:16:55.300,00:16:57.760,无权无势受人白眼,,,
00:16:58.100,00:16:59.550,也是意料之中的事,00:16:56.259,00:17:00.920,"Without influence or power,
it's not surprising for us to be snubbed."
00:17:00.970,00:17:04.260,刚才这位姑子虽是冷口冷面,00:17:01.809,00:17:05.099,"Although that nun seemed cold,"
00:17:05.730,00:17:07.840,却是一副难得的热心肠呢,00:17:06.529,00:17:09.200,she has a rare warm heart.
00:17:18.200,00:17:20.740,公主真是玉雪可爱很像她母亲,00:17:19.239,00:17:22.400,"The princess is as fair as jade and snow,
just like her mother."
00:17:22.910,00:17:25.150,以后胧月的额娘就是敬妃,00:17:23.589,00:17:25.829,"From now on, Longyue's mother is Consort Estime."
00:17:28.920,00:17:34.210,朕已经废去莞嫔的封号位分,00:17:29.759,00:17:31.038,I've deprived
,,,00:17:33.302,00:17:35.591,"Concubine Sourire of her rank and honorary name,"
00:17:36.180,00:17:37.130,逐出宫中,00:17:36.880,00:17:38.880,"expelled her from the palace,"
00:17:39.510,00:17:42.250,退居京郊的甘露寺带发修行,00:17:40.720,00:17:44.000,"and sent her to the Temple of
Pure Dew to observe Buddhism."
00:17:43.520,00:17:46.350,都把公主生了怎么还这么倔,00:17:44.080,00:17:47.600,"She gave birth to the princess.
How can she still be so stubborn?"
00:17:47.020,00:17:52.140,莞嫔要与朕长诀 朕不勉强她,00:17:47.680,00:17:49.678,She bid me a lasting farewell.
,,,00:17:51.764,00:17:53.355,I wouldn't have forced her to stay.
00:17:54.650,00:17:57.390,省得公主跟着这样的额娘,00:17:55.489,00:17:59.707,"I don't want the princess to learn the ways
of her mother anyway."
00:17:57.740,00:17:58.820,学得不成样子,00:18:00.000,00:18:00.874,I agree.
00:17:59.280,00:18:04.280,也是端妃已经抚养温宜公主,00:18:03.049,00:18:05.456,"Consort Honnête is
already fostering Princess Wenyi."
00:18:05.450,00:18:07.790,敬妃也算是个稳妥的人,00:18:06.249,00:18:08.589,Consort Estime is also a trustworthy person.
00:18:09.170,00:18:11.660,对了皇上莞嫔离宫后,00:18:10.000,00:18:12.920,"Your Majesty, given Concubine Sourire's departure,"
00:18:12.130,00:18:13.540,嫔女己就更少了,00:18:12.920,00:18:14.920,now there are even fewer concubines in the palace.
00:18:14.420,00:18:16.330,趁着公主出生的喜事,00:18:15.338,00:18:17.400,"To complement the joyful news of the princess's birth,"
00:18:16.800,00:18:18.340,也该封几位嫔位了,00:18:17.448,00:18:20.160,"Your Majesty should promote more
 Noble Ladies to the rank of Concubine."
00:18:21.600,00:18:22.800,你觉得谁合适,00:18:22.360,00:18:24.000,Who do you think is suited for promotion?
00:18:23.680,00:18:25.170,祺贵人阿玛有功,00:18:24.400,00:18:26.409,"Noble Lady Délice's father accomplished a great feat,"
00:18:25.640,00:18:27.100,又是满军旗贵族,,,
00:18:27.560,00:18:28.890,是合适的人选,00:18:26.409,00:18:28.320,and they are from a noble family of the Manchu Banners.
00:18:29.230,00:18:30.260,你不觉得惠贵人,00:18:28.320,00:18:29.960,She is a suitable candidate.
00:18:31.020,00:18:32.310,也可以晋封了吗,00:18:30.000,00:18:33.027,"Don't you think Noble Lady Vertu
should be promoted as well?"
00:18:33.570,00:18:34.900,莞嫔离宫正是因为,,,
00:18:35.190,00:18:36.560,性子过于倔强,00:18:34.209,00:18:37.496,"Concubine Sourire left the palace
 because of her stubborn nature."
00:18:36.990,00:18:38.440,身为皇上的妃嫔,00:18:37.869,00:18:39.473,"As Your Majesty's concubine,"
00:18:38.700,00:18:40.530,善解人意温婉川页从,,,
00:18:40.780,00:18:41.900,是第一要紧的,00:18:39.651,00:18:42.834,it is most important to be understanding and obedient.
00:18:43.370,00:18:45.530,惠贵人的性子也很倔强,00:18:44.209,00:18:46.369,Noble Lady Vertu is also strong-willed.
00:18:46.080,00:18:48.820,臣妾认为 眼下还不宜晋封,00:18:46.879,00:18:50.000,I don't think she should be promoted for now.
00:18:51.130,00:18:52.240,你看着安排吧,00:18:52.009,00:18:53.440,It is your decision.
00:19:07.730,00:19:09.760,这怎么回事乌烟瘴气的,00:19:08.169,00:19:09.535,What's going on?
00:19:11.100,00:19:12.760,静白师父在分冬天的炭火,00:19:09.713,00:19:11.336,Why is it so smoky?
00:19:13.060,00:19:13.850,偏没有我们的,00:19:11.920,00:19:13.880,"Prioress Jingbai was distributing charcoal for the winter,"
00:19:14.230,00:19:15.640,就扔了一些干柴给我们,00:19:13.880,00:19:14.880,but nothing was allotted to us.
00:19:15.980,00:19:17.350,让我们自己烧成炭火用,00:19:14.880,00:19:18.400,"She only gave us some firewood
to burn into charcoal by ourselves."
00:19:17.740,00:19:18.820,哪里有这样的事情,00:19:18.580,00:19:20.000,How could she do such a thing?
00:19:19.490,00:19:20.650,没有现成的炭火吗,00:19:20.289,00:19:21.769,Isn't there charcoal ready for use?
00:19:21.240,00:19:21.980,有是有,00:19:22.060,00:19:23.200,There is.
00:19:22.870,00:19:25.610,只是莫愁是来奉旨修行的,00:19:23.749,00:19:26.489,"But Mochou is here to cultivate herself
by His Majesty's decree,"
00:19:25.990,00:19:26.820,还是来享福的,00:19:26.809,00:19:28.018,not to be served by us.
00:19:31.040,00:19:33.620,静白师父这样烧炭火,00:19:31.599,00:19:32.763,"Prioress Jingbai,"
00:19:33.880,00:19:35.080,要烧到什么时候去啊,00:19:33.385,00:19:36.655,it will take too long to burn the wood into charcoal.
00:19:36.500,00:19:38.460,我们娘子出了月以后,,,
00:19:38.710,00:19:39.620,身子一直虚弱,00:19:37.200,00:19:40.718,"Our mistress has been frail
since giving birth a month ago."
00:19:40.260,00:19:41.340,您可否照顾两日,,,
00:19:41.680,00:19:42.670,给我们一些炭火,00:19:41.019,00:19:43.857,"Can you take that into consideration and
give us a few days' worth of charcoal?"
00:19:43.430,00:19:45.670,好歹 好歹我们娘子,,,
00:19:46.060,00:19:47.140,也是奉旨来修行的,00:19:44.309,00:19:48.307,"After all, our mistress is here
by His Majesty's decree."
00:19:48.310,00:19:49.510,奉旨修行,00:19:49.189,00:19:50.669,His Majesty's decree?
00:19:50.310,00:19:52.020,那都是说给外头人听的,00:19:51.189,00:19:53.139,That's only a line for outsiders.
00:19:52.900,00:19:54.010,咱们寺里的人,00:19:53.619,00:19:55.189,Don't bother using it on us
00:19:54.650,00:19:56.430,姑姑可用不着说这样的话了吧,00:19:55.523,00:19:57.358,here in the temple.
00:19:57.360,00:20:00.100,俗话说得好瞒上不瞒下,00:19:58.200,00:19:59.520,"As the saying goes,"
00:20:01.400,00:20:03.070,真打量咱们全是傻子哪,00:19:59.520,00:20:01.778,"""Deceive those above, but not those below."""
00:20:03.910,00:20:04.690,谁不知道,00:20:02.318,00:20:04.427,Do you really think we are fools?
00:20:05.320,00:20:07.030,莫愁是从宫里被赶出来的呀,00:20:04.720,00:20:08.400,Everyone knows Mochou was expelled from the palace.
00:20:09.290,00:20:10.950,我再有个好法子告诉你,00:20:10.000,00:20:11.829,Let me offer you another idea.
00:20:11.460,00:20:12.660,后山里头树多的是,,,
00:20:13.040,00:20:14.280,你们自己去砍些来烧柴火,00:20:12.080,00:20:13.739,There are trees on the far side of the mountain.
00:20:14.630,00:20:15.360,也是一样的,00:20:13.739,00:20:16.697,"Go chop your own firewood  -
it won't be different from this."
00:20:22.130,00:20:25.170,这儿可不是宫里要什么有什么,00:20:22.729,00:20:26.400,"This isn't the palace where you can
get whatever you want."
00:20:26.350,00:20:28.460,娘子也不再是从前的娘娘了,00:20:27.149,00:20:29.539,Mistress Mochou is no longer a concubine.
00:20:28.930,00:20:30.050,要知道自己的身份,00:20:29.600,00:20:31.319,She should know her place.
00:20:48.280,00:20:51.030,娘子娘子,00:20:49.080,00:20:50.420,My Lady.
00:20:51.870,00:20:53.280,万事求人不如求己,00:20:50.775,00:20:52.470,My Lady.
,,,00:20:52.560,00:20:54.720,It's better to rely on ourselves than others.
00:20:55.540,00:20:58.200,正是小姐身子一向虚弱,00:20:56.299,00:20:57.240,I agree.
00:20:58.500,00:20:59.540,怎么可以这样劳作呢,00:20:57.638,00:21:00.836,"My Lady, your health has always been delicate.
How can you do such hard labor?"
00:21:00.050,00:21:01.210,而且小姐一向是,,,
00:21:01.510,00:21:02.670,养尊处优惯了的,00:21:00.836,00:21:03.440,"Besides, you have always lived a gentle life."
00:21:03.220,00:21:05.050,再养尊处优也是从前的事了,00:21:04.000,00:21:06.269,"Regardless of how comfortably I've lived,
it is in the past now."
00:21:05.970,00:21:06.960,这静白明里暗里,,,
00:21:07.340,00:21:08.170,给了你们这么多活,00:21:06.400,00:21:09.440,"Besides our usual chores, Prioress Jingbai
has given us so much extra work."
00:21:08.970,00:21:10.590,我不能眼睁睁地看着你们辛苦,,,
00:21:11.020,00:21:12.000,自己坐享其成,00:21:09.729,00:21:13.106,I can't sit idly by and enjoy the fruits of your work.
00:21:13.310,00:21:15.350,娘子动不得,00:21:14.029,00:21:16.668,"Mistress, don't touch that."
00:21:16.020,00:21:17.260,娘子既然这样说了,,,
00:21:17.730,00:21:18.810,我们也不能说什么,00:21:16.859,00:21:20.000,"There is not much we can say
if you put it that way."
00:21:19.520,00:21:20.310,可是只一样,,,
00:21:20.980,00:21:22.600,娘子现在身子还没有好全,00:21:20.160,00:21:21.429,But there is one thing.
00:21:22.900,00:21:25.440,还是很虚弱要能走动呢,00:21:21.600,00:21:25.000,You're still frail and have not fully recovered yet.
00:21:25.700,00:21:27.610,就去捡些小的柴火来,00:21:25.181,00:21:28.368,"If you have the strength, you can go gather kindling."
00:21:27.870,00:21:29.650,像砍柴呀 烧炭这样的脏活,,,
00:21:30.240,00:21:31.950,还是我跟浣碧姑娘来做吧,00:21:28.528,00:21:33.364,"Jade and I should do the dirty work
of chopping firewood and burning charcoal."
00:21:34.750,00:21:35.360,好,00:21:35.360,00:21:36.200,All right.

00:22:18.960,00:22:20.790,要不然都像莞嫔那样,00:22:19.799,00:22:21.640,They would hurt His Majesty's feelings
00:22:21.130,00:22:22.410,会让皇上伤心的,00:22:21.640,00:22:23.648,if they behaved like Concubine Sourire.

00:22:55.950,00:22:58.700,她不是应该服侍皇上左右的吗,00:22:56.600,00:22:59.716,Isn't she supposed to be serving His Majesty?
00:22:59.290,00:23:01.200,芳若是莞嫔的教引姑姑,00:23:00.000,00:23:02.538,Orchid was Concubine Sourire’s etiquette instructor.

to pray for blessings."
00:23:25.020,00:23:26.310,皇后怎么打算,00:23:25.848,00:23:27.120,What do you plan to do?
00:23:26.610,00:23:28.650,宫中一向在宝华殿祈福,00:23:27.120,00:23:29.761,We always pray for blessings in Baohua Hall.
00:23:29.150,00:23:30.810,臣妾想等到开春,00:23:30.000,00:23:32.073,"However, it may be better to wait for spring"
00:23:31.360,00:23:32.650,去甘露寺也好,00:23:32.251,00:23:34.118,and go to the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:23:33.780,00:23:36.740,一则省了请僧尼入宫的银子,00:23:34.702,00:23:37.937,"This will save the cost of inviting
monks and nuns into the palace,"
00:23:37.750,00:23:39.860,二来臣妾也可以,,,
00:23:40.160,00:23:43.080,带着各宫嫔妃出宫更显诚意,00:23:38.320,00:23:44.021,"and bringing the concubines with me
 will show deep sincerity."
00:23:43.580,00:23:44.700,你执意要去吗,00:23:44.200,00:23:46.066,Do you insist on going there?
00:23:46.050,00:23:47.540,臣妾听皇额娘盼咐,00:23:46.520,00:23:48.800,"I will obey your wish, Imperial Mother."
00:23:50.800,00:23:53.420,也罢你自己懂得分寸,00:23:51.364,00:23:52.516,All right then.
00:23:53.840,00:23:54.630,就这么办吧,00:23:52.738,00:23:54.163,You know what is proper.
,,,00:23:54.385,00:23:55.956,We will do as you suggest.
00:24:05.810,00:24:06.430,站住,00:24:06.600,00:24:07.634,Stop!
00:24:07.610,00:24:08.350,静白师父,00:24:08.350,00:24:09.400,Prioress Jingbai.
00:24:10.900,00:24:13.190,你挑的这些柴火哪里是能用的,00:24:11.520,00:24:14.244,How is the firewood you picked even usable?
00:24:15.030,00:24:17.690,这些柴火必定是后坡的吧,00:24:15.782,00:24:19.000,You must have found it on the rear of the mountain.
00:24:18.830,00:24:19.910,只看着高大,,,
00:24:20.250,00:24:21.490,但水分多最不好烧,00:24:19.600,00:24:23.200,The branches are big but are too moist to burn well.
00:24:22.960,00:24:24.820,原看你一副聪明面孔,00:24:23.788,00:24:25.920,You originally seemed intelligent...
00:24:25.500,00:24:28.460,谁知道却是一副笨肚肠,00:24:26.212,00:24:26.712,who would know you are stupid to the bone?
00:24:30.670,00:24:32.880,到底是宫里头出来的娘娘,00:24:31.460,00:24:33.720,"After all, you were a concubine in the palace,"
00:24:33.590,00:24:35.750,五谷不分四体不勤,00:24:34.422,00:24:36.760,and have no common sense or ability to work.
00:24:36.390,00:24:37.670,是享福的命,00:24:37.142,00:24:38.845,All you did was enjoy a comfortable life.
00:24:39.390,00:24:40.550,师父说得对呀,00:24:40.188,00:24:41.724,My Prioress is right.
00:24:41.140,00:24:43.880,你看她那狐媚样哪里会拾柴火,00:24:41.987,00:24:44.707,"Look at this minx. How could she know
how to gather firewood?"
00:24:44.230,00:24:46.810,只会一味矫情哄人可怜罢了,00:24:44.896,00:24:47.880,"All she knows is how to feign her feelings
and make people pity her."
00:24:47.230,00:24:48.690,她还以为她在宫里呢,00:24:47.964,00:24:50.000,She still thinks she’s in the palace.
00:24:49.230,00:24:50.190,想必在宫里,,,
00:24:50.530,00:24:53.110,也是一味狐媚皇上的狐狸精罢了,00:24:50.000,00:24:54.163,"I bet she was a minx in the palace
who spent all her time bewitching His Majesty."
00:24:54.070,00:24:56.980,阿弥陀佛去吧去吧,00:24:54.800,00:24:56.910,Amitabha Buddha.
00:24:58.240,00:24:59.480,我瞧了就心烦,00:24:56.910,00:24:58.228,"Go, leave."
,,,00:24:58.920,00:25:00.805,I’m irritated just by looking at you.
00:25:03.540,00:25:05.000,再去拾两担柴火回来,00:25:04.368,00:25:06.080,Go gather two more baskets of firewood.
00:25:05.460,00:25:06.790,要不不许吃饭,00:25:06.242,00:25:08.097,"Otherwise, no dinner for you."
00:25:13.130,00:25:14.370,要吃饭了你要干什么去,00:25:13.494,00:25:15.731,Dinner is about to start. Where are you going?
00:25:17.720,00:25:19.840,柴火不够我再去捡些来,00:25:18.548,00:25:20.960,There is not enough firewood. I’m going to gather more.
00:25:20.220,00:25:21.380,也不能饿着肚子去啊,00:25:20.969,00:25:22.280,You can’t go on an empty stomach.
00:25:21.720,00:25:22.430,吃完饭再去,00:25:22.280,00:25:23.720,Go after dinner.
00:25:23.100,00:25:24.640,不了早去早回,00:25:23.810,00:25:25.800,"Better not. The earlier I go, the earlier I will return."
00:25:25.060,00:25:26.770,你身子不好我陪你去吧,00:25:25.826,00:25:27.800,You’re not in good health. Let me go with you.
00:25:27.400,00:25:30.510,怎么了她又掐你了是吧,00:25:28.000,00:25:29.343,What’s wrong?
,,,00:25:30.171,00:25:32.000,"She pinched you again, didn’t she?"
00:25:31.820,00:25:34.100,别人羞辱你你就不知道还手吗,00:25:32.535,00:25:35.600,Don’t you know to fight back when being bullied?
00:25:34.950,00:25:36.030,原是我自己不好,00:25:35.600,00:25:36.950,It’s my fault.
00:25:37.030,00:25:38.240,擦些药酒就好了,00:25:37.928,00:25:39.680,I’ll just rub some liniment on it.
00:25:38.820,00:25:40.440,你就不知道告诉住持啊,00:25:39.680,00:25:41.455,Don’t you know you can tell the Abbess?
00:25:41.450,00:25:44.620,多一事不如少一事吧别说了,00:25:42.020,00:25:44.470,"The less trouble, the better."
,,,00:25:44.920,00:25:46.400,Please speak no more of it.
00:25:56.760,00:25:58.040,皇后娘娘金安,00:25:57.512,00:25:59.169,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:25:58.640,00:26:01.250,这么晚了你们还过来干吗呀,00:25:59.460,00:26:02.182,Why have you come so late in the evening?
00:26:03.810,00:26:04.590,起来吧,,,
00:26:05.140,00:26:06.130,谢皇后娘娘,00:26:04.640,00:26:05.558,You may rise.
00:26:06.310,00:26:07.020,赐座,00:26:06.000,00:26:06.920,"Thank you, Your Majesty."
00:26:13.820,00:26:14.980,听说娘娘最近,00:26:06.920,00:26:08.126,Have a seat.
00:26:15.280,00:26:17.060,为去甘露寺祈福之事忙碌,00:26:14.347,00:26:18.120,"I heard that Your Majesty has been busy preparing
for the trip to the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:26:17.450,00:26:18.310,臣妾特地过来看看,,,
00:26:18.660,00:26:20.320,有什么能帮得上娘娘的忙,00:26:18.120,00:26:21.280,"I came to see if there is anything
I can help Your Majesty with."
00:26:20.740,00:26:21.730,你放心不下,,,
00:26:22.080,00:26:24.110,本宫把祈福礼放在甘露寺,00:26:21.360,00:26:25.276,"You’re worried because I chose to hold
the ceremony in the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:26:25.580,00:26:28.040,皇后娘娘圣断 臣妾愚钝,00:26:26.370,00:26:28.800,"Your Majesty has keen judgment.
 Dull-witted as I am,"
00:26:28.370,00:26:30.080,的确心存疑惑,00:26:28.920,00:26:31.400,"I am, indeed, perplexed by it."
00:26:31.590,00:26:32.790,本宫这样做,,,
00:26:33.170,00:26:35.290,是因为知道皇上心里头,00:26:32.400,00:26:38.080,"I’m doing this because I know that
His Majesty still has feelings for Zhen Huan."
00:26:35.800,00:26:37.210,还放不下甄嬛,,,
00:26:38.130,00:26:39.590,甄嬛已经被逐出宫,00:26:38.770,00:26:40.493,Zhen Huan has already been banished from the palace.
00:26:39.930,00:26:41.170,她家人流放育古塔,00:26:40.493,00:26:42.090,And her family is exiled to Ningguta.
00:26:41.640,00:26:42.590,还有什么不妥吗,00:26:42.090,00:26:43.687,What's there to worry about?
00:26:43.010,00:26:45.000,皇上如此在意胧月公主,,,
00:26:45.310,00:26:46.590,让人格外警醒,00:26:43.687,00:26:47.854,"It's alarming how much His Majesty
cares about Princess Longyue."
00:26:47.810,00:26:48.930,如今连芳若,,,
00:26:49.270,00:26:50.850,也都被赶出了养心殿,00:26:48.487,00:26:51.527,"Even Orchid has been cast out
from the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:26:51.690,00:26:53.800,皇上身边没有人伺候了,00:26:52.480,00:26:54.720,There is no longer a maid directly serving His Majesty.
00:26:54.110,00:26:55.970,区区一个宫女算不上大事,00:26:54.720,00:26:56.796,She is only a maid. It's not a big deal.
00:26:56.280,00:26:58.480,芳若乃是甄娱的教引姑姑,00:26:56.920,00:26:59.291,Madam Orchid was Zhen Huan's etiquette instructor.
00:26:59.450,00:27:00.810,皇上由此及彼,,,
00:27:01.160,00:27:02.190,正是因为放不下,00:27:00.160,00:27:03.090,His Majesty did so because he still cares.
00:27:02.530,00:27:05.120,所以才不愿意芳若在眼前,00:27:03.176,00:27:06.089,He doesn't want to be reminded of Zhen Huan by Orchid.
00:27:05.790,00:27:07.400,你看惠贵人便知了,00:27:06.595,00:27:08.319,Just take a look at Lady Vertu.
00:27:07.660,00:27:11.120,甄娱离宫后 皇上几乎就未见她,00:27:08.360,00:27:11.989,"His Majesty has rarely seen her
since Zhen Huan left the palace."
00:27:11.710,00:27:14.870,就连到咸福宫去看看敬妃,00:27:12.400,00:27:15.720,"Even when His Majesty visits Consort Estime,"
00:27:15.250,00:27:16.490,也不愿多走一步,,,
00:27:16.840,00:27:18.420,到旁边的存菊堂啊,00:27:15.720,00:27:19.200,"he won't set foot in Vertu's palace, right next door."
00:27:18.800,00:27:20.920,好在甄家在京中已无亲眷,00:27:19.560,00:27:22.200,"Fortunately, the Zhen family has no relatives in Beijing anymore."
00:27:21.510,00:27:22.840,甄嬛孤苦无依,00:27:22.240,00:27:23.760,"Zhen Huan has no one to rely on,"
00:27:23.180,00:27:24.960,想必已不能翻身了,00:27:23.889,00:27:25.880,and won't be able to turn the situation around again.
00:27:25.220,00:27:28.260,话虽如此 但本宫还是不放心,00:27:25.977,00:27:29.175,"Be that as it may, I am still not at ease."
00:27:29.100,00:27:30.390,甄远道命大,,,
00:27:30.690,00:27:32.100,他已经到了甯古塔,00:27:30.000,00:27:32.951,"Zhen Yuandao is lucky to have survived
 the journey to Ningguta."
00:27:32.520,00:27:33.930,咱们鞭长莫及,00:27:33.000,00:27:34.983,He is out of our reach now.
00:27:34.650,00:27:37.440,倒不如把近眼前的人,00:27:35.360,00:27:38.680,"We might as well focus on the person right under our noses,"
00:27:37.990,00:27:39.690,好好地踩踩实,00:27:38.680,00:27:40.880,and ensure the soil is pounded down over her.
00:27:40.200,00:27:41.560,皇后娘娘高瞻远瞩,,,
00:27:41.950,00:27:43.110,我等望尘莫及,00:27:40.960,00:27:43.993,"Your Majesty has great foresight.
We feel incomparably inferior."
00:27:46.370,00:27:47.150,剪秋,00:27:47.200,00:27:48.080,Autumn.
00:27:47.450,00:27:49.280,把本宫那串红玉珠链拿来,00:27:48.080,00:27:50.163,Fetch me the Red Jade necklace.
00:27:49.450,00:27:50.070,是,00:27:50.199,00:27:50.819,Yes.
00:27:52.500,00:27:53.280,娘娘,00:27:53.337,00:27:54.117,Your Majesty.
00:27:55.340,00:27:57.950,这个是外国进贡的红玉珠链,00:27:56.216,00:27:58.900,This is a tributary Red Jade necklace.
00:27:58.760,00:28:02.210,本宫瞧着它颜色年轻喜兴,00:27:59.627,00:28:03.122,The color looks young and vibrant.
00:28:02.930,00:28:04.590,自己带怕是艳了,00:28:03.640,00:28:05.300,"It might be too bold for me,"
00:28:05.930,00:28:09.010,倒是给祺嫔很适合,00:28:06.630,00:28:09.745,but it suits Concubine Délice very well.
00:28:11.940,00:28:12.970,谢谢皇后娘娘,00:28:12.720,00:28:14.008,I thank Your Majesty.
00:28:21.860,00:28:23.690,这红玉珠真是好香啊,00:28:22.570,00:28:24.400,The Red Jade smells so good.
00:28:24.240,00:28:26.450,想必是上好的奇香呢,00:28:24.920,00:28:27.560,It must be scented with the finest fragrances.
00:28:26.990,00:28:29.780,不好的东西本宫怎么会给你们,00:28:27.640,00:28:30.700,I would never give you anything less.
00:28:38.840,00:28:39.830,嬛儿离京后,00:28:39.600,00:28:40.920,"Ever since Huan'er left,"
00:28:41.170,00:28:42.580,贵人一直郁郁寡欢,00:28:41.800,00:28:43.920,"you have been in low spirits, My Lady."
00:28:44.220,00:28:45.460,一别三个月,00:28:45.048,00:28:46.520,It has been three months.
00:28:46.090,00:28:48.680,我很挂念娱儿在宫外的境况,00:28:46.942,00:28:49.600,I am concerned for her situation out there.
00:28:49.350,00:28:51.630,若是可以微臣也愿意,,,
00:28:51.930,00:28:52.970,替贵人走这一遭,00:28:50.226,00:28:54.240,"If it's possible, I am willing to make a visit on your behalf."
00:28:53.980,00:28:56.840,可是甘露寺乃群尼居住之所,00:28:54.872,00:28:57.732,"However, the Temple of Pure Dew is a place for nuns."
00:28:57.520,00:28:59.180,微臣想去而不能啊,00:28:58.000,00:29:00.360,It would be inappropriate for me to go.
00:28:59.780,00:29:01.190,若是旁人问起来,00:29:00.560,00:29:02.128,"If anyone asks,"
00:29:01.650,00:29:03.310,便说是我嘱咐你去的,00:29:02.502,00:29:04.208,just say I sent you there.
00:29:04.660,00:29:06.690,我是走不出这紫禁城了,00:29:05.456,00:29:07.486,I can't leave the Forbidden City.
00:29:07.370,00:29:10.070,希望你能去多看看她,00:29:08.286,00:29:10.986,I hope you can go visit her often.
00:29:10.870,00:29:11.700,微臣领命,00:29:11.738,00:29:12.720,I'm honored to obey.
00:29:12.500,00:29:15.580,当然你也要懂得避嫌,00:29:13.353,00:29:16.433,"Of course, you need to be discreet."
00:29:16.330,00:29:17.910,不要逗留太久,00:29:17.198,00:29:19.000,Do not linger there too long.
00:29:18.840,00:29:19.450,是,00:29:19.756,00:29:20.366,Yes.
00:29:39.360,00:29:40.850,小姐的冻疮又复发了,00:29:40.000,00:29:42.000,"My Lady, your frostbite is flaring up again."
00:29:41.320,00:29:42.850,今年好像肿得更加厉害了,00:29:42.000,00:29:43.789,It looks worse this year.
00:29:44.650,00:29:47.320,果然有些事一心想忘也忘不了,00:29:45.360,00:29:48.296,"Some things just can't be forgotten
no matter how hard I try."
00:29:48.320,00:29:50.780,就如这冻疮年年都复发,00:29:49.180,00:29:52.120,Just like the frostbite. It comes back every year.
00:29:55.750,00:29:57.080,这双手长满了冻疮,00:29:56.400,00:29:58.240,My hands are blistered with frostbite.
00:29:57.920,00:29:59.620,红的青的紫的,00:29:58.720,00:30:00.552,"Red, green, and purple."
00:30:00.090,00:30:02.670,小姐你看这红的是珊瑚,00:30:00.720,00:30:03.720,"Look, My Lady, the red is coral,"
00:30:03.170,00:30:04.630,青的是绿玉翡翠,00:30:03.960,00:30:05.506,"the green is jade,"
00:30:05.170,00:30:06.910,这紫的就是紫瑛石,00:30:05.880,00:30:07.880,and the purple is amethyst.
00:30:08.180,00:30:09.460,奴婢刚入宫的时候,,,
00:30:09.720,00:30:11.460,只是一个做洒扫上的小宫女,00:30:08.880,00:30:12.403,"I was a maid doing menial chores
when I first entered the palace."
00:30:11.930,00:30:14.640,也是新进宫嘛难免受欺负,00:30:12.560,00:30:15.493,It's hard to avoid being bullied as a newcomer.
00:30:15.140,00:30:16.760,冬天给姑姑们洗衣裳,00:30:15.800,00:30:17.880,"I washed clothes for the Madams in the winter,"
00:30:17.310,00:30:18.680,冻得一手都是冻疮,00:30:17.920,00:30:19.603,and got frostbite all over my hands.
00:30:21.270,00:30:24.140,那时候纯元皇后,00:30:22.000,00:30:26.800,"When His Majesty was still a lord,
he was already married to Empress Première."
00:30:24.530,00:30:25.640,还只是雍亲王福晋呢,,,
00:30:26.320,00:30:27.730,进宫给太后请安,00:30:27.120,00:30:28.760,"One time, when she visited the Empress Dowager,"
00:30:28.360,00:30:31.530,看见了奴婢的手说真可怜,00:30:29.000,00:30:32.240,"she saw my hands and said, ""Poor thing."""
00:30:32.030,00:30:33.020,手都冻成这样了,,,
00:30:33.410,00:30:34.570,怎么还在洗衣裳呢,00:30:32.866,00:30:35.720,"""Why are you still washing clothes with
such bad frostbite?"""
00:30:35.290,00:30:37.570,后来这内务府,,,
00:30:37.960,00:30:39.990,才把奴婢调去干别的活,00:30:36.000,00:30:40.700,"After that, the Household Department
assigned me to other tasks."
00:30:41.670,00:30:43.910,好在那个时候有做粗活的底子,00:30:42.280,00:30:44.880,"Luckily, I'm experienced in manual labor from that time."
00:30:44.550,00:30:45.330,要不然现在,,,
00:30:45.920,00:30:47.290,还真伺候不了娘子呢,00:30:45.426,00:30:48.191,"Otherwise, I would not be able to serve you now."
00:30:48.010,00:30:48.710,我来帮你吧,00:30:48.854,00:30:49.791,Let me help you.
00:30:51.720,00:30:51.960,可使不得,,,
00:30:52.140,00:30:52.970,嬛妹妹,00:30:52.603,00:30:53.611,"- Please don't.
- Huan'er."
00:30:55.020,00:30:55.720,温大人,00:30:55.849,00:30:56.549,Dr. Wen.
00:30:57.020,00:30:58.510,你怎么能干这么粗重的活呢,00:30:57.880,00:30:59.620,How can you do such strenuous work?
00:30:59.440,00:31:00.890,我只是一个修行之人,00:31:00.120,00:31:01.880,I'm just a commoner practicing Buddhism.
00:31:01.440,00:31:02.470,有什么不能干呢,00:31:02.180,00:31:03.920,There's nothing wrong with me working.
00:31:10.280,00:31:11.020,够了够了,00:31:10.720,00:31:11.920,Enough. Enough.
00:31:11.700,00:31:13.030,今日用的水已经够了,00:31:12.560,00:31:14.000,The water is enough for today.
00:31:13.580,00:31:15.740,今日的水难不成你每日,00:31:14.240,00:31:15.640,For today?
00:31:16.120,00:31:16.980,都要这么辛苦吗,00:31:15.800,00:31:18.200,You have to work this hard every day?
00:31:18.290,00:31:20.530,所有事情亲力亲为,00:31:18.920,00:31:21.960,We do everything ourselves.
00:31:21.380,00:31:23.620,这算什么小姐和我们,00:31:22.120,00:31:23.480,This is nothing.
00:31:23.920,00:31:25.960,每天都要自己亲自砍柴烧水,00:31:23.640,00:31:28.500,"My Lady has helped chop firewood, boil water,
wash clothes, and cook meals every day."
00:31:26.380,00:31:27.370,洗衣煮饭的,,,
00:31:27.960,00:31:29.330,我和槿汐倒没什么,00:31:28.740,00:31:30.320,"It's not hard for Jinxi and me,"
00:31:29.800,00:31:30.790,本是应该做的,00:31:30.560,00:31:31.520,since these are our duties.
00:31:31.590,00:31:34.300,只是可怜了小姐的手,00:31:32.360,00:31:35.240,"However, My Lady's hands have suffered."
00:31:37.100,00:31:37.800,没什么,00:31:37.960,00:31:38.800,It's nothing.
00:31:38.180,00:31:39.510,给我看看给我看看,00:31:39.020,00:31:40.680,Let me see. Let me see.
00:31:48.240,00:31:50.600,温大人我来吧,00:31:49.139,00:31:51.680,"Dr. Wen, please allow me."
00:32:02.790,00:32:04.000,来 敷一下,00:32:03.320,00:32:05.080,Here. Cover the wounds.
00:32:04.840,00:32:08.000,我来吧我来,00:32:05.180,00:32:08.980,Let me do this. Let me.
00:32:08.630,00:32:11.670,我出宫这些日子 眉姐姐好吗,00:32:09.160,00:32:12.840,How has Meizhuang been since I left the palace?
00:32:12.510,00:32:13.250,胧月好吗,00:32:13.320,00:32:14.400,How's Longyue?
00:32:14.720,00:32:15.670,你答应过我的,00:32:15.600,00:32:16.800,You promised me that
00:32:16.350,00:32:17.680,会为我照顾她们的,00:32:17.200,00:32:18.720,you would look after them for me.
00:32:19.810,00:32:21.260,贵人和公主一切都好,00:32:20.620,00:32:22.220,They are both doing well.
00:32:22.060,00:32:23.100,贵人放心不下你,00:32:22.820,00:32:23.980,Lady Vertu is worried about you
00:32:23.440,00:32:24.270,让我设法来看你,00:32:23.980,00:32:25.400,and asked me to visit you.
00:32:25.730,00:32:27.640,她们好我就放心了,00:32:26.520,00:32:29.000,I am relieved to know they are doing well.
00:32:28.900,00:32:30.060,我也没有别的本事,00:32:29.720,00:32:31.040,I don't have other skills.
00:32:30.820,00:32:31.850,你让我照顾谁,,,
00:32:32.570,00:32:33.980,我便拼命去照顾就是了,00:32:31.600,00:32:35.200,But I try my best to look after those you put into my care.
00:32:35.160,00:32:35.740,多谢,00:32:36.080,00:32:36.800,I thank you.
00:32:36.450,00:32:37.410,你我不必言谢,00:32:37.240,00:32:38.400,You need not thank me.
00:32:38.540,00:32:40.280,今日的药也就这些了,00:32:39.300,00:32:41.400,That's all the medicine I brought today.
00:32:40.950,00:32:41.990,你先将就着用着,00:32:41.740,00:32:43.200,You can make do with it for now.
00:32:42.660,00:32:44.950,改日我会再送一些好的来,00:32:43.520,00:32:46.200,I will bring you better medicine the next time.
00:32:46.500,00:32:47.210,多谢,00:32:47.340,00:32:48.200,Thank you.
00:32:53.880,00:32:54.960,手脚都利索点,00:32:54.700,00:32:55.780,Don't dawdle!
00:32:56.140,00:32:57.750,快点把殿里和寺外,,,
00:32:58.050,00:32:58.790,都打扫干净了,00:32:56.680,00:32:59.880,Be quick. Clean up the temple inside and out.
00:33:07.400,00:33:08.930,这个时辰才砍柴回来,00:33:08.300,00:33:09.840,What took you so long?
00:33:09.400,00:33:10.390,一味偷懒去了吧,00:33:10.080,00:33:11.520,You must be loafing around.
00:33:12.570,00:33:13.480,把桶拿过来,00:33:13.400,00:33:14.440,Bring over the barrel.
00:33:18.330,00:33:20.820,去把大殿的地擦干净去,00:33:19.040,00:33:21.760,Go clean the floor of the main hall.
00:33:28.000,00:33:29.960,擦地这活儿最折磨人了,00:33:28.540,00:33:30.800,Mopping the floor is the greatest torment.
00:33:30.630,00:33:33.090,月要不能直头也不能抬,00:33:31.380,00:33:34.200,You can't straighten your back or raise your head.
00:33:33.630,00:33:34.960,这大殿地方又大,00:33:34.300,00:33:36.040,"Besides, the main hall is quite large."
00:33:35.300,00:33:36.420,几个时辰下来呀,00:33:36.080,00:33:37.200,"After a few hours,"
00:33:36.890,00:33:38.920,身子骨都跟散了架似的,00:33:37.560,00:33:39.700,your whole body will be aching.
00:33:39.970,00:33:42.460,到底是静白最会调弄人,00:33:40.480,00:33:43.340,"Jingbai knows well how to discipline
 people with such work."
00:33:43.850,00:33:44.810,听说过几天,00:33:43.920,00:33:45.660,I heard that in a few days
00:33:45.020,00:33:47.100,要为宫中的公主和皇子祈福,00:33:45.800,00:33:48.320,"there will be a ceremony praying for the
imperial princesses and princes."
00:33:47.650,00:33:49.600,莫愁好像也生过一个公主,00:33:48.320,00:33:50.240,Mochou gave birth to a princess.
00:33:49.940,00:33:51.150,祈福没她的份儿,00:33:50.380,00:33:52.160,Will she participate in the ceremony as well?
00:33:51.860,00:33:54.140,她呀是个废默的贱人,00:33:52.600,00:33:55.166,"She is a banished wretch, inferior to us."
00:33:54.490,00:33:56.570,连咱们都不如还配去祈福,00:33:55.386,00:33:57.800,How could she deserve to pray?
00:33:57.280,00:33:57.940,就是,00:33:57.960,00:33:59.200,That's right.
00:34:20.760,00:34:22.420,槿汐我没事,00:34:21.120,00:34:23.440,"Jinxi, I'm fine."
00:34:23.220,00:34:23.880,是我,00:34:24.020,00:34:24.800,It's me.
00:34:30.110,00:34:30.840,果郡王,00:34:30.880,00:34:31.700,Noble Prince Guo.
00:34:31.900,00:34:32.600,我来迟了,00:34:32.480,00:34:33.640,I came too late.
00:34:35.690,00:34:36.680,你何时回来的,00:34:36.520,00:34:37.800,When did you come back?
00:34:37.110,00:34:39.150,三日前皇兄召我回京,00:34:38.000,00:34:40.280,Three days ago. His Majesty summoned me back.
00:34:40.660,00:34:41.740,此处说话不方便,00:34:41.360,00:34:42.720,This is not a good place to chat.
00:34:42.240,00:34:43.070,我们借一步说话,00:34:43.080,00:34:44.400,May I speak to you privately?
00:34:54.670,00:34:56.130,一直未曾能当面谢你,,,
00:34:56.670,00:34:57.660,心里过意不去,00:34:55.200,00:34:59.200,"I feel guilty for not having expressed my
gratitude to you in person."
00:34:59.680,00:35:01.090,我只是做了分内的事情,00:35:00.240,00:35:02.100,"I was just doing the right thing,"
00:35:01.720,00:35:04.180,却还帮不上什么 已经感愧,00:35:02.400,00:35:05.800,and I'm ashamed for not being able to make a difference.
00:35:05.890,00:35:07.380,你若再说谢不谢的话,00:35:06.580,00:35:08.400,I will be even more embarrassed
00:35:08.060,00:35:09.170,我就更加过意不去了,00:35:08.800,00:35:10.600,if you insist on thanking me.
00:35:10.900,00:35:13.180,我因为不曾主动害人而到此地步,00:35:11.620,00:35:14.360,"I never wished to harm anyone
yet I was banished."
00:35:13.980,00:35:15.470,你却因帮我甄家上书,,,
00:35:16.110,00:35:17.100,而被赶去盛京,00:35:14.700,00:35:18.060,"You spoke up for my family
and were sent away to Shengjing."
00:35:18.150,00:35:18.940,这几个月,,,
00:35:19.860,00:35:21.270,到底是我们连累了你,00:35:19.020,00:35:22.120,We caused you such trouble in the past few months.
00:35:21.490,00:35:23.570,别这么说 我如今回京,00:35:22.240,00:35:23.560,Don't say that.
00:35:23.990,00:35:25.200,皇兄待我依旧如初,00:35:23.660,00:35:26.400,"His Majesty treats me the same as before,"
00:35:25.790,00:35:27.950,我也依旧是果郡王 没有分别,00:35:26.540,00:35:29.000,and I still hold my rank. Nothing is different.
00:35:29.210,00:35:30.190,你不必放在心上,00:35:30.060,00:35:31.360,Don't be concerned for me.
00:35:33.500,00:35:34.580,我这次去盛京,,,
00:35:35.000,00:35:36.330,就像当年去蜀中一样,00:35:34.480,00:35:36.060,"I went to Shengjing for leisure,"
00:35:36.920,00:35:37.830,只是邂玩而已,00:35:36.060,00:35:39.120,"just like when I traveled around
 central Sichuan previously."
00:35:38.590,00:35:41.080,不过是借个思过的名头罢了,00:35:39.200,00:35:41.900,"To ""reflect on my fault"" was only an excuse,"
00:35:41.840,00:35:42.550,唬人的,00:35:42.660,00:35:43.719,not real.
00:35:43.180,00:35:44.790,你总是因为我甄家的缘故,00:35:43.920,00:35:45.840,"Still, you were implicated by my family..."
00:35:46.060,00:35:47.010,你要再这么说下去,00:35:46.560,00:35:48.000,"If you continue saying so,"
00:35:47.810,00:35:49.300,我便不敢说出我今日的来意了,00:35:48.140,00:35:50.800,I won't dare tell you why I came here today.
00:35:51.190,00:35:51.970,王爷请说,00:35:52.020,00:35:53.400,"Please go ahead, Your Lordship."
00:35:53.520,00:35:54.730,两日前我进宫,00:35:54.300,00:35:56.000,I went into the palace two days ago
00:35:55.320,00:35:56.350,突然见到了一个人,00:35:56.180,00:35:57.560,and saw someone by accident.
00:35:56.860,00:35:58.560,因此就画了一幅像回来,00:35:57.600,00:35:59.520,So I painted a portrait and brought it here.
00:35:59.320,00:36:01.780,请娘子点评一下指教一下笔法,00:36:00.140,00:36:03.000,"I wonder if you can comment on
my techniques and offer some advice."
00:36:03.030,00:36:04.360,我并不擅长丹青,00:36:03.920,00:36:05.460,"I'm not good at ""red and green painting."""
00:36:04.820,00:36:06.360,何来指教王爷笔法呢,00:36:05.620,00:36:08.200,"How would I be able to critique
Your Lordship's techniques?"
00:36:12.170,00:36:17.290,这是敬妃这是眉姐姐,00:36:12.940,00:36:15.080,This is Consort Estime.
,,,00:36:17.120,00:36:18.360,This is Meizhuang.
00:36:21.420,00:36:22.330,这是,00:36:22.080,00:36:23.240,This is...
00:36:23.590,00:36:25.000,我初次见到胧月公主,,,
00:36:25.600,00:36:26.460,便画了这幅像,00:36:24.220,00:36:27.920,"I painted this portrait the first time
I met Princess Longyue"
00:36:27.350,00:36:28.800,略表我做皇叔的心意嘛,00:36:28.000,00:36:30.080,to show my affection for her as my niece.
00:36:32.520,00:36:33.760,才这么些时候,00:36:33.160,00:36:34.800,She has grown so much
00:36:35.810,00:36:37.220,胧月都已经长这么大了,00:36:36.160,00:36:38.000,in such a short time.
00:36:39.070,00:36:40.400,孩子总是长得格外的快,00:36:39.800,00:36:41.640,Children always grow particularly fast.
00:36:41.570,00:36:42.680,听闻再过些日子,00:36:42.380,00:36:43.800,I heard that Princess Longyue
00:36:43.240,00:36:44.600,胧月公主就满周岁了,00:36:44.000,00:36:46.200,will celebrate her first birthday soon.
00:36:45.490,00:36:47.450,我想娘子是胧月公主的生母,00:36:46.280,00:36:48.680,"I assume you must want to know
how she is doing"
00:36:48.030,00:36:49.770,自然想知道自己孩子的情况,00:36:48.680,00:36:50.900,as you are her birth mother.
00:36:55.380,00:36:58.870,王爷此画胜过旁人千言万语,00:36:56.020,00:36:59.520,This painting is better than thousands of words.
00:36:59.920,00:37:01.250,在此谢过王爷厚意,00:37:00.760,00:37:02.360,I thank Your Lordship.
00:37:02.720,00:37:04.050,我十分喜爱胧月公主,00:37:03.500,00:37:05.200,"I adore Princess Longyue,"
00:37:04.880,00:37:06.170,拙笔还能画上几笔,00:37:05.480,00:37:07.400,and my humble painting is passable.
00:37:07.010,00:37:08.000,以后不若这样,,,
00:37:08.470,00:37:10.260,我每隔俩月便画上一幅过来,00:37:07.680,00:37:11.280,"How about this?
I will paint a portrait of her  every few months"
00:37:10.810,00:37:11.760,请娘子品评,00:37:11.280,00:37:13.140,and bring it for you to comment on.
00:37:12.310,00:37:13.760,不知娘子意下如何,00:37:13.140,00:37:14.480,What do you think?
00:37:14.060,00:37:14.850,多谢,00:37:14.660,00:37:15.380,Thank you.
00:37:20.230,00:37:21.560,前面就是飘渺峰,00:37:21.020,00:37:22.760,"In front of us is Misty Mountain,"
00:37:22.240,00:37:23.600,小王的清凉台就在那儿,00:37:22.920,00:37:24.540,where my Cooling Terrace is.
00:37:24.950,00:37:27.190,每个月我总会有十来日居住在那,00:37:25.800,00:37:28.220,I stay there for over ten days every month.
00:37:28.120,00:37:28.780,日后如果娘子,,,
00:37:29.080,00:37:30.060,有什么事情需要帮助,,,
00:37:30.740,00:37:32.150,派人过来通报一声就是,00:37:28.920,00:37:33.060,"If you need help in the future, just send someone there."
00:37:32.910,00:37:33.870,小王一定尽力,,,
00:37:35.670,00:37:37.160,能够见到胧月的画像,00:37:33.760,00:37:35.478,I will definitely try my best to help you.
00:37:37.750,00:37:40.290,我已感激不尽再无所求,00:37:36.400,00:37:39.822,I'm grateful for seeing a painting of Longyue.
,,,00:37:40.000,00:37:41.933,There is nothing else I want.
00:37:44.670,00:37:45.460,我这么说,,,
00:37:45.970,00:37:47.420,也是有事想请娘子相助,00:37:45.460,00:37:48.420,"Actually, I need your help with something."
00:37:48.720,00:37:50.090,胧月公主周岁之时,,,
00:37:50.560,00:37:51.590,宫中必有宴请,00:37:49.520,00:37:52.720,"There will certainly be a banquet
for Longyue's first birthday."
00:37:52.310,00:37:54.640,到时我还想娘子助我一臂之力,00:37:53.220,00:37:56.079,I would like to ask you to lend me a hand for that event.
00:37:58.770,00:38:01.060,身为皇叔我免不了,,,
00:38:01.440,00:38:03.400,要送一些衣衫裤袜作为贺礼,00:37:59.600,00:38:04.160,"As her uncle, I need to send her some clothes as gifts."
00:38:04.320,00:38:05.680,可惜郡王府的绣娘们,,,
00:38:06.280,00:38:10.490,手工并不好只好劳烦娘子了,00:38:05.160,00:38:08.520,But the seamstresses in my residence are not skilled enough.
,,,00:38:09.380,00:38:11.880,"So, my apologies, but I must trouble you for this."
00:38:19.080,00:38:19.870,真的吗,00:38:20.000,00:38:20.800,Really?
00:38:22.090,00:38:23.750,我真的可以亲手做给胧月吗,00:38:22.760,00:38:24.640,Can I really make clothes for Longyue?
00:38:24.170,00:38:25.080,你是她的母亲啊,00:38:24.760,00:38:26.100,You are her mother.
00:38:25.720,00:38:27.580,自然是你做的衣服最贴身,00:38:26.400,00:38:28.720,"The clothes you make will surely
be the most comfortable"
00:38:28.090,00:38:29.000,也是最合心的,00:38:28.720,00:38:30.160,and to her liking.
00:38:33.260,00:38:35.930,这张纸上是胧月的身量尺寸,00:38:34.020,00:38:36.700,Here are Longyue's measurements.
00:38:36.980,00:38:39.560,胧月生辰前五日我会亲自来取,,,
00:38:40.310,00:38:41.770,就在此处等候娘子,00:38:37.780,00:38:43.400,"Five days before her birthday I will be
 here to meet you and pick up the clothes."
00:38:46.530,00:38:49.900,日子还早 你慢慢做也来得及,00:38:47.160,00:38:51.020,It's still early so you don't have to rush.
00:38:54.950,00:38:59.290,胧月乖巧可爱 和你亲热得很,00:38:55.881,00:39:00.221,"Longyue is sweet and adorable
and seems very close to you."
00:39:00.420,00:39:01.120,可不是,00:39:01.220,00:39:02.160,Exactly.
00:39:01.540,00:39:03.250,听说胧月刚到这里的时候,,,
00:39:03.500,00:39:05.790,一直吃不饱奶敬妃为这事,00:39:02.386,00:39:05.205,"I heard that Longyue was always hungry
when she first came here."
00:39:06.090,00:39:07.300,还生气发落了乳母,00:39:05.738,00:39:08.720,Consort Estime was so angry that she punished the nursemaid.
00:39:08.010,00:39:09.540,后来虽有了新乳母,,,
00:39:09.930,00:39:11.290,可敬妃娘娘还是自己,00:39:08.922,00:39:10.760,"Even though Longyue had another nursemaid later,"
00:39:11.640,00:39:13.720,天天带着公主吃带着公主睡,00:39:10.760,00:39:14.280,"Her Highness insisted on personally
taking care of the princess day and night."
00:39:14.220,00:39:16.130,公主能不和敬妃亲吗,00:39:15.040,00:39:17.190,How could they not be close?
00:39:16.810,00:39:18.760,公主和皇上是最亲的,00:39:17.638,00:39:19.838,The princess is closest to Your Majesty.
00:39:19.020,00:39:21.600,皇上您看臣妾虽然抱着她,00:39:20.000,00:39:22.400,"Look, although she’s in my arms,"
00:39:21.980,00:39:22.840,可她这小眼珠子呀,,,
00:39:23.360,00:39:24.690,还一直盯着皇上呢,00:39:22.400,00:39:25.691,her little eyes are fixed on Your Majesty.
00:39:26.610,00:39:27.890,是在盯着朕看,00:39:27.433,00:39:29.200,"Yes, she is looking at me."
00:39:29.320,00:39:31.650,孩儿家长得都像极了父母双亲,00:39:30.160,00:39:32.676,Children always look like their parents.
00:39:32.160,00:39:34.490,公主看皇上就是看自己,00:39:32.920,00:39:35.880,"The princess looks at Your Majesty
as if she is looking in a mirror."
00:39:38.450,00:39:39.940,眉毛和鼻子像朕,00:39:39.236,00:39:41.006,She has my eyebrows and nose.
00:39:40.710,00:39:42.200,其他的都比朕好看,00:39:41.400,00:39:43.400,Her other features are prettier than mine.
00:39:42.670,00:39:45.660,是啊胧月公主这嘴巴和下巴,00:39:43.480,00:39:46.560,"Yes, Princess Longyue’s mouth and chin"
00:39:46.000,00:39:47.160,长得像极了莞嫔,00:39:46.560,00:39:47.960,look so much like Concubine Sourire.
00:39:47.510,00:39:48.620,简直是一模一样,00:39:47.960,00:39:49.480,They are almost identical.
00:39:49.510,00:39:50.420,你说像谁,00:39:50.200,00:39:51.330,Who did you say?
00:39:53.260,00:39:56.050,臣臣妾说公主长得像她额娘,00:39:54.080,00:39:57.204,I… I said the princess looks like her mother.
00:40:05.520,00:40:08.610,公主的额娘只有一个再无旁人,00:40:06.278,00:40:09.800,The princess only has one mother. Nobody else.
00:40:09.360,00:40:11.600,皇上息怒臣妾知错了,00:40:10.000,00:40:13.000,"May peace be restored in Your Majesty.
I recognize my fault."
00:40:14.820,00:40:16.440,臣妾绝不再失言了,00:40:15.560,00:40:17.520,I will never misspeak again.
00:41:03.670,00:41:06.750,恭迎皇后娘娘恭迎各位小主,00:41:04.436,00:41:07.796,Peace to Your Majesty and My Ladies.
00:41:11.170,00:41:11.960,都起来吧,,,

,,,00:41:13.154,00:41:14.254,Yes.
00:41:14.260,00:41:16.340,祈福之事安排得如何,00:41:15.058,00:41:17.378,How are the preparations for the ceremony going?
00:41:16.590,00:41:18.300,一切均已安排妥当,00:41:17.378,00:41:19.088,Everything is ready.
00:41:18.720,00:41:20.680,请娘娘入大殿敬香,00:41:19.506,00:41:21.865,"Please come offer incense in the main hall, Your Majesty."
00:41:21.310,00:41:22.760,有劳住持带路,00:41:22.165,00:41:23.800,"Please lead the way, Madam Abbess."

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
