00:02:25.760,00:02:27.350,奴才给莞贵人请安,00:02:26.420,00:02:29.860,I bow in respect before Lady Sourire.
00:02:29.600,00:02:30.870,什么了不得的东西,,,
00:02:31.120,00:02:32.110,要公公这样端着,00:02:30.820,00:02:33.480,"What is this, sir, that you have to carry personally?"
00:02:33.040,00:02:35.030,这是皇上特意赐予小主的,,,
00:02:35.480,00:02:36.710,小主一看便知,00:02:34.100,00:02:38.440,"His Majesty specially sends this to you, My Lady."
00:02:38.880,00:02:40.270,小主您瞧瞧,,,
00:02:40.840,00:02:41.990,这做鞋底的菜玉,00:02:39.900,00:02:41.760,"My Lady, have a look if you please."
00:02:42.360,00:02:44.990,属蓝田玉的名种 触手温润,00:02:41.900,00:02:47.900,"The sole is made of a famous variety of Lantian jade,
which feels soft and keeps your feet warm."
00:02:45.200,00:02:46.630,但穿着绝不凉脚心,,,
00:02:47.440,00:02:48.870,鞋里面全是镂空的,,,
00:02:49.240,00:02:50.590,里面装着各种香料,00:02:48.340,00:02:51.680,The shoes were hollowed and filled with assorted spices.
00:02:51.000,00:02:53.110,皇上说了 那叫步步生香,00:02:52.040,00:02:54.120,"His Majesty calls them ""fragrant steps""."
00:02:53.640,00:02:56.150,这鞋尖上缀着的是合浦明珠,00:02:54.760,00:02:57.380,The tips of the shoes are adorned with Hepu pearls.
00:02:56.600,00:02:58.710,虽然不能和咱们的东珠比尊贵,,,
00:02:58.960,00:03:01.310,但是圆润硕大光华灿烂,00:02:57.740,00:03:02.040,"Although not as valuable as eastern pearls,
they are perfectly sized and lustrous."
00:03:01.640,00:03:03.070,最难得的是这鞋面,,,
00:03:03.360,00:03:05.390,是用织金镂花的蜀锦做成,00:03:02.700,00:03:07.180,"The most notable part is the upper, made of
Shu [from Sichuan] Brocade with gold embroidery."
00:03:06.280,00:03:07.430,别的也就算了,,,
00:03:08.200,00:03:09.790,倒是这蜀锦难得,00:03:07.460,00:03:10.920,The Shu Brocade is a real rarity.
00:03:10.560,00:03:12.830,尤其是这织金镂花的蜀锦,00:03:11.620,00:03:14.280,Especially a piece with gold embroidery.
00:03:13.440,00:03:16.550,早说蜀中绣娘要十人绣三个月,,,
00:03:16.920,00:03:17.670,方能得一匹,00:03:14.560,00:03:20.860,"I heard that a piece takes ten weavers three months
to produce and is worth 20 galleons of gold."
00:03:18.240,00:03:20.310,一寸之价可比十斗金,,,
00:03:21.360,00:03:23.510,平时连见都很难见一面,,,
00:03:23.840,00:03:25.710,更别说做成鞋面了,00:03:22.440,00:03:26.840,"It's rare to even see a piece of Shu Brocade,
let alone a pair of shoes made from it."
00:03:28.040,00:03:29.070,多谢皇上,,,
00:03:30.000,00:03:31.870,只是这蜀锦是从哪儿来的,00:03:29.140,00:03:30.740,I am grateful to His Majesty.
00:03:32.600,00:03:35.070,我记得蜀中的贡缎 二月时才到过,00:03:31.060,00:03:33.340,But I'm wondering where the Shu Brocade came from.
00:03:35.440,00:03:37.030,只送了皇后和太后宫中,00:03:33.660,00:03:38.260,"I remember that it was offered as tribute in February
to the Express and the Empress Dowager."
00:03:37.440,00:03:39.870,新到的总得明处二月才有啊,00:03:38.620,00:03:40.860,"The new offerings should arrive next February, shouldn't they?"
00:03:40.120,00:03:42.110,这才是皇上对小主的殊宠啊,00:03:41.240,00:03:43.280,"This is a special gift from His Majesty, My Lady."
00:03:42.400,00:03:43.910,蜀锦局有了新的花色,,,
00:03:44.240,00:03:45.470,千里迢迢送来,00:03:43.580,00:03:46.480,The Textile Department of Shu produced a new design and sent it all the way here.
00:03:45.840,00:03:46.710,就这么一匹,00:03:46.500,00:03:48.220,They only offered this one piece.
00:03:46.920,00:03:49.430,皇上就命内务府连日赶制了出来,00:03:48.320,00:03:50.640,His Majesty had the Household Department work day and night making the shoes.
00:03:50.000,00:03:51.870,皇上驾到,00:03:50.960,00:03:52.460,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:03:52.280,00:03:53.590,说曹操曹操就到了,00:03:52.740,00:03:54.740,Speak of the devil.
00:03:56.240,00:03:57.630,臣妾给皇上请安,,,
00:03:57.960,00:03:59.150,皇上万福金安,00:03:56.940,00:04:00.100,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:04:00.440,00:04:02.590,快穿上这玉鞋让朕瞧瞧吧,00:04:01.640,00:04:04.400,"You should put on the shoes.
I want to see you wearing them."
00:04:10.040,00:04:10.790,好看吗,,,
00:04:11.880,00:04:13.110,正好合你的脚,00:04:11.160,00:04:12.920,How do they look?
00:04:13.720,00:04:15.350,看来朕没嘱咐错,00:04:13.320,00:04:15.700,They fit you perfectly. I remembered correctly.
00:04:15.520,00:04:16.270,什么,,,
00:04:16.640,00:04:18.030,朕命针工局的人,00:04:16.160,00:04:17.620,Remembered what?
00:04:18.680,00:04:20.190,按照你脚的尺寸做,00:04:17.840,00:04:22.460,I remembered your size correctly when I made the order.
00:04:20.520,00:04:21.390,果然没错,,,
00:04:22.000,00:04:24.390,可臣妾似乎没有对皇上说过,,,
00:04:24.760,00:04:26.030,臣妾双足的尺寸啊,00:04:23.000,00:04:26.960,"But I've never told Your Majesty the size
of my feet."
00:04:26.680,00:04:28.950,朕与你共枕而眠多日,,,
00:04:29.320,00:04:30.430,怎会不晓得这个,00:04:27.700,00:04:31.340,How could I not know that of someone I share a pillow with?
00:04:31.280,00:04:33.030,朕特地嘱咐绣院的人,,,
00:04:33.360,00:04:34.870,将花样绣成了鸳鸯,00:04:32.420,00:04:35.500,"I specially ordered mandarin ducks
[symbolizing lifelong couples] to be embroidered on them."
00:04:36.280,00:04:37.070,皇上,,,
00:04:37.800,00:04:38.590,嬛嬛,00:04:37.360,00:04:38.920,Your Majesty...
00:04:39.520,00:04:40.350,是不是朕,,,
00:04:40.840,00:04:42.630,有什么地方让你不高兴了,00:04:39.060,00:04:43.400,"Huan Huan, is there something I did that made you unhappy?"
00:04:43.440,00:04:46.030,从行宫回来你仿佛总有心事,00:04:43.560,00:04:46.740,"I sense there is something on your mind
since our return from the Summer Palace."
00:04:46.320,00:04:49.150,没有 皇上没有叫臣妾不高兴,00:04:47.160,00:04:50.120,"No, there's nothing like that."
00:04:50.880,00:04:53.710,只是皇上对臣妾太好,,,
00:04:54.960,00:04:56.750,反而臣妾会有些害怕,00:04:51.280,00:04:58.100,"It makes me a little worried that
Your Majesty is so good to me."
00:04:57.360,00:04:58.190,别怕,,,
00:04:59.160,00:05:01.990,朕答应许你的 必然会给你,00:04:58.400,00:05:04.180,Don't worry.  I'll keep my promises and protect you.
00:05:02.520,00:05:03.710,朕会护着你的,,,
00:05:05.280,00:05:08.310,四郎宠嬛嬛 嬛嬛都知道,00:05:06.460,00:05:10.020,"I understand, Si Lang."
00:05:09.720,00:05:13.510,只是四郎从前也是这么宠着华妃,00:05:10.540,00:05:16.360,But you used to be just as fond of Consort Fleur and Meizhuang.
00:05:14.040,00:05:15.150,宠着眉姐姐,,,
00:05:16.680,00:05:18.630,嬛嬛怕四郎只是宠而已,00:05:17.240,00:05:20.340,I am afraid that your fondness is not love.
00:05:19.640,00:05:23.790,宠爱 宠爱这宠便是爱,00:05:20.640,00:05:25.420,Fondness is a demonstration of love.
00:05:24.360,00:05:25.470,若是宠而不爱呢,00:05:25.720,00:05:28.000,What if there is no love?
00:05:30.800,00:05:33.870,或许四郎待嬛嬛会例外一些,00:05:30.740,00:05:35.220,"Si Lang, would I be an exception to your love?"
00:05:36.120,00:05:38.030,只要这许多的宠里面,,,
00:05:38.360,00:05:39.550,有那么些许爱,,,
00:05:40.200,00:05:41.470,嬛嬛就很高兴了,00:05:37.040,00:05:43.340,I will rejoice in any amount of love in your fondness.
00:05:43.320,00:05:44.350,真是傻话,00:05:44.280,00:05:45.800,You're being silly.
00:05:54.680,00:05:56.390,何当共剪西窗烛,,,
00:05:56.760,00:05:58.230,却话巴山夜雨时,00:05:55.040,00:05:59.240,"“When will we trim the candle wick at the westward window,
and talk about this moment of the rain in the Daba Mountains?”"
00:05:59.480,00:06:01.310,皇上与臣妾共同剪蜡烛,,,
00:06:01.720,00:06:04.830,外头朗朗星空却无夜雨可话呢,00:06:00.440,00:06:05.860,"We trim the wick here under a clear sky of stars.
There's not a ""moment of rain"" to talk about."
00:06:05.840,00:06:07.630,京都晴空朗星,,,
00:06:09.000,00:06:12.430,十七弟的书信中却说蜀中多雨,00:06:06.680,00:06:13.060,"The nights are clear here in Beijing,
but Yunlin's letter said that it rained a lot in Sichuan."
00:06:13.520,00:06:17.030,幸好他留居的巴山夜雨之景甚美,00:06:14.420,00:06:18.780,"Fortunately, his rainy nights in the Daba Mountains were as beautiful as in the poem."
00:06:17.800,00:06:20.070,倒也安慰旅途之困,00:06:18.780,00:06:21.780,It eased his tiredness along the journey.
00:06:25.880,00:06:26.710,如何,00:06:27.000,00:06:28.080,Look at this.
00:06:27.240,00:06:30.230,快马加鞭就是这么快,00:06:28.360,00:06:31.360,They spurred the fastest horse to deliver it.
00:06:31.040,00:06:33.070,一骑红尘妃子笑嘛,00:06:32.160,00:06:35.480,"""They galloped through the dust for a consort's smile"".
[from a poem about delivering lychees to Yang Guifei]"
00:06:34.880,00:06:37.390,只是这颜色不是本宫喜欢的,00:06:36.000,00:06:38.520,"Unfortunately, I'm not fond of this color."
00:06:38.000,00:06:39.350,做衣如做人,00:06:39.040,00:06:40.640,You are what you wear.
00:06:39.920,00:06:43.270,一定要花团锦簇轰轰烈烈才好,00:06:41.000,00:06:44.380,It must be ablaze with colorful flowers.
00:06:44.080,00:06:46.670,娘娘素日里喜欢明丽艳烈的颜色,00:06:45.200,00:06:47.790,Your Highness usually wears vibrant colors.
00:06:47.240,00:06:49.670,其实这颜色倒也雅致,00:06:48.360,00:06:50.800,"However, these colors are also elegant."
00:06:50.560,00:06:52.630,如今不在贡蜀锦的时候,00:06:51.600,00:06:53.980,"They don't usually produce Shu Brocade
at this time of the year,"
00:06:52.880,00:06:53.710,能得这两匹,,,
00:06:54.080,00:06:56.230,想必也费了很大功夫了,00:06:53.980,00:06:57.200,They must have made a great effort to acquire these two pieces.
00:06:57.400,00:06:59.910,其实啊 他们也用了心思了,00:06:58.420,00:07:01.200,They put a lot of thought into this gift indeed.
00:07:00.520,00:07:01.390,娘娘您瞧,,,
00:07:01.800,00:07:04.670,连这花朵都是用月白色的丝线,00:07:01.600,00:07:03.140,"If Your Highness didn't notice,"
00:07:04.920,00:07:06.030,掺了银线绣的,00:07:03.140,00:07:07.220,These flowers were embroidered using moon-white threads intertwined with silver threads.
00:07:06.640,00:07:09.590,若是放在日头底下一定好看,00:07:07.760,00:07:11.100,It will shine brightly in the sun.
00:07:10.800,00:07:12.630,难得他们这点孝心,00:07:11.920,00:07:13.760,That must be so difficult for them.
00:07:13.080,00:07:14.270,也好让人知道,,,
00:07:14.920,00:07:16.310,再名贵的东西,,,
00:07:16.720,00:07:19.310,只要本宫想要即刻就有,00:07:14.160,00:07:20.000,"But everyone should know that I get what I want
even if it is rare and costly."
00:07:20.360,00:07:22.750,是不像有些人,00:07:21.360,00:07:22.360,Yes.
00:07:23.280,00:07:25.430,就算穿上了蜀锦做的鞋子,,,
00:07:25.840,00:07:29.230,终究是穿上龙袍也不像太子啊,00:07:22.760,00:07:30.220,"Unlike someone wearing the Shu Brocade shoes.
She's still not a princess although wearing a royal garment."
00:07:30.680,00:07:32.990,那便吩咐绣院做身衣裳吧,00:07:31.800,00:07:34.280,I shall have the brocade made into two dresses.
00:07:34.680,00:07:36.270,本宫瞧着别的还好,00:07:35.800,00:07:37.480,Everything seems fine ...
00:07:37.200,00:07:40.190,怎么这花朵的样式没见过呢,00:07:38.340,00:07:40.980,except that I don't recognize this flower.
00:07:40.400,00:07:41.070,是了,,,
00:07:41.360,00:07:43.470,以前只见牡丹凤凰的,00:07:41.420,00:07:44.540,"Yes, Your Highness usually receives patterns of peony or phoenix."
00:07:44.160,00:07:45.710,这个倒也新鲜,00:07:45.280,00:07:47.160,This is quite special.
00:07:46.520,00:07:49.510,你们也来瞧瞧这是个什么花啊,00:07:47.640,00:07:50.880,Does anyone know what flower this is?
00:07:52.960,00:07:56.190,小主这是牵牛花呢也叫做夕颜,00:07:53.980,00:07:57.320,"My Lady, this is a morning glory,
also known as ""the face of eventide"" ."
00:07:56.920,00:07:58.110,这样乡气,00:07:57.920,00:07:59.340,How rustic!
00:07:58.640,00:08:01.110,这花夕开朝落向来只开一夜,00:07:59.760,00:08:02.240,This flower blooms at dawn and withers the next morning.
00:08:01.480,00:08:02.670,不见天日便凋谢了,00:08:02.340,00:08:03.640,It fades before even seeing the sunlight.
00:08:02.920,00:08:05.390,住口 不吉利的话不许说,00:08:03.660,00:08:04.820,Stop!
00:08:06.040,00:08:06.950,混账,00:08:05.100,00:08:06.900,You are not allowed to utter such inauspicious words.
00:08:07.520,00:08:09.430,这蜀锦局越来越不懂规矩了,00:08:07.160,00:08:08.640,Idiots!
00:08:09.840,00:08:11.030,竟敢拿如此薄命的花朵,00:08:08.640,00:08:10.660,The Textile Department of Shu must have lost their minds.
00:08:11.360,00:08:12.230,来糊弄本宫,00:08:10.960,00:08:13.760,How dare they offer me brocade with these ill-fated flowers?
00:08:13.640,00:08:14.110,颂芝,,,
00:08:14.400,00:08:14.950,是,,,
00:08:15.200,00:08:16.390,把这两匹布给它撕碎了,00:08:14.760,00:08:15.980,"- Song Zhi.
- Yes."
00:08:16.840,00:08:17.670,送回蜀锦局去,00:08:16.280,00:08:18.720,Tear them up and send them back to the Textile Department.
00:08:18.000,00:08:18.470,是,00:08:19.060,00:08:19.700,Yes.
00:08:18.720,00:08:21.110,娘娘这花一般人不认识,,,
00:08:21.480,00:08:22.870,难免失误也是有的,00:08:19.800,00:08:23.980,"Your Highness, they probably have never saw this flower before."
00:08:23.440,00:08:24.830,娘娘撕了事小,,,
00:08:25.360,00:08:27.030,可若传到旁人的耳朵里,00:08:24.440,00:08:29.880,"Although the cloth itself is unimportant, destroying it can churn up gossip in the palace."
00:08:27.360,00:08:29.070,难免又引起风言风语,,,
00:08:29.720,00:08:31.470,既然这花一般人不认得,,,
00:08:32.080,00:08:34.070,娘娘不如当作不知道,00:08:30.840,00:08:32.960,"Since most people don't know this flower,"
00:08:34.560,00:08:36.350,随便赏人就是了,00:08:33.200,00:08:37.240,Your Highness might as well award the brocade to someone unaware of its meaning.
00:08:37.480,00:08:38.870,那便赏她吧,,,
00:08:39.400,00:08:40.190,谁,00:08:38.440,00:08:40.040,I'll give it to her.
00:08:40.760,00:08:42.430,她有那样一双鞋子,00:08:40.340,00:08:41.400,Who?
00:08:42.880,00:08:44.470,再配这样一身衣裳,00:08:41.940,00:08:45.240,She already has the matching shoes.
00:08:45.320,00:08:47.510,才显得是皇上心尖儿上的人,00:08:46.240,00:08:48.760,A complete outfit will accentuate her place in His Majesty's heart.
00:08:52.240,00:08:53.670,姐姐你们可回来了,00:08:53.300,00:08:54.800,"Sourire, you are finally back."
00:08:54.040,00:08:56.070,你们和安姐姐都去了圆明园行宫,00:08:54.980,00:08:57.200,You all went to the Summer Palace.
00:08:56.480,00:08:57.390,独我一人在这里,,,
00:08:57.720,00:08:58.630,实在是闷坏了,00:08:57.320,00:08:59.620,"I was left alone all this time.
It was so boring."
00:08:58.920,00:09:00.350,不是有姑姑陪着你吗,,,
00:09:00.800,00:09:02.630,我宫里的姑姑整天训我,00:09:00.120,00:09:01.700,Wasn't your etiquette instructor with you?
00:09:02.960,00:09:03.710,嫌我话多,00:09:01.800,00:09:04.680,She was always critical of me for being too talkative.
00:09:04.360,00:09:05.230,让我静心,,,
00:09:05.720,00:09:06.310,说一静心,00:09:05.040,00:09:06.540,She told me to cultivate inner peace.
00:09:06.560,00:09:08.230,就能像安姐姐一样得宠了,00:09:06.840,00:09:09.700,"""You would be favored by His Majesty
if you are more like Attendant An""."
00:09:09.440,00:09:11.310,姑姑教你你就该好好早着,00:09:10.560,00:09:12.900,You should listen to her. She is your instructor.
00:09:12.440,00:09:13.270,姑姑还说,,,
00:09:13.520,00:09:14.630,我都进宫一处了,00:09:13.400,00:09:14.480,She also said that
00:09:14.880,00:09:15.990,还没和皇上说上话,00:09:14.580,00:09:17.600,"I haven't even had a chance to talk to His Majesty
after an entire year living in the palace"
00:09:17.200,00:09:18.590,说我成天没个安静,00:09:18.220,00:09:20.020,and that I'm noisy all day.
00:09:19.440,00:09:21.990,其实见了皇上要守的规矩更多,00:09:20.460,00:09:23.300,I will have to obey even more rules if I see His Majesty.
00:09:22.560,00:09:23.670,我才不乐意呢,00:09:23.580,00:09:25.100,I'd rather not.
00:09:24.680,00:09:26.830,这话等你见了皇上再说,00:09:25.600,00:09:28.100,Tell that to His Majesty when you see him.
00:09:28.160,00:09:30.470,小主 翊坤宫的周公公来了,00:09:29.140,00:09:32.060,"My Lady, Mr Zhou from the Palace of Earthly Honor."
00:09:34.200,00:09:36.110,奴才给莞贵人请安,00:09:35.320,00:09:37.240,Peace to Lady Sourire.
00:09:36.440,00:09:37.230,起来吧,,,
00:09:37.480,00:09:38.430,谢莞贵人,00:09:37.440,00:09:38.340,Rise.
,,,00:09:38.600,00:09:40.180,"Thank you, Lady Sourire."
00:09:41.000,00:09:43.510,华妃娘娘新得了两匹蜀锦,00:09:42.120,00:09:44.640,Her Highness Consort Fleur just received two pieces of Shu Brocade.
00:09:43.960,00:09:45.630,想来颜色清淡好看,00:09:44.880,00:09:46.820,"Her Highness found the colors clean and refreshing,"
00:09:45.920,00:09:48.710,就让人裁了两身衣裳送与小主,00:09:46.840,00:09:50.160,so she had them made into two garments for you.
00:09:50.080,00:09:50.950,多谢娘娘,,,
00:09:51.880,00:09:53.230,槿汐 收下吧,00:09:51.200,00:09:52.660,I thank Her Highness.
00:09:57.320,00:09:58.270,回娘娘话,00:09:53.000,00:09:54.360,"Jinxi, take them."
00:09:58.760,00:10:00.190,这衣裳颜色雅致,00:09:58.440,00:09:59.760,"To Her Highness,"
00:10:00.440,00:10:01.910,手工精巧倒是极好,00:09:59.880,00:10:02.800,the dresses are exquisitely crafted and of most elegant colors.
00:10:02.560,00:10:06.150,只是宝华殿的法师上回来说了,00:10:03.680,00:10:07.440,"However, the priest from the Baohua Hall said"
00:10:07.120,00:10:09.390,今处贵人与鼠犯冲,00:10:08.140,00:10:11.340,"Lady Sourire clashes with ""shu"" [the zodiac animal Rat] this year"
00:10:10.840,00:10:13.870,同音不同字的也容易惹是非,00:10:11.780,00:10:15.200,"which is a homophone of the ""Shu"" Brocade."
00:10:14.680,00:10:18.270,这个蜀锦嘛 做成鞋踩在脚下,00:10:15.440,00:10:20.160,"It is fine to wear shoes made of Shu Brocade because then ""shu"" is beneath you."
00:10:18.680,00:10:19.590,也就罢了,,,
00:10:20.360,00:10:21.550,若做成衣裳,00:10:21.480,00:10:23.400,But if the Shu Brocade is made into dresses ...
00:10:22.560,00:10:24.470,怕是得明年才能上身了,00:10:23.600,00:10:25.400,"I'm afraid you will have to wear them next year, My Lady."
00:10:24.680,00:10:26.030,槿汐姑娘的意思是,00:10:25.600,00:10:27.840,"Jinxi, if I'm understanding correctly,"
00:10:27.120,00:10:29.830,娘娘赏的衣裳小主便不能穿了,00:10:28.080,00:10:31.260,Lady Sourire cannot wear the dresses if they are awarded by Her Highness?
00:10:30.920,00:10:34.110,也是 小主现在新得皇上恩宠,00:10:32.200,00:10:35.000,"Indeed, Lady Sourire is now in high favor."
00:10:34.400,00:10:35.670,除了皇上的赏赐,,,
00:10:36.000,00:10:38.430,旁人的东西又何尝放在眼里,00:10:35.600,00:10:39.300,She will not even look at gifts from anyone else.
00:10:39.200,00:10:40.590,倒是我们娘娘常说,,,
00:10:41.000,00:10:42.070,身正不畏邪,00:10:40.240,00:10:41.400,Her Highness always says that
00:10:42.600,00:10:44.510,法师之言固然不能不信,00:10:41.400,00:10:43.300,an upstanding person should have no fear of evil spirits.
00:10:44.840,00:10:47.230,但娘娘恩惠福泽庇佑,00:10:43.700,00:10:45.700,"Although we cannot distrust the priests,"
00:10:47.560,00:10:50.350,相信对小主还是有所裨益的,00:10:45.880,00:10:51.280,"Her Highness' grace and blessings
 will also protect you from evil, My Lady."
00:10:50.760,00:10:52.190,槿汐也是好意提醒,,,
00:10:52.480,00:10:53.470,公公不必在意,00:10:51.860,00:10:53.400,Jinxi was reminding me with good intention.
00:10:55.040,00:10:56.270,替我回禀娘娘,00:10:53.440,00:10:55.240,"You must not misunderstand her, sir."
00:10:56.600,00:10:57.550,改日我再去谢恩,00:10:56.020,00:10:58.380,Please inform Her Highness that I will personally thank her another day.
00:10:57.760,00:11:00.670,如此 奴才告退,00:10:58.840,00:11:01.900,"If so, I shall take my leave."
00:11:06.200,00:11:07.430,我瞧瞧 我瞧瞧,00:11:07.200,00:11:09.900,Come here. Let me look at it.
00:11:12.080,00:11:13.470,这衣服真好看呢,00:11:13.200,00:11:14.880,The dress is so beautiful!
00:11:14.640,00:11:16.870,姐姐怎么收了衣裳还不高兴呢,00:11:15.760,00:11:18.200,"Sourire, why do you look unhappy after receiving such beautiful dresses?"
00:11:18.480,00:11:21.710,这是什么花没见过,00:11:18.600,00:11:20.860,What kind of flower is this?
00:11:21.920,00:11:25.510,这是夕颜 牵牛花,00:11:21.940,00:11:23.840,I have never seen it before.
00:11:25.920,00:11:27.830,牵牛有什么说头吗,00:11:24.600,00:11:26.700,"This is ""the face of eventide"", the morning glory."
,,,00:11:26.960,00:11:29.720,The morning glory? Does it symbolize something?
00:11:33.320,00:11:35.190,这 这花倒是好看,00:11:34.000,00:11:36.480,The flower is beautiful indeed.
00:11:36.400,00:11:38.310,只是华妃送礼送得太突然,00:11:37.000,00:11:39.200,But this is such a sudden gift.
00:11:38.720,00:11:40.870,奴婢倒有些看不明白了,00:11:39.800,00:11:42.000,I don't quite understand.
00:11:42.560,00:11:43.550,何止是你,00:11:43.600,00:11:45.060,Nor do I.
00:11:44.400,00:11:46.390,凡事突如其来必有古怪,00:11:45.480,00:11:47.780,It's an odd and unexpected surprise.
00:11:49.120,00:11:50.150,姐姐这件衣服,,,
00:11:50.360,00:11:51.910,和您那双蜀锦的鞋子作配,00:11:50.200,00:11:53.480,"Sourire, isn't the dress a perfect match
for your Shu Brocade shoes?"
00:11:52.160,00:11:52.910,不是正好吗,,,
00:11:53.360,00:11:54.470,十月的赏菊大会,,,
00:11:54.760,00:11:57.070,姐姐穿上这一身绝对是冠压群芳,00:11:54.200,00:11:56.720,You should wear it on the Chrysanthemum Day in October.
00:11:58.720,00:11:59.590,先搁起来吧,00:11:57.120,00:11:58.860,You will put all the other concubines to shame.
,,,00:11:59.780,00:12:01.420,Put them away for now.
00:12:13.640,00:12:14.990,臣妾给太后请安,00:12:14.300,00:12:16.320,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:12:15.960,00:12:17.150,太后万福金安,00:12:17.040,00:12:18.960,May peace and grace be with Your Majesty.
00:12:18.720,00:12:19.510,起来吧,,,
00:12:20.320,00:12:21.150,谢太后,00:12:19.600,00:12:20.860,You may rise.
00:12:22.840,00:12:23.550,坐,00:12:21.420,00:12:22.740,I thank Your Majesty.
00:12:29.520,00:12:30.910,今儿怎么有空来啊,00:12:23.940,00:12:25.440,Have a seat.
00:12:31.360,00:12:33.230,侍奉太后乃臣妾的本分,00:12:30.500,00:12:32.300,It is good that you have a chance to visit me today.
00:12:33.640,00:12:34.870,皇上忙于朝政,00:12:32.580,00:12:34.340,It is my duty to serve Your Majesty.
,,,00:12:34.840,00:12:36.460,"While His Majesty is busy with state affairs,"
00:12:35.160,00:12:37.790,臣妾更该替皇上向太后尽孝,00:12:36.460,00:12:38.900,I must fulfill filial piety on his behalf.
00:12:38.600,00:12:40.230,小嘴越发甜了,00:12:39.780,00:12:41.300,That is very sweet of you.
00:12:41.760,00:12:44.110,入秋后夜里格外冷了,00:12:42.800,00:12:45.140,The nights are getting cold in autumn.
00:12:44.760,00:12:46.110,太后还咳嗽吗,00:12:45.780,00:12:47.200,I hope Your Majesty's cough has improved.
00:12:46.400,00:12:47.550,如今好些了,00:12:47.400,00:12:48.500,It has.
00:12:48.440,00:12:50.630,臣妾惦记着太后向来畏寒,00:12:49.540,00:12:51.460,I remember Your Majesty is sensitive to cold.
00:12:50.960,00:12:53.830,特意差人做了件狐皮大氅来,00:12:51.800,00:12:54.500,I ordered a fox fur cloak for Your Majesty.
00:13:01.360,00:13:02.590,是墨狐的狐皮,00:13:02.000,00:13:03.920,Is this the fur of black foxes?
00:13:03.400,00:13:04.190,是,00:13:04.000,00:13:05.500,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:13:04.560,00:13:06.830,臣妾的哥哥在青海平乱,00:13:05.720,00:13:07.820,"When my brother was in Qinghai to quell the rebellions,"
00:13:07.160,00:13:09.270,偶然射猎得了两张墨狐皮,00:13:08.180,00:13:10.460,he hunted two black foxes by chance.
00:13:09.960,00:13:11.470,臣妾想着自己年轻,,,
00:13:11.840,00:13:13.310,穿不出墨狐的大气,00:13:11.240,00:13:14.200,I thought only Your Majesty will bring out the magnificence of this color.
00:13:13.560,00:13:15.990,所以做了件大氅进献给太后,00:13:14.720,00:13:17.360,So I had the fur made into this cloak for Your Majesty.
00:13:17.320,00:13:19.190,臣妾知道太后潜心礼佛,00:13:18.320,00:13:20.400,I know Your Majesty is a devout believer of Buddha.
00:13:20.040,00:13:22.070,特意用西番莲花纹的妆缎,,,
00:13:22.400,00:13:23.230,做了里子,00:13:21.100,00:13:24.200,The lining is specially embroidered with the lotus pattern of Tibetan Buddhism.
00:13:23.640,00:13:27.070,还望太后不要嫌弃臣妾一点拙心,00:13:24.600,00:13:28.000,I hope Your Majesty likes my humble gift.
00:13:28.240,00:13:29.790,难得你这份孝心,,,
00:13:30.600,00:13:32.150,竹息 收下吧,00:13:29.360,00:13:31.320,I appreciate your kind thought.
00:13:32.320,00:13:33.030,是,00:13:31.600,00:13:33.300,"Bamboo, take it."
,,,00:13:33.500,00:13:34.300,Yes.
00:13:37.160,00:13:39.070,今儿怎么穿得这么素净啊,00:13:38.000,00:13:40.240,Why do you dress so plainly today?
00:13:40.480,00:13:42.510,臣妾虽则年轻不懂事,00:13:41.460,00:13:43.820,"Although Your Majesty may see me
as a young and callow concubine,"
00:13:42.880,00:13:45.110,但在嫔妃一辈里也不算年轻了,00:13:43.960,00:13:46.040,I am not young compared to the new concubines.
00:13:45.400,00:13:46.630,自然要素净些,,,
00:13:47.120,00:13:48.910,不像莞贵人跟安常在,00:13:46.340,00:13:47.980,I should dress with more modesty.
00:13:49.240,00:13:50.710,喜欢处轻娇艳的,00:13:48.320,00:13:51.900,Noble Lady Sourire and Attendant An would dress flamboyantly.
00:13:51.680,00:13:53.510,常听你们提起莞贵人,00:13:52.600,00:13:54.720,I do hear about Noble Lady Sourire a lot.
00:13:54.360,00:13:55.590,哀家只记得,,,
00:13:56.160,00:13:57.950,模样儿倒是还挺可人的,00:13:55.520,00:13:58.900,I only remember that she looks lovely.
00:13:58.920,00:14:00.510,太后这几日没见到莞贵人,,,
00:14:00.840,00:14:01.790,才叫可惜呢,00:13:59.800,00:14:02.960,What a shame that Your Majesty hasn't seen her recently.
00:14:02.480,00:14:03.830,皇上赐了莞贵人一双,,,
00:14:04.120,00:14:06.190,织金镂花的蜀锦鞋子,00:14:03.600,00:14:06.800,"His Majesty awarded her a pair of
Shu Brocade shoes woven with gold embroidery."
00:14:06.720,00:14:08.710,连鞋底子都是翠玉做的,00:14:07.700,00:14:10.020,Even the sole is made of jadeite.
00:14:09.520,00:14:11.870,莞贵人又做了两身蜀锦的旗装,00:14:10.500,00:14:13.040,Noble Lady Sourire also made two dresses from Shu Brocade.
00:14:12.280,00:14:15.310,那一水儿穿在身上可标致呢,00:14:13.300,00:14:16.300,Such a glamorous outfit!
00:14:16.120,00:14:17.030,是吗,,,
00:14:17.640,00:14:19.070,可是哀家记得,00:14:17.300,00:14:18.520,Is that so?
00:14:19.400,00:14:21.590,如今不是蜀锦进宫的时候啊,00:14:18.800,00:14:22.760,But I remember the Shu Brocade is not produced at this time of the year.
00:14:22.520,00:14:24.430,莞贵人年轻可人疼,,,
00:14:24.680,00:14:26.310,想要怎么会没有呢,00:14:23.660,00:14:25.460,Lady Sourire is sweet and endearing.
00:14:27.280,00:14:29.150,只是不知这一身蜀锦,00:14:25.700,00:14:28.000,How could His Majesty say no to her requests?
00:14:29.760,00:14:30.990,价值几何呢,00:14:28.400,00:14:31.960,I'm really curious how costly her complete outfit was.
00:14:33.720,00:14:36.990,她刚进宫 皇帝把她当小孩子看,00:14:34.620,00:14:37.780,"She is new to the palace.
The Emperor regards her as a child."
00:14:37.480,00:14:38.790,自然会偏宠些,00:14:38.000,00:14:40.260,That's why she receives more care from him.
00:14:39.200,00:14:42.270,你得皇帝宠爱多年晓得分寸,00:14:40.260,00:14:43.460,"You have been favored by him for years
and understand the standards of decorum."
00:14:42.800,00:14:43.750,该去提点,00:14:43.460,00:14:45.280,You should remind him.
00:14:46.080,00:14:46.990,是,00:14:46.500,00:14:48.180,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:14:49.720,00:14:53.870,依哀家看 皇帝心里你是最重的,00:14:50.480,00:14:55.040,I can see that you take priority in his heart.
00:14:54.480,00:14:55.710,你用的欢宜香,,,
00:14:56.040,00:14:57.950,是皇帝亲自选了香料,00:14:55.620,00:15:00.260,"He personally chose the ingredients of Pleasancy incense
and had it made for you."
00:14:58.200,00:14:59.710,叫人配好送你的,,,
00:15:00.040,00:15:01.310,你看看整个宫里,,,
00:15:01.640,00:15:03.950,皇帝对谁用过这番心思,00:15:00.900,00:15:04.900,"Of the entire palace, who else has he been so thoughtful to?"
00:15:07.800,00:15:08.510,你过来,00:15:08.860,00:15:10.580,Come here.
00:15:16.680,00:15:17.550,臣妾不敢当,00:15:16.860,00:15:19.220,(gasp) I'm unworthy of Your Majesty's gift.
00:15:18.360,00:15:19.150,来,00:15:19.340,00:15:20.720,It's okay.
00:15:20.040,00:15:23.350,这支步摇是哀家刚做德妃的时候,,,
00:15:24.040,00:15:25.470,孝惠太后赏的,00:15:21.240,00:15:26.480,"This hair ornament was awarded by the former Empress
when I was promoted to Consort."
00:15:27.080,00:15:28.790,你如花似玉的年纪,00:15:27.100,00:15:29.800,"You are as pretty as a flower in your prime age,"
00:15:29.120,00:15:30.310,位分又尊贵,,,
00:15:30.560,00:15:32.230,打扮得这么素净做什么,00:15:29.800,00:15:31.540,and ranked highly among the concubines.
,,,00:15:31.540,00:15:33.880,You should dress accordingly.
00:15:32.920,00:15:36.110,依哀家看这步摇给你戴正好,00:15:34.020,00:15:37.460,This phoenix ornament with tassled tail is perfect for you.
00:15:37.760,00:15:39.070,多谢太后疼爱,00:15:37.460,00:15:40.140,I thank Your Majesty.
00:15:39.680,00:15:42.750,哀家疼你就像疼皇帝是一样的,00:15:40.460,00:15:44.200,I care for you the same way I care for the emperor.
00:15:44.640,00:15:46.150,快去换件颜色衣裳,,,
00:15:46.520,00:15:47.990,好好给皇帝瞧瞧去,00:15:45.340,00:15:48.840,"Go change to a brightly-colored dress.
He will like it."
00:15:49.600,00:15:51.230,那臣妾就先告退了,00:15:50.620,00:15:53.740,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:16:14.200,00:16:15.630,娘娘的步摇真好看,00:16:14.660,00:16:17.000,Your Highness's new phoenix tassel is so pretty.
00:16:16.120,00:16:17.510,只是没出这口恶气,,,
00:16:17.880,00:16:19.150,真是让人不痛快,00:16:17.080,00:16:20.260,But it pains me that we couldn't get Zhen Huan condemned.
00:16:19.520,00:16:20.590,还用得着你说,00:16:20.520,00:16:22.580,I don't need you to remind me.
00:16:22.280,00:16:25.350,不过太后这样疼本宫也算难得了,00:16:23.360,00:16:26.460,But it was unusual that Her Majesty was so nice to me.
00:16:25.600,00:16:26.270,是啦,,,
00:16:26.880,00:16:28.110,去把檀香点上,00:16:26.460,00:16:27.620,Exactly.
00:16:28.600,00:16:30.510,再把哀家的法华经拿来,00:16:27.880,00:16:29.520,Light the sandalwood.
00:16:31.920,00:16:34.350,太后也觉得这屋子里酸气太重,00:16:29.700,00:16:32.020,And bring my Lotus Sutra.
00:16:34.640,00:16:35.590,要驱一驱,00:16:32.980,00:16:37.220,"I expected Your Majesty would wish to dissipate
the sourness of jealousy in the chamber."
00:16:36.640,00:16:39.030,后宫里争风吃醋是惯有的事,00:16:37.600,00:16:40.140,Jealousy is a common brew in the harem.
00:16:39.560,00:16:41.110,还用得着大惊小怪吗,00:16:40.480,00:16:42.480,I've become accustomed to its smell.
00:16:41.760,00:16:43.670,奴婢也不在乎这点醋劲,00:16:42.640,00:16:44.740,"So have I, Your Majesty."
00:16:43.920,00:16:46.070,而是华妃娘娘这么大费周章,00:16:45.000,00:16:47.580,But Consort Fleur made such a fuss about it.
00:16:46.720,00:16:48.870,想那莞贵人是何等人物,00:16:47.680,00:16:50.120,It is hard to imagine what Lady Sourire is like!
00:16:49.400,00:16:50.830,你又不是不知道华妃,,,
00:16:51.480,00:16:52.750,动不动就爱吃醋,00:16:50.380,00:16:53.680,You know Consort Fleur. She is the jealous type ...
00:16:53.320,00:16:54.750,打进王府便这样,00:16:54.100,00:16:56.020,ever since she married in.
00:16:56.120,00:16:57.430,倒是皇帝不好,00:16:57.000,00:16:58.940,The emperor is to blame for this.
00:16:58.120,00:17:01.430,一大把年纪还不顾周全,00:16:59.260,00:17:02.320,He's still being inconsiderate at this age.
00:17:01.880,00:17:02.950,让哀家操心,00:17:02.540,00:17:04.320,I still have to worry about him.
00:17:03.560,00:17:04.870,太后还操心,00:17:04.560,00:17:06.280,Your Majesty must not worry.
00:17:05.320,00:17:08.030,您哪 是最该享清福的人了,00:17:06.280,00:17:09.200,Your Majesty is the last person who should worry.
00:17:11.320,00:17:13.030,你去养心殿告诉一声,,,
00:17:13.520,00:17:16.110,皇帝忙完政事请他过来一趟,00:17:12.320,00:17:16.980,"Go to the Hall of Mental Cultivation
and tell him to come over after work."
00:17:16.920,00:17:17.630,是,00:17:18.040,00:17:19.820,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:17:31.560,00:17:33.750,皇上驾到,00:17:32.200,00:17:34.740,His Majesty the Emperor!
00:17:38.560,00:17:40.550,儿子给皇额娘请安,00:17:39.700,00:17:41.840,"Peace and grace to you, Mother."
00:17:40.960,00:17:41.630,坐,00:17:41.960,00:17:43.200,Have a seat.
00:17:42.760,00:17:44.350,这两天天气冷了,00:17:43.600,00:17:45.640,It’s getting colder these days.
00:17:45.280,00:17:47.230,怎么也不知道多加件衣裳,00:17:45.640,00:17:48.200,Why didn't you put on a coat?
00:17:47.480,00:17:48.950,方才从养心殿出来,,,
00:17:49.240,00:17:50.270,一时倒也不觉得冷,00:17:48.460,00:17:51.420,I'm not cold. I just came from the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:17:51.720,00:17:53.310,苏培盛也不提醒着,00:17:52.880,00:17:54.800,"Su Peisheng, you should have reminded him."
00:17:54.880,00:17:57.110,奴才的疏忽 请太后恕罪,00:17:55.700,00:17:58.140,"It was my negligence.
I beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness."
00:17:57.600,00:17:59.910,苏培盛十分尽心,00:17:58.700,00:18:01.060,Su Peisheng is a very considerate person.
00:18:00.920,00:18:02.070,只是他这么一个人,,,
00:18:02.560,00:18:04.070,也总有顾不到的地方,00:18:01.900,00:18:05.340,"But even so, he can't attend to everything."
00:18:04.960,00:18:06.390,皇额娘既然说了,,,
00:18:06.640,00:18:08.670,儿子回去加件衣裳便是了,00:18:06.040,00:18:09.720,"If Mother says so, I will put on a coat after I go back."
00:18:09.120,00:18:12.470,也罢 苏培盛起来吧,00:18:09.920,00:18:13.660,"All right. Su Peisheng, you may rise."
00:18:12.960,00:18:13.950,谢太后宽恕,00:18:14.020,00:18:15.720,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:14.760,00:18:17.870,奴才日后一定尽心尽力伺候皇上,00:18:15.780,00:18:18.960,I will be most attentive in serving His Majesty in the future.
00:18:19.480,00:18:20.470,话说回来,00:18:20.540,00:18:22.200,"Speaking of service,"
00:18:21.520,00:18:24.310,这些事除了奴才要当心,00:18:22.500,00:18:25.520,"not only should the servants be careful,"
00:18:25.040,00:18:27.870,更该的是嫔妃们要留意,00:18:26.100,00:18:29.640,but the concubines should also pay more attention.
00:18:29.480,00:18:32.790,皇帝身边那个莞贵人可还尽心吗,00:18:30.560,00:18:34.200,Is the Noble Lady Sourire diligent in her duties?
00:18:34.080,00:18:35.230,这可不好说了,,,
00:18:36.160,00:18:37.430,若说她尽心,00:18:34.980,00:18:36.620,That is hard to say.
00:18:37.960,00:18:39.910,今儿儿子贪凉穿少了,00:18:37.080,00:18:38.740,"If I say she is,"
00:18:40.800,00:18:43.390,皇额娘定要责备她不尽心,00:18:38.940,00:18:44.580,Mother would blame her for not reminding me to dress warmly today
00:18:44.480,00:18:46.110,还要怪儿子偏袒,00:18:45.220,00:18:47.440,and me for being partial to her.
00:18:46.960,00:18:48.350,若说她不尽心,,,
00:18:49.760,00:18:52.510,实在她也是个细心之人,00:18:47.840,00:18:53.600,"If I say she is not, she is a very thoughtful overall."
00:18:54.320,00:18:56.870,只是最近儿子忙于朝政,,,
00:18:57.240,00:18:59.310,与她也有三四日未见了,00:18:55.280,00:19:00.180,"But I have been busy with work and
haven't seen her for three or four days."
00:19:01.440,00:19:03.470,皇上您还说不偏袒,00:19:02.500,00:19:04.580,Your Majesty said you are not partial to her.
00:19:04.360,00:19:06.470,这便是实打实的偏袒了,00:19:05.220,00:19:07.540,That's truly partiality.
00:19:07.080,00:19:08.670,姑姑别笑话朕了,00:19:07.940,00:19:10.400,"Madam, please don't tease me."
00:19:10.360,00:19:12.430,皇帝政务繁忙,00:19:11.160,00:19:13.680,"When you were occupied with state affairs,"
00:19:12.880,00:19:15.350,也不过是三四日没有见她而已,00:19:13.860,00:19:16.360,you would only see her every three or four days.
00:19:15.960,00:19:18.590,那你多久才见华妃一次,00:19:16.920,00:19:19.700,"So how often did you see Consort Fleur,"
00:19:19.440,00:19:21.190,多久见皇后一次,00:19:20.280,00:19:22.280,"the Empress,"
00:19:21.760,00:19:23.750,多久见敬嫔她们一次,00:19:22.900,00:19:25.180,and Concubine Estime and the other concubines?
00:19:26.400,00:19:27.830,皇帝既然忙碌,,,
00:19:28.480,00:19:30.830,三宫六院都少见也罢了,00:19:27.500,00:19:32.040,It's all right to pay fewer visits to the harem when you are busy.
00:19:32.080,00:19:34.310,可是如果显得太有亲疏了,,,
00:19:34.960,00:19:36.990,就会伤了嫔妃们的心哪,00:19:33.060,00:19:38.240,But it will upset some concubines if you show favoritism for the others.
00:19:39.920,00:19:41.270,皇额娘教训的是,00:19:40.760,00:19:42.760,"You are right, Mother."
00:19:42.160,00:19:43.070,儿子记住了,00:19:43.160,00:19:44.760,I will remember your advice.
00:19:46.440,00:19:47.950,这样好的墨狐皮,00:19:47.340,00:19:49.340,The black fox fur of such quality ...
00:19:48.400,00:19:50.950,怕是青海那边才会有的,00:19:49.340,00:19:51.780,must be produced in Qinghai.
00:19:53.040,00:19:54.910,皇帝真是眼明心亮,00:19:54.100,00:19:56.340,Your Majesty has sharp eyes and a sharp mind.
00:19:55.520,00:19:56.470,殿里这么暗,,,
00:19:56.720,00:19:58.470,也看得清是墨狐的皮子,00:19:56.480,00:19:59.560,You can see the black fox fur in such a dim chamber.
00:19:58.880,00:20:02.310,后宫朝政自然更是洞若观火,00:20:00.000,00:20:03.640,"I hope you will also see the harem and the court
""as bright as a blazing fire."""
00:20:06.240,00:20:09.750,这件墨狐大氅用的是墨狐的狐皮,00:20:07.180,00:20:10.900,This fur cloak is made of black fox fur indeed.
00:20:10.480,00:20:11.670,华妃特意选了,,,
00:20:11.960,00:20:14.430,西番莲花的妆缎做里子,00:20:11.420,00:20:15.820,"Consort Fleur specially had the lining embroidered
with the lotus pattern from Tibetan Buddhism."
00:20:15.200,00:20:18.190,这才叫内外得当 相得益彰,00:20:16.000,00:20:19.420,The inside and the outside complement each other.
00:20:20.400,00:20:23.710,皇额娘的教训 儿子听得明白,00:20:21.320,00:20:25.140,"I completely understand, Mother."
00:20:25.400,00:20:26.510,今儿早说,,,
00:20:26.720,00:20:28.910,皇额娘赏了华妃一支步摇,00:20:26.460,00:20:30.160,I heard that you awarded Consort Fleur a hairpin today.
00:20:29.800,00:20:34.630,想来夜晚烛光下更见华光,00:20:30.920,00:20:36.000,I believe it will be beautifully lit by the candlelight at night.
00:20:35.360,00:20:38.030,儿子定要好好细赏一番,00:20:36.360,00:20:39.280,I am going to admire its beauty.
00:20:39.600,00:20:43.630,恩威并施除了用在朝廷之上,00:20:40.640,00:20:44.620,Not only must you balance favor and force in the imperial court
00:20:44.240,00:20:46.150,后宫也是一样的,00:20:45.280,00:20:47.580,but also in the harem.
00:20:47.280,00:20:50.910,现在西北平定剩下些扫尾之事,00:20:48.380,00:20:52.440,"While the rebellions in the northwest are settling down,"
00:20:51.880,00:20:54.910,可是西南土司还是心腹之患,00:20:52.900,00:20:56.260,the tribal chiefs in the southwest remain an internal threat.
00:20:55.400,00:20:58.390,想要安定还要大费一番周折,00:20:56.480,00:20:59.740,It will require great effort to pacify them.
00:20:59.400,00:21:02.150,年羹尧有才 也还算是忠心,00:21:00.360,00:21:03.140,Nian Gengyao is capable and loyal.
00:21:02.520,00:21:05.310,这样的功臣只要他不骄横起来,,,
00:21:05.880,00:21:07.750,皇帝是该好好用着,00:21:03.400,00:21:08.940,"You should assign important duties to him
as long as he does not become imperious."
00:21:09.080,00:21:11.150,平定西陲是大功之事,00:21:09.920,00:21:12.540,It is an extraordinary feat to pacify the west.
00:21:12.120,00:21:15.510,十月里年羹尧会进京觐见,00:21:13.220,00:21:16.660,Nian Gengyao will pay respects to the palace in October.
00:21:16.160,00:21:18.510,儿子定会好好嘉奖于他,00:21:17.160,00:21:20.240,I will surely reward him very well.
00:21:21.640,00:21:23.630,华妃的欢宜香用完了,00:21:22.660,00:21:24.780,Consort Fleur is running out of Pleasancy.
00:21:24.160,00:21:26.390,此香制作繁琐不易得,00:21:25.120,00:21:27.640,Making this incense is a complicated process.
00:21:27.760,00:21:30.230,皇帝是否不再赏她了,00:21:28.800,00:21:31.220,Do you wish to stop awarding it to her?
00:21:30.840,00:21:33.350,这么多年她都用惯了,00:21:31.920,00:21:35.200,"Since she is very used to using it,"
00:21:34.600,00:21:36.110,自然是要赏给她的,00:21:35.680,00:21:37.660,I shall not stop giving it to her.

00:21:44.080,00:21:44.870,娘娘,,,
00:21:45.200,00:21:46.070,哥哥回来了吗,00:21:45.100,00:21:46.280,Your Highness.
00:21:46.440,00:21:48.630,大将军平定西陲还朝请安,00:21:46.340,00:21:47.740,Is my brother back?
00:21:48.880,00:21:50.150,先去觐见皇上了,00:21:47.880,00:21:50.040,"Yes, the great general has returned to the court from the west"
00:21:50.680,00:21:52.390,皇上一向厚待大将军,00:21:50.040,00:21:51.900,and he went to pay respects to His Majesty.
00:21:52.600,00:21:54.990,此刻定有许多要紧的话要说呢,00:21:51.900,00:21:53.900,His Majesty has always been generous to the great general.
00:21:55.720,00:21:56.670,这是自然,00:21:54.100,00:21:56.580,They must be having an important conversation right now.
00:21:57.600,00:22:00.030,不过午膳时间了,00:21:56.880,00:21:58.520,Of course.
00:22:00.600,00:22:02.550,皇上和哥哥再有要事商量,00:21:58.780,00:22:01.340,But it's already lunch time.
00:22:03.200,00:22:04.310,也要顾着吃饭哪,00:22:01.880,00:22:05.440,They need to have lunch even though they have important matters to discuss.
00:22:05.040,00:22:05.910,启禀娘娘,00:22:06.060,00:22:07.700,Your Highness.
00:22:08.120,00:22:09.230,皇上有旨,,,
00:22:09.520,00:22:11.830,请娘娘到养心殿一起用膳,00:22:09.260,00:22:13.140,"His Majesty invites Your Highness to have lunch
in the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:22:17.640,00:22:18.710,你在外面等着,,,
00:22:19.080,00:22:20.150,本宫即刻就去,00:22:18.540,00:22:19.980,Please wait outside.
00:22:21.160,00:22:23.590,宫中菜式虽多,00:22:20.140,00:22:22.040,I will go immediately.
00:22:24.320,00:22:26.070,却不知合不合你的胃口,00:22:22.660,00:22:25.480,"Although there are a variety of dishes in the palace,"
00:22:27.280,00:22:28.470,你便多尝尝,00:22:25.500,00:22:27.500,I’m not sure what you like to eat.
00:22:28.960,00:22:30.230,若然实在不合,00:22:28.340,00:22:29.880,You can try any dish as you wish.
,,,00:22:29.960,00:22:32.100,"If they really don't cater to your taste,"
00:22:30.960,00:22:33.550,朕让华妃的小厨房做与你,00:22:32.160,00:22:34.900,I’ll order some dishes for you from Consort Fleur’s kitchen.
00:22:35.200,00:22:37.190,皇上这话臣怎么敢当呢,00:22:36.200,00:22:38.540,I do not deserve such consideration from Your Majesty.
00:22:37.680,00:22:41.230,臣能与皇上和华妃娘娘一同用膳,00:22:38.800,00:22:44.080,It is an ultimate honor to be allowed to have a meal with Your Majesty and Her Highness.
00:22:41.600,00:22:43.470,已是莫大的恩遇了,,,
00:22:43.960,00:22:44.830,你坐下,,,
00:22:45.960,00:22:47.190,一家子吃饭,00:22:44.840,00:22:46.360,Please sit.
00:22:48.000,00:22:50.070,不然动辄站起来坐下,00:22:46.980,00:22:48.920,We are having lunch as a family.
00:22:50.400,00:22:52.470,谢恩告罪还有什么趣味,00:22:49.120,00:22:53.500,"Let's not spoil the meal by standing up for every ""thank you"" and ""sorry."""
00:22:53.360,00:22:54.150,坐吧,00:22:54.240,00:22:55.340,Sit.
00:22:54.480,00:22:56.430,谢皇上 谢华妃娘娘,00:22:55.560,00:22:57.760,I thank Your Majesty and Your Highness.
00:23:02.760,00:23:06.510,这道炙羊肉鲜嫩可口,00:23:03.620,00:23:06.820,This grilled lamb is fresh and tender.
00:23:06.880,00:23:09.950,朕素日甚爱 你尝尝,00:23:08.100,00:23:11.200,It's one of my favorite dishes. You should have some.
00:23:19.680,00:23:22.750,的确美味 多谢皇上,00:23:20.620,00:23:23.880,This is delicious. I thank Your Majesty.
00:23:26.240,00:23:27.150,哥哥,,,
00:23:27.640,00:23:28.950,皇上赐宴赏菜,,,
00:23:29.560,00:23:31.470,都得由宫人伺候夹菜的,00:23:27.380,00:23:32.660,"Gengyao, you must be served by the servants
when His Majesty awards you a dish."
00:23:34.520,00:23:35.910,臣御前失礼,,,
00:23:36.160,00:23:37.470,皇上切勿怪罪,00:23:35.720,00:23:38.980,I apologize for my discourtesy before Your Majesty.
00:23:40.360,00:23:42.670,你一直在外征战,00:23:41.540,00:23:44.180,"Having gone through a succession of wars,"
00:23:43.320,00:23:46.630,自是事必躬亲不打紧,00:23:44.320,00:23:46.760,you must be accustomed to personally attending to everything.
,,,00:23:47.000,00:23:48.540,It’s all right.
00:23:47.720,00:23:50.310,臣到宫中不能不守规矩,00:23:48.820,00:23:51.820,I should obey the rules in the palace.
00:23:51.520,00:23:54.030,你自己吃着随意即可,00:23:52.600,00:23:55.060,"No, just act as you will."
00:23:54.600,00:23:57.910,规矩是提点君臣之礼,00:23:55.740,00:23:58.880,"Rules are the courtesy between monarch and subjects,"
00:23:58.360,00:24:00.230,而非约束亲戚之情,00:23:59.180,00:24:01.580,not to inhibit family members.
00:24:01.120,00:24:01.830,是,00:24:02.220,00:24:03.200,Yes.
00:24:14.880,00:24:18.070,臣面前这道燕窝鸭子好似不错,00:24:16.080,00:24:19.280,The bird's nest duck in front of me looks good.
00:24:21.000,00:24:22.470,那就有劳苏公公,00:24:21.940,00:24:24.140,May I trouble Mr Su?
00:24:53.600,00:24:55.110,大将军您慢用,00:24:54.740,00:24:57.160,"Great General, please."
00:25:00.240,00:25:03.270,你用十五日的时间,,,
00:25:04.480,00:25:06.470,一举击溃了罗卜藏丹津,00:25:01.380,00:25:07.200,You vanquished Lobsang Tendzin in just fifteen days
00:25:07.840,00:25:09.030,这八个月以来,,,
00:25:09.840,00:25:12.150,逐步地扫清残余敌军,00:25:09.040,00:25:13.160,and gradually cleaned up the remaining troops in the past eight months.
00:25:13.080,00:25:17.430,为朕安定西北威震西陲,00:25:14.180,00:25:18.360,You pacified the northwest and inspired awe in the western territories.
00:25:18.720,00:25:20.710,可算是朕的恩人,00:25:19.880,00:25:22.000,You’re a true benefactor to me.
00:25:25.600,00:25:28.190,皇上夸奖臣愧不敢当,00:25:26.480,00:25:29.520,I’m humbly undeserving of Your Majesty’s compliment.
00:25:29.440,00:25:30.750,朕即位不久,00:25:30.640,00:25:32.780,"Since I acceded to the throne not very long ago,"
00:25:31.840,00:25:34.830,朝廷内外未完全安定,00:25:33.120,00:25:36.120,stability has not been fully established in and out of the court.
00:25:35.600,00:25:38.070,朝内诸皇子蠢蠢欲动不说,00:25:36.720,00:25:39.400,"While the lords are eagerly ready for a revolt,"
00:25:38.720,00:25:39.910,边关一乱,,,
00:25:40.280,00:25:43.550,朕将腹背受敌难以顾全,00:25:39.820,00:25:43.200,"a rebelling frontier will be too overwhelming and
put me between the hammer and the anvil."
00:25:44.600,00:25:46.070,你如今的大功,,,
00:25:47.280,00:25:49.870,不但朕心倚眷嘉奖,00:25:45.800,00:25:50.700,Your extraordinary feat not only deserves my awards
00:25:50.600,00:25:56.390,朕 朕的世世子孙及天下妾民,00:25:53.420,00:26:00.320,"but also everlasting gratitude from me,
my descendants, and all the citizens."
00:25:57.160,00:25:59.390,当共倾心感悦,,,
00:26:00.360,00:26:04.270,若有负心便非朕之子孙也,00:26:01.520,00:26:05.440,None of my descendants will be allowed to be unfaithful.
00:26:04.960,00:26:08.630,若有异心便非我朝臣民,00:26:06.180,00:26:09.620,None of my citizens will be allowed to be disloyal.
00:26:10.440,00:26:12.470,华妃娘娘尽心于内,00:26:11.620,00:26:13.700,"While Her Highness Consort Fleur
dedicates herself to the harem,"
00:26:12.920,00:26:14.430,臣尽忠于外,,,
00:26:14.840,00:26:17.030,臣兄妹二人愿为皇上,00:26:13.700,00:26:16.000,I am faithfully serving Your Majesty on the borders.
00:26:17.400,00:26:20.390,尽心竭力 效犬马之劳,00:26:16.080,00:26:21.180,We humbly exert our utmost effort to serve Your Majesty.
00:26:22.760,00:26:25.390,华妃伺候朕多年,,,
00:26:26.160,00:26:28.270,一直周到细致,00:26:24.000,00:26:29.260,"Consort Fleur has been my caring and considerate
consort all these years."
00:26:30.920,00:26:35.750,你一直在外乃朕股肱之臣,00:26:31.980,00:26:36.840,And you’ve been my right-hand man on the battlefields.
00:26:36.880,00:26:39.190,朕有你这样的封疆大吏,,,
00:26:39.440,00:26:40.350,是朕的幸运,00:26:37.920,00:26:41.660,I'm fortunate to have you as the champion of the borderlands.
00:26:41.360,00:26:43.550,若是朝廷中有十来个,,,
00:26:43.840,00:26:44.790,像你这样的人,00:26:42.360,00:26:46.020,"If there were ten more officials like you,"
00:26:45.400,00:26:47.510,朕就不愁治理不好国家了,00:26:46.700,00:26:48.620,I wouldn't have to worry about governance anymore.
00:26:48.080,00:26:49.030,谢皇上,00:26:49.120,00:26:50.960,I thank Your Majesty.
00:26:51.720,00:26:55.910,这一杯朕敬你们兄妹二人,00:26:54.860,00:26:58.020,Here is to you both.
00:26:59.520,00:27:00.430,多谢皇上,00:27:00.260,00:27:01.880,I thank Your Majesty.
00:27:01.560,00:27:02.470,谢皇上,00:27:02.460,00:27:04.720,I thank Your Majesty.
00:27:09.720,00:27:10.390,是,00:27:10.740,00:27:12.160,Yes.
00:27:11.960,00:27:16.230,如今云贵甘陕一带可还平静吗,00:27:13.700,00:27:17.280,Has it been peaceful in Yun-Gui and Shaan-Gan?
00:27:17.040,00:27:17.910,一切都好,,,
00:27:19.240,00:27:20.950,只是进京之前,00:27:18.080,00:27:19.920,Everything is good.
00:27:21.920,00:27:23.830,臣已闻早卓子山一带的,00:27:20.480,00:27:22.520,"However, before I came back to Beijing,"
00:27:24.040,00:27:26.350,谢尔苏部落的番子们不太安稳,00:27:22.840,00:27:26.780,"I heard that the Xieersu tribe near
Mount Zhuozi had been rebellious."
00:27:27.000,00:27:28.230,怕会要生事,00:27:26.840,00:27:28.720,I was afraid they might riot.
00:27:29.120,00:27:31.150,果然昨日得到消息,,,
00:27:31.760,00:27:34.310,在甘肃庄浪生事,00:27:29.920,00:27:35.240,"As I expected, the news arrived yesterday that they
created a disturbance in Zhuanglang, Gansu Province."
00:27:34.680,00:27:37.230,区区番子都是乌合之众,,,
00:27:37.520,00:27:38.990,想来很快能压下去,00:27:36.880,00:27:40.340,I believe it won't take long to quell the mob.
00:27:39.560,00:27:40.830,皇上所言极是,,,
00:27:41.760,00:27:43.790,只是臣已闻早,00:27:40.700,00:27:42.700,"Certainly, Your Majesty."
00:27:44.040,00:27:45.790,谢尔苏部落密谋,,,
00:27:46.040,00:27:48.350,与新疆噶尔丹互为犄角,00:27:43.280,00:27:49.160,"However, I heard Xieersu had been conspiring with Xinjiang's Geerdan to form a resistance against our troops."
00:27:48.720,00:27:51.190,这倒不能不慎重啊,00:27:49.800,00:27:52.020,We must be cautious about that.
00:27:51.440,00:27:52.470,那你以为如何,00:27:52.420,00:27:54.120,What’s your opinion on that?
00:27:53.000,00:27:55.350,谢尔苏不过是个小部落,00:27:54.200,00:27:56.340,Xieersu is just a small tribe.
00:27:55.640,00:27:58.790,若派大将出征未免太过重视,00:27:56.520,00:28:01.120,"Sending over a high official would seem like
we are paying too much attention."
00:27:59.120,00:28:00.350,反而失了气度,,,
00:28:01.560,00:28:05.590,但若不加紧怕又会成为心腹之患,00:28:02.680,00:28:06.780,Yet an indifferent attitude would only escalate this internal hazard.
00:28:06.040,00:28:08.150,所以臣斗胆举荐,,,
00:28:08.400,00:28:10.350,臣的次子年富出征,00:28:07.040,00:28:11.060,"Hence I would make a bold suggestion to send
my second son Nian Fu to quell the unrest."
00:28:10.600,00:28:13.110,他虽处轻却也历练过,00:28:11.680,00:28:14.080,He is quite experienced despite his age.
00:28:13.480,00:28:15.190,臣想放他一试,00:28:14.540,00:28:16.600,I would like for him to have an opportunity like this.
00:28:17.680,00:28:19.950,皇上 臣妾不能干政,00:28:18.840,00:28:21.060,"Your Majesty, I'm not allowed to interfere in governance."
00:28:20.680,00:28:24.190,不宜在此听皇上跟哥哥讨论国事,,,
00:28:25.480,00:28:27.070,朕与你哥哥谈的,,,
00:28:27.360,00:28:30.910,既是国事也是家事倒也无妨,00:28:26.560,00:28:30.700,This is both state affairs and family matters.
00:28:32.360,00:28:33.790,华妃说得对啊,00:28:31.020,00:28:32.880,It's fine if you stay.
,,,00:28:33.540,00:28:35.520,Consort Fleur is right.
00:28:34.160,00:28:37.550,臣难得与皇上一桌用餐,00:28:35.760,00:28:38.700,It's an exceptional honor to dine with Your Majesty.
00:28:38.360,00:28:41.070,一家子团聚是不该议论其他,00:28:39.580,00:28:43.040,I shouldn't have been talking about work at a family reunion.
00:28:50.960,00:28:54.590,好那咱们就专心吃饭,00:28:52.040,00:28:53.560,Very well then.
,,,00:28:53.700,00:28:56.140,Let's keep eating.
00:28:59.600,00:29:00.670,天气寒冷,,,
00:29:01.000,00:29:02.350,宫中十月十五起,00:29:00.540,00:29:02.160,The weather is getting cold.
00:29:02.600,00:29:04.190,每顿饭都会添锅子,00:29:02.160,00:29:05.040,"We will have hot pot for every meal
starting from the15th of October."
00:29:05.480,00:29:06.750,为着今儿哥哥来,,,
00:29:07.040,00:29:07.950,虽是十四,,,
00:29:08.200,00:29:09.630,皇上还是命御膳房,00:29:06.460,00:29:12.160,"Although it's the 14th today, His Majesty ordered the
Imperial Kitchen to prepare this assorted hot pot for you."
00:29:09.920,00:29:11.470,准备了这道什锦锅子,,,
00:29:11.960,00:29:15.750,哥哥的一饮一食必得念及皇恩哪,00:29:12.780,00:29:16.920,You must be grateful for His Majesty's thought in your meal.
00:29:17.120,00:29:18.510,谢皇上圣恩,00:29:18.040,00:29:20.560,I thank Your Majesty for the heavenly grace.
00:29:20.760,00:29:23.510,锅子吃了身上暖和,00:29:21.820,00:29:24.860,Sharing the same hot pot will keep us warm
00:29:25.320,00:29:27.910,你与朕君臣一心,,,
00:29:29.160,00:29:31.270,朕这心里更暖和,00:29:26.540,00:29:32.160,while sharing the same mind makes me even warmer.
00:29:32.360,00:29:33.030,是,,,
00:29:33.960,00:29:34.630,快吃,00:29:33.420,00:29:34.720,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:29:35.520,00:29:36.310,是,00:29:35.000,00:29:36.060,Help yourself.
,,,00:29:36.620,00:29:37.780,Yes.
00:29:42.120,00:29:43.750,奴才恭送华妃娘娘,00:29:43.040,00:29:45.040,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:29:44.800,00:29:46.030,恭送年大将军,00:29:45.740,00:29:47.740,I bid Great General Nian goodbye.
00:29:50.160,00:29:51.230,哥哥呀哥哥,00:29:51.040,00:29:52.340,"Oh my, Gengyao,"
00:29:51.600,00:29:53.950,这顿饭吃得妹妹我是提心吊胆的,00:29:52.500,00:29:55.360,I had my heart in my mouth during the entire meal.
00:29:55.800,00:29:57.030,你这是怎么了,00:29:56.900,00:29:58.480,What’s going on with you?
00:29:57.680,00:29:59.910,那道炙羊肉皇上说他喜欢吃,00:29:58.640,00:30:01.060,When His Majesty said the grilled lamb was his favorite.
00:30:00.120,00:30:01.230,皇上都还没动筷子,,,
00:30:01.600,00:30:02.710,你怎么就先动筷子了呢,00:30:01.220,00:30:03.840,How could you eat it before His Majesty even lifted his chopsticks?
00:30:03.280,00:30:04.430,这倒也罢了,,,
00:30:04.680,00:30:06.310,你还让苏培盛给你夹菜,00:30:04.100,00:30:07.700,"More than that, how could you ask Su Peisheng to serve it to you?"
00:30:06.720,00:30:08.030,苏培盛是什么人哪,00:30:07.860,00:30:09.500,Do you not know who Su Peisheng is?
00:30:08.320,00:30:10.750,那是皇上用了几十年的老太监了,00:30:09.580,00:30:11.740,"He has been the direct servant of His Majesty for decades,"
00:30:11.080,00:30:12.310,打小就跟着皇上,,,
00:30:12.640,00:30:13.870,你还敢使唤他呢,00:30:11.920,00:30:13.600,ever since His Majesty was young.
,,,00:30:13.600,00:30:15.500,How could you order him around?
00:30:15.880,00:30:17.710,我的脾气你不是不晓得,00:30:16.740,00:30:18.800,You know me.
00:30:18.040,00:30:20.350,我最讨厌这些阉人的臭气,00:30:19.080,00:30:21.480,I hate the foul stench of eunuchs.
00:30:21.640,00:30:25.150,既是皇宫里的规矩我不得不遵,00:30:22.760,00:30:26.320,"When I had to obey the rules of the palace,"
00:30:25.480,00:30:26.350,我当然要找那个,,,
00:30:26.680,00:30:28.790,最有头脸的阉人来伺候,00:30:26.600,00:30:29.940,"I would want the ""head and face"" of the eunuchs to serve me."
00:30:29.880,00:30:31.270,说句不中早的话,,,
00:30:31.840,00:30:33.470,我从沙场征战回来,00:30:30.920,00:30:32.940,"If i may say so,"
00:30:33.800,00:30:34.870,立下汗马功劳,,,
00:30:35.360,00:30:37.270,还不能让一个阉人伺候,00:30:33.000,00:30:38.260,"do the wars I won on my horseback
not deserve the service of a eunuch?"
00:30:38.920,00:30:41.110,他伺候皇上也伺候我,00:30:39.660,00:30:42.620,He is the servant of His Majesty and me.
00:30:41.800,00:30:44.830,既然如此伺候哥哥一次也无妨,00:30:42.680,00:30:45.640,It's fine that he serves you one single time.
00:30:45.560,00:30:46.830,以后可不能这样了,,,
00:30:48.840,00:30:50.910,李白那点臭墨子文采,00:30:46.540,00:30:48.740,But don't do that again.
00:30:51.240,00:30:52.550,还让高力士脱靴呢,00:30:49.600,00:30:53.960,"Li Bai, with his stinky poems, could even have Gao Lishi
[the highest eunuch at that time] remove his boots for him."
00:30:52.840,00:30:56.110,他苏培盛能伺候我是他的福气,00:30:54.000,00:30:57.240,It was Su Peisheng's honor to serve for me.
00:30:56.800,00:31:00.230,还有呢 有些话皇上说得,00:30:57.680,00:31:02.420,"Other than that, there are things that His Majesty can say but you can't."
00:31:00.520,00:31:01.710,哥哥你就说不得了,00:31:02.500,00:31:03.320,Mm?
00:31:02.520,00:31:04.550,皇上说一家人那是客套,00:31:03.320,00:31:05.920,His Majesty was being polite when he said we are a family.
00:31:05.160,00:31:07.270,哥哥说一家人就是僭越了,00:31:06.040,00:31:08.780,But your saying that oversteps the bounds of propriety.
00:31:07.880,00:31:08.870,哥哥你又还没喝酒,,,
00:31:09.160,00:31:10.390,怎么就先醉了呢,00:31:08.900,00:31:10.109,Why were you acrting
00:31:12.600,00:31:13.870,我说妹妹你啊,00:31:10.109,00:31:11.500,drunk before you drank?
00:31:14.120,00:31:15.430,是不是在宫里待久啊,,,
00:31:15.840,00:31:16.950,这心眼也小起来,00:31:13.680,00:31:18.000,"Shilan, it seems that living in the palace has narrowed your mind."
00:31:17.400,00:31:19.790,我不过是顺着皇上顺口说一句,00:31:18.440,00:31:21.180,I was just echoing His Majesty's words.
00:31:20.400,00:31:23.190,何况皇上和咱们是一家子,00:31:21.380,00:31:24.280,"And in fact, His Majesty is our family."
00:31:23.920,00:31:25.430,你是皇上的爱妃,,,
00:31:25.680,00:31:26.830,我是皇上的大舅子,00:31:24.920,00:31:27.720,You are his beloved consort and I am his brother-in-law.
00:31:27.320,00:31:29.070,可不是至亲骨肉吗,00:31:28.040,00:31:29.980,Are we not kin to him?
00:31:29.320,00:31:32.190,阿弥陀佛 还好皇上没有怪罪,00:31:30.220,00:31:33.800,"Thanks to Buddha, His Majesty didn't blame you."
00:31:32.680,00:31:35.030,还让你送我回宫再回去面圣,00:31:33.900,00:31:36.440,His Majesty even let you walk me back to my palace.
00:31:35.800,00:31:37.590,想来是没有生气吧,00:31:36.440,00:31:38.440,I reckon he's not angry.
00:31:40.760,00:31:41.950,你这是怎么了,00:31:41.700,00:31:43.600,What's wrong with you?
00:31:43.000,00:31:45.830,是不是那皇后给你气受了,00:31:43.960,00:31:47.160,Is it the Empress who's been giving you trouble?
00:31:47.480,00:31:49.630,皇后哪成得了那种气候,00:31:48.260,00:31:50.700,She's not capable of that.
00:31:50.640,00:31:54.390,倒是皇上新得的莞贵人抓尖卖乖,00:31:51.680,00:31:53.400,It's the new concubine Lady Sourire.
00:31:55.280,00:31:57.430,挑拨离间专和我过不去,00:31:53.840,00:31:58.100,"She always fawns over His Majesty
and turns His Majesty against me."
00:31:58.360,00:31:59.310,就是因为她,,,
00:31:59.880,00:32:01.750,皇上削了我协理六宫之权,00:31:59.400,00:32:04.380,"It was because of her that His Majesty suspended
my authority in palace management to this day."
00:32:02.280,00:32:03.510,至今都没恢复,,,
00:32:04.440,00:32:07.390,一个小小的贵人竟敢犯上,00:32:05.380,00:32:08.620,How dare a Noble Lady offend you as her superior?
00:32:08.320,00:32:10.870,皇上宠着她我又能怎么样,00:32:09.400,00:32:10.860,She is in high favor.
,,,00:32:10.920,00:32:12.420,What can I do?
00:32:13.320,00:32:16.150,早说她的父亲也在朝为官,00:32:14.420,00:32:17.700,I heard that her father is a deputy minister.
00:32:18.120,00:32:18.990,叫什么名字,00:32:17.980,00:32:20.200,Oh? What's his name?
00:32:19.800,00:32:20.710,甄远道,00:32:20.800,00:32:22.560,Zhen Yuandao.
00:32:23.000,00:32:23.990,好啊,00:32:23.380,00:32:25.100,Very well.
00:32:24.680,00:32:26.430,他的女儿和你过不去,00:32:25.640,00:32:27.780,"Since his daughter is giving you trouble,"
00:32:27.040,00:32:28.630,我便和他过不去,00:32:27.960,00:32:29.840,I will get him in trouble!
00:32:30.320,00:32:32.150,好在哥哥还护着我,00:32:31.100,00:32:33.600,I am fortunate to have your support.
00:32:33.040,00:32:35.670,不然 不然我得受多少委屈啊,00:32:34.100,00:32:37.140,"Otherwise, my life would be much more miserable!"
00:32:37.840,00:32:40.150,有哥哥在你怕什么,00:32:38.640,00:32:41.900,"Don't worry, I got your back."
00:32:45.720,00:32:47.430,皇上年将军回来了,00:32:46.700,00:32:49.060,"Your Majesty, General Nian is back."
00:32:49.120,00:32:49.830,皇上,00:32:50.220,00:32:51.720,Your Majesty.
00:32:53.240,00:32:53.910,快坐,00:32:54.160,00:32:56.160,Have a seat.
00:32:58.640,00:33:01.190,臣恭敬不如从命,00:32:59.140,00:33:02.460,I'm honored to obey.
00:33:06.680,00:33:08.070,大将军请用茶,00:33:07.740,00:33:10.860,"General Nian, please have a cup of tea."
00:33:13.040,00:33:13.710,皇上,,,
00:33:14.680,00:33:18.510,臣上次参奏直隶巡抚赵之垣,00:33:14.000,00:33:19.140,"I previously denounced to Your Majesty Zhao Zhiyuan,
the Governor of Zhi Li."
00:33:18.960,00:33:21.830,庸劣纨绔不能担当巡抚重任,00:33:19.580,00:33:22.760,He should not occupy this position for his foppery and mediocracy.
00:33:22.160,00:33:24.270,不知圣意如何裁决,00:33:23.080,00:33:25.320,I wonder if Your Majesty has adjudicated yet.
00:33:24.680,00:33:26.270,你既觉得他不可用,,,
00:33:27.200,00:33:29.950,朕便下旨将他革除就是,00:33:25.840,00:33:30.660,"If you think he is unqualified, I will dismiss him."
00:33:31.240,00:33:32.310,皇上圣明,00:33:32.380,00:33:34.440,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:33:34.920,00:33:41.390,你与朕在外是君臣在内是亲戚,00:33:36.000,00:33:42.380,"Although we are monarch and subject in public,
we are family at home."
00:33:42.520,00:33:44.630,朕若不做个出色的皇帝,,,
00:33:45.760,00:33:47.910,便不能酬赏你待朕之心,00:33:43.480,00:33:48.780,I must be an excellent emperor to honor your hard work.
00:33:48.760,00:33:49.230,是,00:33:49.760,00:33:50.480,Yes.
00:33:49.440,00:33:51.910,你若是不做个超群的大臣,,,
00:33:52.840,00:33:55.990,便不能报答朕对你的知遇之恩,00:33:50.480,00:33:56.720,And you must be an outstanding general to reciprocate my appreciation.
00:33:57.040,00:33:59.630,你我君妾定要做一对,,,
00:34:00.040,00:34:02.070,千古榜样人物才好啊,00:33:57.940,00:34:03.200,We must leave a good name through generations.
00:34:03.360,00:34:06.270,臣必当粉身碎骨,,,
00:34:06.520,00:34:09.310,万死以报皇上的恩泽,00:34:04.160,00:34:10.680,"I will not hesitate to sacrifice my life
in reciprocation for Your Majesty's grace."
00:34:11.000,00:34:12.430,你便坐好吧,,,
00:34:13.600,00:34:15.070,动不动就谢恩,00:34:12.100,00:34:14.300,Just sit there and make yourself comfortable.
00:34:15.720,00:34:17.230,朕早着都累,00:34:14.500,00:34:18.160,I am tired of you frequently standing up to thank me.
00:34:17.640,00:34:18.510,臣遵旨,00:34:18.760,00:34:20.100,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:34:19.560,00:34:23.310,朕感你劳苦功高,00:34:20.880,00:34:25.980,"For your commitment and contributions, I reward you"
00:34:24.160,00:34:26.990,特赐你双眼孔雀翎,,,
00:34:27.480,00:34:28.950,四团龙补服,00:34:25.980,00:34:28.560,"a two-ocellus peacock feather
[a symbol of distinction worn on hat],"
00:34:29.520,00:34:31.430,黄带紫辔黄金千两,00:34:28.620,00:34:30.560," a patching dress with four dragon medallions,"
00:34:35.440,00:34:37.230,你今日也累了,00:34:30.560,00:34:33.560,"a yellow belt, a purple halter and lead, and 1000 taels of gold."
00:34:37.640,00:34:39.470,先回府邸好好歇息,00:34:36.640,00:34:38.720,You've had a long day.
00:34:39.840,00:34:40.910,改日再来回话,00:34:38.800,00:34:40.720,You should go back for a good rest.
,,,00:34:40.820,00:34:42.320,Get back to me another day.
00:34:43.640,00:34:47.550,臣叩谢圣恩,00:34:44.900,00:34:49.600,I humbly thank Your Majesty.
00:35:03.840,00:35:04.510,娘娘,,,
00:35:04.800,00:35:06.190,小厦子听得真真儿的,,,
00:35:06.800,00:35:09.150,皇上称年大将军为恩人,00:35:06.060,00:35:10.160,"Xiao-Xiazi heard it clearly ...
that His Majesty called General Nian his ""benefactor ""."
00:35:11.720,00:35:12.510,娘娘,00:35:12.740,00:35:14.540,Your Majesty.
00:35:15.880,00:35:16.830,剪秋啊,,,
00:35:18.280,00:35:21.790,这天怎么就这么冷下来了呢,00:35:16.860,00:35:22.120,"Autumn, why is it getting cold all of a sudden?"
00:35:22.280,00:35:23.870,西北风起了是有些冷,00:35:23.140,00:35:25.100,Because of the wind from the northwest.
00:35:24.160,00:35:25.950,要不奴婢给您添件衣裳吧,00:35:25.220,00:35:27.220,Shall I bring Your Majesty a coat?
00:35:26.680,00:35:30.910,天冷了衣裳穿得多又有什么用啊,00:35:27.960,00:35:31.660,A coat will not change the weather.
00:35:32.960,00:35:34.990,这些日子皇上凡进后宫,,,
00:35:35.360,00:35:36.510,都是去华妃那儿,00:35:33.700,00:35:37.620,His Majesty has only been visiting Consort Fleur.
00:35:37.440,00:35:39.750,连景仁宫的门槛半步也没踏进过,00:35:38.500,00:35:40.900,He didn’t even step into the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:35:40.520,00:35:43.790,这景仁宫一直都是冷的,00:35:41.440,00:35:45.100,The Palace of Great Benevolence has always been cold.
00:35:44.680,00:35:47.150,皇上来一回才暖一回,00:35:45.700,00:35:48.240,It warmed up once in a while when His Majesty visited.
00:35:48.440,00:35:51.870,可现在真的变冷了,00:35:49.440,00:35:53.240,"But now, it has truly turned cold."
00:35:53.400,00:35:56.310,什么时候皇上想起报恩,,,
00:35:57.200,00:36:00.070,把这景仁宫也给华妃了,00:35:54.420,00:36:00.600,I wonder how warm the Palace of Great Benevolence would be ...
00:36:01.360,00:36:05.630,那这景仁宫才算是真的暖和透了,00:36:02.380,00:36:06.260,"if His Majesty gave it as a gift to his ""benefactor""."
00:36:10.480,00:36:12.430,皇上近日总陪着臣妾,,,
00:36:13.320,00:36:14.990,也不去看看其他的姐妹,00:36:11.480,00:36:16.220,"Your Majesty has only been staying with me lately.
You should visit the other concubines as well."
00:36:17.240,00:36:18.870,既然华妃贤德,,,
00:36:20.080,00:36:22.790,那朕就去看看齐妃她们,00:36:18.080,00:36:23.580,"If you say so, I’ll go visit Consort Astuce."
00:36:23.920,00:36:24.950,皇上,,,
00:36:25.600,00:36:27.030,臣妾不过一问,00:36:25.080,00:36:26.500,Your Majesty!
00:36:27.560,00:36:28.910,外面夜深露重,00:36:26.840,00:36:28.300,You know I didn't mean it.
00:36:29.440,00:36:30.750,皇上不宜出行,00:36:28.480,00:36:29.900,It’s late now.
00:36:31.320,00:36:32.950,朕就知道你舍不得,00:36:30.440,00:36:31.960,Your Majesty should stay.
00:36:35.200,00:36:38.430,记得你刚入王府的时候,00:36:32.240,00:36:34.360,I knew you wouldn't let me.
00:36:39.480,00:36:41.030,朕也总是陪着你,00:36:36.160,00:36:42.120,I remember I always stayed with you when we were newly married.
00:36:42.440,00:36:44.870,有时候都冷落了,,,
00:36:45.240,00:36:46.950,刚成为福晋的宜修呢,00:36:43.380,00:36:48.120,"Sometimes I would have neglected Yixiu [the empress],
even when she had just become my primary wife."
00:36:48.840,00:36:50.110,臣妾入王府前,,,
00:36:50.440,00:36:52.550,皇上陪皇后的日子多多了,00:36:49.980,00:36:53.540,"Before I married into the family, Your Majesty
had spent many nights with Her Majesty."
00:36:53.320,00:36:54.910,皇后入王府早,,,
00:36:55.560,00:36:57.110,皇上多匀一些时间,00:36:54.220,00:36:56.340,Her Majesty married into the family earlier than me.
00:36:57.400,00:36:59.670,陪臣妾才公平嘛,00:36:56.360,00:37:00.380,Your Majesty will make it fair by spending more time with me.
00:37:00.000,00:37:02.990,朕何尝不想多陪陪你,00:37:01.060,00:37:04.340,I wish I could.
00:37:04.800,00:37:07.070,可朕如今是一国之君,00:37:05.380,00:37:07.940,"But as the emperor,"
00:37:08.440,00:37:10.190,有前朝的事要忙,00:37:09.220,00:37:11.540,I have to manage the state affairs
00:37:11.000,00:37:12.390,后宫的人也多了,00:37:12.040,00:37:14.040,and a harem with more concubines.
00:37:12.960,00:37:16.030,总不能为了你就都冷落了吧,00:37:14.140,00:37:17.040,I can’t neglect them all just for you.
00:37:17.960,00:37:19.150,皇上这么说,,,
00:37:20.000,00:37:23.510,便是陪臣妾的时候还想着旁人了,00:37:18.800,00:37:24.140,"If Your Majesty says so, Your Majesty must be
thinking of someone else when you're with me."
00:37:25.200,00:37:29.150,你这话就是在跟朕赌气了,00:37:26.180,00:37:30.340,Don’t be temperamental.
00:37:30.680,00:37:33.110,从前在王府你是侧福晋,,,
00:37:34.000,00:37:35.190,如今是妃子,00:37:31.840,00:37:36.340,"You were a Lord Consort [secondary wife of a lord]
and now a Consort."
00:37:36.320,00:37:38.150,宫里人多事杂,,,
00:37:38.880,00:37:41.150,你要放宽了心 替朕照应,00:37:37.460,00:37:41.960,"I need you to dedicate your mind to the
people and things in the palace for me."
,,,00:37:43.340,00:37:44.400,Okay?
00:37:44.000,00:37:47.350,皇后身子不行 你要多担待啊,00:37:44.920,00:37:48.100,"The empress is in ill health.
You must carry some of the burden for her."
00:37:48.880,00:37:50.230,臣妾知道了,00:37:49.940,00:37:51.880,"Yes, I understand."
00:37:57.920,00:37:59.150,姐姐可真有情致,,,
00:37:59.720,00:38:01.230,研制这百和香的制法,00:37:58.760,00:38:03.100,"Sourire, you are really keen on making the Harmony Perfume.
You've been working on it for more than a week."
00:38:01.520,00:38:03.110,已有七八日了竟也不倦,00:38:03.360,00:38:05.320,How come you are not tired of it?
00:38:04.960,00:38:08.750,长夜寂寂 总要寻些事情来打发,00:38:05.880,00:38:09.640,I need to do something to pass the long and lonely nights.
00:38:10.160,00:38:11.710,皇上也没来看姐姐吗,00:38:11.000,00:38:13.400,Hasn’t His Majesty visited you?
00:38:13.680,00:38:15.190,六日前来用过午膳,,,
00:38:15.960,00:38:17.030,便没再来过,00:38:14.400,00:38:17.800,Not since he was here for lunch six days ago.
00:38:18.840,00:38:20.190,姐姐记得好清楚,00:38:19.820,00:38:21.820,You remember the days so well.
00:38:21.240,00:38:22.870,我都已经记不得日子了,00:38:22.320,00:38:24.520,I can't even recall when was the last time.
00:38:23.920,00:38:26.150,大约有半个多月了吧,00:38:24.940,00:38:27.140,It's probably been more than half a month.
00:38:28.160,00:38:29.390,不过也抱怨不得,,,
00:38:29.760,00:38:30.950,听齐妃娘娘说,00:38:29.100,00:38:30.600,But I can't complain.
00:38:31.280,00:38:33.550,她自打回宫就没见过皇上,00:38:30.940,00:38:34.240,"Consort Astuce said she had not seen His Majesty
since she came back to the palace."
00:38:35.800,00:38:37.270,秋来百花杀尽,00:38:36.800,00:38:38.500,The cold autumn killed all the flowers
00:38:37.560,00:38:39.030,唯有华妃一枝独秀,00:38:38.540,00:38:40.540,except for Consort Fleur.
00:38:40.440,00:38:42.710,她乐她的 咱们且乐咱们的,00:38:41.540,00:38:44.580,"While she can take pleasure in seeing all the
""bare branches"", we fend for ourselves."
00:38:47.440,00:38:48.670,妹妹身子不适吗,00:38:48.200,00:38:50.560,Are you not feeling well?
00:38:50.240,00:38:52.750,早上偶遇风寒养两日便好了,00:38:51.180,00:38:54.100,"I caught a cold this morning.
I will be fine after a day or two."
00:38:53.160,00:38:53.950,无妨,00:38:54.240,00:38:55.340,Don't worry.
00:38:55.760,00:38:58.950,其实这百和香的制法已经失散了,00:38:56.500,00:38:59.940,"Actually, the recipe for the Harmony Perfume is lost."
00:38:59.320,00:39:01.030,现在在宫中也很少见,00:39:00.440,00:39:02.440,It is rarely seen even in the palace.
00:39:01.840,00:39:02.990,什么都是现成的,,,
00:39:03.240,00:39:04.190,又有什么趣儿,00:39:03.000,00:39:05.260,There's no fun if everything is cut and dried.
00:39:04.440,00:39:06.630,既要打发时间就得自己来制,00:39:05.460,00:39:07.720,Experimenting with the spices is an enjoyable pastime.
00:39:07.200,00:39:08.990,且这百和香要是能做出来,,,
00:39:09.640,00:39:11.150,冬日里用是最好的,00:39:08.280,00:39:12.240,"It would be great to use the
Harmony Perfume in winter if we are successful."
00:39:12.040,00:39:13.550,若有暖炉的热气一烘,,,
00:39:13.800,00:39:15.150,便有置身花海之感,00:39:13.000,00:39:16.460,"It would bring you to a sea of flowers
when roasted by the stove heater."
00:39:15.840,00:39:19.150,是 幸而我父亲在为官前,,,
00:39:19.400,00:39:20.910,做过十多年的香料生意,00:39:17.100,00:39:21.700,"Exactly. My father used to own a spice business
for over 10 years before he had a public office."
00:39:21.200,00:39:23.110,也得了许多炮制薰香的秘方,00:39:22.160,00:39:24.320,He got lots of secret recipes for incense by luck.
00:39:23.640,00:39:25.030,我在家揣摩了几日,00:39:24.660,00:39:26.340,I studied them for a few days
00:39:25.520,00:39:27.750,终于想到有几味香料能用得到,00:39:26.500,00:39:28.900,and found several ingredients that might be useful.
00:39:27.960,00:39:29.670,好啊 你来说我来写,00:39:29.620,00:39:31.800,That's great! I will write them down.
00:39:32.000,00:39:34.070,皇上一直喜欢听安常在唱歌,00:39:32.960,00:39:35.140,Your Majesty always likes to hear Attendant An singing.
00:39:34.720,00:39:36.710,这也有些日子没早她唱了,00:39:35.500,00:39:37.500,It's been a while.
00:39:37.600,00:39:40.270,不如请她过来清歌一曲,00:39:38.680,00:39:41.360,How about we have her over to sing for Your Majesty?
00:39:41.040,00:39:44.790,臣妾也好和皇上同乐一回啊,00:39:42.040,00:39:45.500,It would be a great pleasure for me as well.
00:39:45.120,00:39:47.710,夜深了何苦叫人走一趟,00:39:46.000,00:39:49.140,It's already late. It would be too much trouble for her.
00:39:48.720,00:39:49.750,皇上,00:39:49.820,00:39:51.060,Your Majesty ...
00:39:52.640,00:39:55.310,不过你喜欢叫她来便是,00:39:53.680,00:39:56.360,It's all right if you'd like.
00:39:58.960,00:39:59.910,周宁海,,,
00:40:00.800,00:40:01.470,嗻,00:40:00.040,00:40:01.140,Zhou Ninghai.
00:40:02.880,00:40:03.710,去请,00:40:01.480,00:40:02.960,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:40:04.000,00:40:04.670,嗻,00:40:03.660,00:40:04.940,Request for her to come.
,,,00:40:05.000,00:40:05.500,Yes.
00:40:15.920,00:40:18.190,姐姐的心事全都写在上头了,00:40:16.500,00:40:18.960,"Sourire, I can read your mind from your writing."
00:40:18.440,00:40:19.110,怎么了,00:40:19.260,00:40:20.500,What's wrong?
00:40:19.680,00:40:23.750,姐姐博学 怎么连藿香的藿字,00:40:20.720,00:40:26.380,"In your erudite mind, is the 藿 character written this way?"
00:40:24.280,00:40:25.190,都写借了,,,
00:40:26.040,00:40:27.230,草头去了哪里啊,,,
00:40:27.800,00:40:29.390,姐姐的心跟着皇上走了,00:40:26.960,00:40:28.960,Where is the 艹 radical on top?
00:40:29.840,00:40:31.150,连草头也飞走了,00:40:29.120,00:40:32.360,Did it fly with your heart to His Majesty?
