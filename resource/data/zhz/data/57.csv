00:02:22.100,00:02:23.050,娘娘回来了,,,
00:02:23.930,00:02:25.010,方才皇上来过了,00:02:22.934,00:02:24.150,Your Highness is back.
00:02:25.350,00:02:27.140,听说娘娘去了太后那边请安,00:02:24.808,00:02:26.184,His Majesty stopped by just now;
00:02:27.390,00:02:28.430,说晚上再过来,00:02:26.184,00:02:28.227,"since you were paying respects to Her Majesty,"
00:02:29.310,00:02:30.020,知道了,00:02:28.227,00:02:29.807,he said he would come back tonight.
00:02:30.230,00:02:31.090,方才受了惊吓,00:02:30.000,00:02:31.000,I see.
00:02:31.440,00:02:33.300,还是叫温太医来瞧一瞧吧,00:02:31.108,00:02:32.160,You just had a scare.
00:02:33.570,00:02:34.300,也好安心,00:02:32.274,00:02:34.413,Better to send for Dr. Wen to check on you
00:02:35.110,00:02:35.770,我没事,00:02:34.413,00:02:35.800,to put your mind at peace.
00:02:36.530,00:02:37.610,这是出了什么事了,00:02:35.800,00:02:36.800,I'm fine.
,,,00:02:37.480,00:02:38.488,What happened?
00:02:37.940,00:02:39.650,二位娘娘脸色都这么不好,00:02:38.880,00:02:40.590,Both of Your Highnesses look upset.
00:02:40.030,00:02:41.570,有人耐不住性子了,00:02:41.000,00:02:42.440,Someone is impatient.
00:02:41.780,00:02:43.900,在回宫的路上掺了鹅卵石,00:02:42.920,00:02:44.937,Loose pebbles were scattered on the road back.
00:02:44.160,00:02:46.620,害得轿夫滑脚 差点摔了嬛儿,00:02:45.200,00:02:47.440,The sedan carriers slipped and Huan'er almost fell off.
00:02:47.500,00:02:48.530,那个轿辇那么高,,,
00:02:48.830,00:02:49.990,要是真的摔下来了,00:02:48.520,00:02:49.777,The sedan was rather high.
00:02:50.420,00:02:51.950,孩子一定会保不住的,00:02:49.777,00:02:51.289,"If Huan'er did fall,"
00:02:52.170,00:02:52.780,没事吧,00:02:51.289,00:02:52.880,she would have lost her child.
00:02:53.750,00:02:54.330,没事,00:02:53.000,00:02:54.000,Is Your Highness all right?
00:02:55.590,00:02:56.830,这宫中的铺路的石子,00:02:54.600,00:02:55.600,I am.
00:02:57.170,00:02:58.630,可是一个一个精心挑过的,00:02:56.424,00:02:59.520,"The stones used for pavement in the palace
were selected carefully."
00:02:59.220,00:03:00.710,不可能掺进去鹅卵石啊,00:03:00.120,00:03:01.600,There shouldn't be any loose pebbles.
00:03:02.260,00:03:03.500,一定是有人存心,00:03:03.360,00:03:04.807,Someone must have done this on purpose.
00:03:05.140,00:03:06.970,说到是哪位做下的事,00:03:06.240,00:03:07.966,"As to the person responsible,"
00:03:07.350,00:03:09.680,可不是景仁宫那位首当其冲吗,00:03:08.160,00:03:10.800,"the one residing in the Palace of Great Benevolence
should surely be our first guess."
00:03:10.140,00:03:12.680,除了她心思最重 还能有谁,00:03:11.320,00:03:13.720,Who else could be more scheming than she is?
00:03:13.860,00:03:14.940,若说为了皇嗣,,,
00:03:15.270,00:03:16.600,她自然最有这心思,00:03:14.916,00:03:16.161,She is most eager
00:03:17.440,00:03:18.810,可旁人也未必没有,00:03:16.161,00:03:17.520,to eliminate other imperial heirs.
00:03:19.900,00:03:20.520,有了第一次,00:03:18.318,00:03:19.840,Yet so are the concubines.
00:03:20.740,00:03:22.190,便会有第二次 第三次,00:03:21.000,00:03:23.120,This will not be their last attempt.
00:03:22.700,00:03:24.230,只要娘娘的身孕还在,00:03:23.760,00:03:25.420,Throughout Your Highness's pregnancy
00:03:24.570,00:03:26.110,她们就不会善罢甘休的,00:03:25.420,00:03:27.080,they will not give up easily.
00:03:26.990,00:03:28.150,不是咱们再三防范,,,
00:03:28.410,00:03:29.570,就可以防范得了的,00:03:27.920,00:03:30.480,Taking precautions is not enough to protect us.
00:03:30.620,00:03:32.860,娘娘既然晚上皇上要过来,00:03:31.680,00:03:32.680,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:03:32.680,00:03:34.105,"since His Majesty is coming tonight,"
00:03:33.420,00:03:35.950,您务必要把此事告诉皇上才好啊,00:03:34.440,00:03:37.000,you ought to tell him about the incident.
00:03:37.050,00:03:37.580,小允子,,,
00:03:37.880,00:03:38.460,在,00:03:38.000,00:03:38.920,Xiao-Yunzi.
00:03:38.670,00:03:39.830,你方才捡的鹅卵石呢,00:03:38.920,00:03:39.680,Yes.
00:03:40.050,00:03:40.630,在这儿,00:03:39.680,00:03:40.800,Where are the pebbles you picked up?
,,,00:03:41.000,00:03:42.000,Here they are.
00:03:43.140,00:03:45.050,你去花房找个靠得住的人,00:03:44.240,00:03:46.150,Find someone reliable in the greenhouse
00:03:45.850,00:03:46.680,叫他仔细看看,,,
00:03:46.970,00:03:48.630,这鹅卵石上的青苔有什么古怪,00:03:46.760,00:03:49.454,to examine the lichen on the pebbles.
00:03:49.020,00:03:49.670,嘛,00:03:49.920,00:03:50.920,Yes.
00:03:49.980,00:03:52.340,我看着不像是寻常的青苔,00:03:51.000,00:03:53.440,The lichen doesn't seem ordinary to me.
00:03:53.440,00:03:53.930,嘛,00:03:54.480,00:03:55.480,Yes.
00:03:58.150,00:03:58.940,不管是谁,00:03:59.040,00:04:00.351,Whoever it was -
00:03:59.990,00:04:03.150,既做得出来 就别怪我容不下她,00:04:01.000,00:04:04.320,there will be consequences for what she did.
00:04:03.780,00:04:05.570,皇上驾到,00:04:04.614,00:04:06.404,His Majesty the Emperor!
00:04:18.250,00:04:19.410,皇上万福金安,00:04:19.240,00:04:20.510,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:04:20.210,00:04:22.960,皇上 今日我们娘娘身子不爽,00:04:21.240,00:04:22.240,"Your Majesty,"
00:04:23.510,00:04:24.590,正在寝殿睡着,00:04:22.480,00:04:25.480,"Her Highness is indisposed today
and is sleeping in the bedchamber."
00:04:24.840,00:04:26.000,叫太医瞧了没有,00:04:25.800,00:04:27.120,Have you sent for a doctor to check on her?
00:04:26.510,00:04:27.880,怎么不早些来告诉朕,00:04:27.560,00:04:28.960,You should have informed me earlier.
00:04:35.350,00:04:37.060,怎么不舒服 脸色这样难看,00:04:36.320,00:04:38.240,What seems to be the problem? You look unwell.
00:04:37.480,00:04:40.600,皇上皇上,00:04:38.480,00:04:39.480,Your Majesty!
,,,00:04:41.000,00:04:42.000,Your Majesty!
00:04:41.490,00:04:43.190,就这样抱着臣妾好不好,00:04:42.400,00:04:44.280,"Just hold me like this, please."
00:04:45.660,00:04:46.190,洗碧,00:04:46.680,00:04:47.680,Jade.
00:04:47.490,00:04:48.230,奴婢在,00:04:48.400,00:04:49.400,Your Majesty.
00:04:48.490,00:04:50.320,你是熹妃的陪嫁 你来说,00:04:49.400,00:04:50.805,You're Consort Lumière's dowry maid.
,,,00:04:50.805,00:04:51.800,Tell me what happened.
00:04:51.660,00:04:53.490,你只管说 没人敢责备你,00:04:52.716,00:04:53.729,Speak the truth.
,,,00:04:53.729,00:04:54.800,No one will blame you.
00:04:56.710,00:04:57.320,皇上,00:04:57.810,00:04:58.800,"Your Majesty,"
00:04:58.000,00:05:01.240,午后小主和惠嫔从太后处回来,00:04:58.878,00:05:02.440,My Lady almost fell from her sedan this afternoon
00:05:01.710,00:05:03.330,差点就从轿辇上掉了下来,00:05:02.640,00:05:04.480,"on the way back after visiting
the Empress Dowager with Concubine Vertu."
00:05:03.920,00:05:05.290,因此小主受了惊吓,00:05:04.800,00:05:06.360,My Lady had quite a scare.
00:05:05.760,00:05:06.420,好端端的,,,
00:05:06.680,00:05:08.460,怎么会从轿辇上摔下来呢,00:05:06.720,00:05:09.294,Why would she almost fall from the sedan?
00:05:09.220,00:05:10.960,是台轿子的太监们不小心,,,
00:05:11.350,00:05:12.680,踩了鹅卵石滑倒了,00:05:10.120,00:05:13.560,The carriers accidentally slipped on some loose pebbles.
00:05:12.970,00:05:13.800,在哪里滑倒,00:05:13.960,00:05:15.040,Where was that？
00:05:14.390,00:05:16.720,在储秀宫附近的六棱石子路那里,00:05:15.400,00:05:17.880,"On the hexagonal stone road near
the Palace of Gathering Excellence."
00:05:18.020,00:05:19.980,六棱石子最是防滑,00:05:19.120,00:05:21.080,The hexagonal stones are very slip-resistant.
00:05:20.400,00:05:21.430,怎么会有鹅卵石,00:05:21.360,00:05:22.600,Why were there loose pebbles on the road?
00:05:22.280,00:05:25.520,这事不是责罚台轿辇的奴才,00:05:23.380,00:05:24.403,This matter...
00:05:26.320,00:05:27.230,就能了事的,00:05:24.480,00:05:28.400,does not simply end with punishing the carriers.
00:05:28.200,00:05:30.110,你是怀疑有人要害你是吗,00:05:29.200,00:05:31.210,Do you suspect someone attempted to harm you?
00:05:30.990,00:05:31.730,怎么会呢,00:05:31.868,00:05:33.000,Why would I?
00:05:32.700,00:05:33.860,臣妾不敢这么想,00:05:33.800,00:05:34.978,I dare not think that way.
00:05:35.460,00:05:37.620,臣妾只是觉得自己命数不好,00:05:36.407,00:05:38.567,I only feel that I'm ill-fated.
00:05:38.880,00:05:40.460,虽然承蒙皇上垂爱,,,
00:05:41.090,00:05:42.540,能够再度侍奉在侧,00:05:39.880,00:05:43.720,"Even though Your Majesty bestowed gracious favor on me,
allowing me to serve by your side again,"
00:05:43.630,00:05:47.790,可只怕臣妾终究没有这个福气,00:05:44.730,00:05:45.720,I'm afraid...
00:05:48.050,00:05:49.170,能保住这个孩子,00:05:47.320,00:05:50.240,that I don't have the fortune to keep this child.
00:05:49.550,00:05:50.260,胡说,00:05:50.640,00:05:51.640,Nonsense.
00:05:50.800,00:05:52.720,咱们的孩子是最有福气的孩子,00:05:51.800,00:05:53.840,Our child is the most blessed.
00:05:53.010,00:05:53.920,怎么会保不住,00:05:53.840,00:05:55.003,Of course he will be safe.
00:05:55.140,00:05:56.050,今日的事,00:05:56.240,00:05:57.320,What happened today...
00:05:57.190,00:06:00.680,不是台轿辇的奴才当差不小心,00:05:58.240,00:06:01.720,was not merely the servants' negligence.
00:06:02.980,00:06:05.190,怕是有人看不过朕宠爱你,00:06:03.920,00:06:06.205,I'm afraid that someone did it on purpose
00:06:05.440,00:06:06.400,才故意为之,00:06:06.205,00:06:07.400,out of jealousy.
00:06:07.530,00:06:08.140,苏培盛,,,
00:06:08.570,00:06:09.190,奴才在,00:06:08.408,00:06:09.400,Su Peisheng.
00:06:09.870,00:06:12.200,去把今日给熹妃台轿辇的奴才,00:06:09.448,00:06:10.440,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:06:12.490,00:06:13.480,痛打三十大板,00:06:10.970,00:06:14.690,"Flog Consort Lumière's sedan bearers thirty times heavily,"
00:06:13.740,00:06:14.900,打完再好好审审,00:06:14.690,00:06:16.080,then interrogate them thoroughly.
00:06:15.410,00:06:17.320,敢动朕的人 朕绝不轻饶,00:06:16.426,00:06:18.336,I won't forgive anyone who dares to harm my consort.
00:06:17.660,00:06:18.240,嘛,,,
00:06:18.790,00:06:19.830,苏公公 等一等,00:06:18.720,00:06:19.720,Yes.
,,,00:06:19.800,00:06:20.966,"Please wait, Mr. Su."
00:06:21.960,00:06:24.920,臣妾请求皇上不要张扬此事,00:06:23.060,00:06:24.120,"Your Majesty,"
,,,00:06:24.920,00:06:26.200,I don't wish to spread this incident around.
00:06:26.630,00:06:29.420,此事显然是有人要故意为难你,00:06:27.730,00:06:30.400,Someone obviously attempted to harm you.
00:06:29.930,00:06:30.880,若朕不罚,00:06:30.880,00:06:31.980,"If I don't punish them,"
00:06:31.390,00:06:33.470,以后再发生这样的事该如何,00:06:32.400,00:06:34.520,what if something like this happens again?
00:06:34.470,00:06:36.130,即便真有人要为难臣妾,00:06:35.520,00:06:37.230,"Even if someone really was targeting me,"
00:06:36.930,00:06:38.390,也请皇上和臣妾一样,,,
00:06:38.810,00:06:39.970,相信是无心之失,00:06:37.808,00:06:40.960,"I hope Your Majesty can think of it
as their mindless mistake, which I do."
00:06:41.730,00:06:44.600,臣妾不愿再为一己之身,00:06:42.680,00:06:46.224,I don't want to disturb the peace in the harem
00:06:45.400,00:06:46.480,再使后宫不宁,00:06:46.224,00:06:47.600,"and upset Your Majesty,"
00:06:47.240,00:06:48.220,使皇上烦心,00:06:48.000,00:06:49.320,because of me.
00:06:48.820,00:06:49.980,有过不罚,00:06:49.800,00:06:51.200,Withholding punishment for a mistake ...
00:06:50.700,00:06:52.280,此事又事关龙裔,00:06:51.760,00:06:53.360,especially when it concerns the imperial heir...
00:06:53.030,00:06:54.940,朕心里总是不太舒坦,00:06:54.080,00:06:55.840,it doesn't feel right to me.
00:06:56.040,00:06:57.780,皇上就当为臣妾,00:06:57.140,00:06:58.049,"Your Majesty,"
00:06:58.040,00:06:59.450,和腹中的孩子积福吧,00:06:58.049,00:07:00.400,"your benevolence would accumulate
 Heaven's blessing for me and our child."
00:07:00.670,00:07:02.580,也当给那个人一次回头的机会,00:07:01.720,00:07:03.720,"It would also give the offenders
a second chance to rectify themselves."
00:07:03.380,00:07:05.290,若再有下次一并罚过,00:07:04.360,00:07:06.280,"If they attempt anything again,
the punishment can be combined."
00:07:06.130,00:07:06.790,还有,00:07:07.040,00:07:08.040,"Besides,"
00:07:07.630,00:07:09.710,那些台轿辇的太监也是无心的,00:07:08.640,00:07:10.810,it was truly an accident for the sedan bearers.
00:07:10.590,00:07:13.080,也请皇上饶恕他们好不好,00:07:11.560,00:07:13.391,Could Your Majesty please
,,,00:07:13.391,00:07:14.400, forgive them?
00:07:15.350,00:07:16.050,嬛嬛,00:07:16.120,00:07:17.080,"Huan Huan,"
00:07:17.140,00:07:18.430,你总是愿意体谅,00:07:17.974,00:07:19.560,you are always compassionate and understanding.
00:07:25.440,00:07:26.930,皇上今儿虽没翻牌子,00:07:26.540,00:07:28.287,"Although His Majesty didn't select
a name tag for tonight,"
00:07:27.530,00:07:29.310,但现在都没从永寿宫出来,00:07:28.586,00:07:30.366,he still hasn't stepped out of the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:07:30.240,00:07:31.230,娘娘先睡吧,00:07:31.120,00:07:32.400,Your Majesty should rest.
00:07:31.570,00:07:34.360,熹妃有身孕不能侍寝,00:07:32.560,00:07:34.099,Consort Lumière is pregnant
,,,00:07:34.320,00:07:35.840,and can't serve His Majesty.
00:07:35.490,00:07:39.080,就算不能侍寝皇上都要陪着她,00:07:36.418,00:07:40.178,"Even so, His Majesty still desires her companionship overnight."
00:07:59.810,00:08:01.640,脉象虚浮虚火旺盛,00:08:00.688,00:08:02.578,The pulse is feeble and floating due to empty fire.
00:08:02.440,00:08:03.220,娘娘这几日,,,
00:08:03.900,00:08:06.430,肯定是饮食不调睡不安稳,00:08:03.451,00:08:07.431,"Your Highness must have not been
eating or sleeping well these days."
00:08:07.400,00:08:08.390,若不是微臣来,00:08:08.320,00:08:09.624,"If I hadn't made the visit myself,"
00:08:09.190,00:08:11.180,您还不打算让采月去叫微臣吗,00:08:10.200,00:08:12.197,when would Your Highness have sent Lunar for me?
00:08:12.280,00:08:14.560,嬛儿刚一回宫就差点出事,00:08:13.158,00:08:15.438,Huan'er almost had an accident soon after her return.
00:08:15.160,00:08:17.690,我心里担心可是又没有头绪,00:08:15.994,00:08:18.524,"I'm worried, yet I have no clues to guide me."
00:08:17.990,00:08:20.330,所以才吃不下也睡不好,00:08:19.090,00:08:21.430,That's why I haven't been eating or sleeping well.
00:08:21.450,00:08:22.490,我的身子没事,00:08:22.550,00:08:23.590,I'm fine.
00:08:23.000,00:08:25.160,你看着开个方子也就是了,00:08:24.100,00:08:26.260,You can prescribe some herbs for me and that will do.
00:08:25.540,00:08:28.000,就算娘娘不当自己是千金贵体,00:08:26.640,00:08:29.100,"Even if Your Highness doesn't
give prime concern to your health,"
00:08:28.420,00:08:29.750,那微臣也放心不下呀,00:08:29.400,00:08:30.760,I can't stop worrying about it.
00:08:30.670,00:08:31.660,娘娘素来胄寒,00:08:31.770,00:08:33.320,Your Highness has a cold Stomach.
00:08:32.220,00:08:35.170,若再因为饮食不调而伤了脾胄,,,
00:08:35.550,00:08:36.710,岂不是亏了身子吗,00:08:33.320,00:08:37.779,"You must be careful of your diet or you will damage
your Spleen and Stomach, and your overall health."
00:08:38.050,00:08:39.390,幸好也只是我,,,
00:08:39.680,00:08:41.720,多思烦乱不思饮食,00:08:39.150,00:08:42.800,"Luckily it's only me who has
a worried mind and a poor appetite."
00:08:42.980,00:08:43.560,怎么说,00:08:43.960,00:08:44.960,What do you mean?
00:08:43.980,00:08:46.510,若是嬛儿你必定担心了,00:08:45.040,00:08:47.480,You would be worried if it were Huan'er.
00:08:47.110,00:08:48.020,都是血肉之躯,,,
00:08:48.360,00:08:50.470,熹妃娘娘身子不适微臣自然担心,00:08:48.210,00:08:49.440,You are both made of flesh and blood.
00:08:50.730,00:08:51.640,难道你身子不适,00:08:49.440,00:08:51.600,"Of course I would be worried
if Her Highness Consort Lumière were unwell."
00:08:51.940,00:08:52.930,微臣就不担心了吗,00:08:51.600,00:08:53.920,But why wouldn't I be when you are?
00:08:57.820,00:08:58.860,娘娘的身子要紧,,,
00:08:59.870,00:09:01.530,微臣还是回太医院,00:08:58.880,00:09:00.496,Your Highness's health takes priority.
00:09:02.080,00:09:02.990,给娘娘开方子吧,00:09:00.920,00:09:04.080,"I should go back to the Imperial Infirmary
to prepare the prescription for Your Highness."
00:09:03.960,00:09:04.660,微臣告辞了,00:09:04.920,00:09:06.127,I'll take my leave.
00:09:20.930,00:09:21.970,小主请安累了,00:09:21.920,00:09:23.194,Your Highness must be tired from the daily visit.
00:09:22.770,00:09:24.760,您先宽坐片刻 奴婢去倒茶,00:09:23.720,00:09:24.920,Please sit and rest.
,,,00:09:24.920,00:09:26.127,I will pour some tea.
00:09:37.110,00:09:37.820,已经问到了,,,
00:09:39.410,00:09:40.070,是什么,00:09:38.160,00:09:39.160,I got the answer.
00:09:40.450,00:09:42.160,花匠说那鹅卵石上的青苔,00:09:40.440,00:09:41.440,What is it?
00:09:42.450,00:09:43.190,是蜀地特有的,00:09:41.440,00:09:44.240,"The gardener said the lichen on the pebbles
is a unique kind from Sichuan,"
00:09:43.450,00:09:44.240,叫做牛毛藓,00:09:44.240,00:09:45.240,"called ""calves' hair."""
00:09:44.500,00:09:46.200,只有种着蜀中的矮子松时才有,00:09:45.440,00:09:47.360,"It only grows under dwarf pine trees from
 Central Sichuan."
00:09:46.790,00:09:48.080,而宫中喜欢种这种矮子松,,,
00:09:48.420,00:09:49.120,当盆景的,00:09:47.890,00:09:50.200,"Lady Joie who resides in the Palace of
Gathering Excellence with Concubine Délice"
00:09:49.420,00:09:49.950,只有在储秀宫,,,
00:09:50.210,00:09:51.620,和祺嫔住在一起的欣贵人,00:09:50.200,00:09:52.560,is the only one who cultures dwarf pine bonsai.
00:09:53.090,00:09:54.250,欣贵人也可怜,00:09:54.012,00:09:55.338,Lady Joie is rather pitiful.
00:09:55.340,00:09:56.800,伺候了皇上这么多年,,,
00:09:57.180,00:09:58.130,却还只是个贵人,00:09:56.440,00:09:59.400,"She's only a Noble Lady after many
years of service to His Majesty."
00:09:59.050,00:09:59.710,那个祺嫔,,,
00:10:00.140,00:10:02.090,恨不得乌眼鸡似地生吞了咱们,00:10:00.040,00:10:03.370,"Concubine Délice is like a black-eyed chicken
that wants to gulp us down."
00:10:02.760,00:10:04.250,说不定欣贵人也是帮凶呢,00:10:03.860,00:10:05.440,Lady Joie might be her accomplice.
00:10:05.270,00:10:07.470,小主 你昨晚怎么不趁热打铁,00:10:06.280,00:10:07.300,"My Lady,"
00:10:07.770,00:10:08.630,求皇上做主啊,00:10:07.300,00:10:09.720,"why didn't you emphasize this to His Majesty
 last night, ""when the iron was still hot?"""
00:10:08.980,00:10:09.930,我到底没伤着,00:10:10.000,00:10:11.237,I wasn't injured after all.
00:10:11.190,00:10:13.270,皇上去查出个人来也不会重罚,00:10:12.112,00:10:14.426,"His Majesty wouldn't impose stern punishment
even if he found the culprit."
00:10:14.570,00:10:15.810,倒不如先按下不提,00:10:15.520,00:10:17.213,It's better to set this matter aside for now
00:10:16.360,00:10:17.730,到时候一并发作才好,00:10:17.213,00:10:18.880,and settle the score when more offense occurs.
00:10:23.910,00:10:24.650,启禀娘娘,00:10:24.832,00:10:25.800,"Your Highness,"
00:10:24.950,00:10:26.860,储秀宫的祺嫔和欣贵人到,00:10:25.920,00:10:28.084,Concubine Délice and Lady Joie are here.
00:10:27.460,00:10:28.740,本宫在正殿见她们,00:10:28.560,00:10:30.000,I will see them in the main chamber.
00:10:29.960,00:10:30.370,传,,,
00:10:30.580,00:10:31.200,是,00:10:31.000,00:10:32.160,"- Show them in.
- Yes."
00:10:35.340,00:10:36.670,祺嫔瓜尔佳氏,,,
00:10:36.920,00:10:38.960,携欣贵人拜见熹妃娘娘,00:10:36.440,00:10:40.000,"Concubine Délice and Noble Lady Joie
bow in respect before Your Highness."
00:10:39.430,00:10:40.790,熹妃娘娘金安,,,
00:10:40.970,00:10:41.580,赐座,00:10:40.530,00:10:41.720,Peace to Your Highness.
00:10:44.100,00:10:45.010,多年不见,00:10:41.880,00:10:43.046,Have a seat.
00:10:45.680,00:10:47.670,祺妹妹可滋润不少啊,00:10:45.200,00:10:46.731,It has been years since we last met.
,,,00:10:46.731,00:10:48.592,"Time has treated you well, Délice."
00:10:49.020,00:10:50.880,熹妃娘娘风采如旧,00:10:50.120,00:10:52.040,Your Highness's glamour has remained unchanged.
00:10:51.690,00:10:54.270,一点也瞧不出佛寺待过的样子,00:10:52.640,00:10:55.320,Your time at the temple left hardly a trace.
00:10:55.150,00:10:55.810,是吗,00:10:56.200,00:10:57.368,Is that so?
00:10:57.940,00:11:00.690,当初与你同住碎玉轩时,,,
00:11:01.030,00:11:01.890,是何等和睦,00:10:59.000,00:11:02.978,"How harmonious we were when we lived
together in the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:11:03.070,00:11:04.360,想来也有三年了,00:11:04.080,00:11:05.543,It has been three years now.
00:11:05.910,00:11:08.620,当初你阿玛与本宫父亲交好,00:11:07.010,00:11:09.680,Your father was close to my father back then.
00:11:09.330,00:11:11.410,却不曾想会在暗中诬告,00:11:10.208,00:11:12.886,Who would think he would've secretly contrived to defame my father?
00:11:12.540,00:11:13.700,可见人心之变,,,
00:11:14.170,00:11:16.380,比风采容貌的变化要快多了,00:11:13.640,00:11:17.480,"Evidently, people's hearts
change faster than their appearance."
00:11:16.800,00:11:18.210,熹妃娘娘这张嘴,,,
00:11:18.550,00:11:20.580,向来是宫里数一数二的好,00:11:17.800,00:11:21.440,"Your Highness's silver tongue
has always been unmatched in the harem."
00:11:21.220,00:11:23.000,最能颠倒是非黑白,00:11:22.320,00:11:24.266,"It's most skilled at ""confounding black and white."""
00:11:24.050,00:11:25.460,连娘娘想回宫,00:11:25.080,00:11:26.880,"When Your Highness wished to return to the palace,"
00:11:25.890,00:11:29.180,皇上都可以把汉军旗改为满军旗,00:11:26.880,00:11:30.366,"it even talked His Majesty into changing
your Han banner to a Manchu banner."
00:11:30.390,00:11:31.720,还有什么是不能的,00:11:31.320,00:11:33.010,Is there anything it can't do?
00:11:33.610,00:11:34.720,但总比不过,,,
00:11:34.940,00:11:37.350,人心从白变成黑这样可怕,00:11:34.600,00:11:39.024,"The vast changes I underwent still do not compare to
 the heart that ""turned from white to black."""
00:11:38.440,00:11:41.230,嫔妾还以为祺嫔多敬重熹妃娘娘,00:11:39.540,00:11:42.160,"I thought that Concubine Délice respected
Your Highness greatly."
00:11:41.950,00:11:43.810,把皇后亲赏的红玉珠,00:11:42.960,00:11:45.023,"She wore her finest ornaments to pay her respects,"
00:11:44.070,00:11:46.190,都戴在身上盛装拜见,00:11:45.201,00:11:47.465,"including the Red Jade necklace
which the Empress awarded her."
00:11:46.910,00:11:48.530,没想到这说话呀,00:11:48.010,00:11:49.630,"To my surprise,"
00:11:49.200,00:11:51.120,还是这么地含酸拈醋,00:11:50.200,00:11:52.386,she sounds sour and bitter just the same.
00:11:52.330,00:11:53.700,多年不见欣贵人了,00:11:53.430,00:11:55.090,"I haven't seen you for years, Lady Joie."
00:11:55.210,00:11:56.540,熹妃娘娘金安,00:11:56.310,00:11:57.640,Peace to Your Highness.
00:11:57.340,00:11:59.700,咱们是旧相识不必这样客气,00:11:58.480,00:12:00.720,"We are old acquaintances.
You need not stand on ceremony."
00:12:00.260,00:12:01.540,多谢娘娘记挂,00:12:01.360,00:12:02.560,I thank Your Highness.
00:12:02.800,00:12:04.210,果然是旧相识,00:12:03.900,00:12:05.310,Old acquaintances indeed.
00:12:04.890,00:12:06.470,一个就是主位娘娘,00:12:05.990,00:12:07.570,"But one is now the head of a palace,"
00:12:07.140,00:12:08.500,一个熬了那么多年,,,
00:12:08.810,00:12:09.890,还只是个贵人,00:12:08.120,00:12:10.920,"the other is merely a Noble Lady
even after so many years."
00:12:11.100,00:12:12.720,好好的来给本宫请安,00:12:12.200,00:12:14.151,You came here to pay respects to me.
00:12:13.730,00:12:15.680,祺嫔你是主位,,,
00:12:16.020,00:12:17.180,怎么倒和自己宫里的人,00:12:14.830,00:12:17.120,"Concubine Délice, you are the
head of your palace."
00:12:17.440,00:12:18.270,拌起嘴来了,00:12:17.120,00:12:19.160,Why are you bickering with a resident of your palace?
00:12:18.690,00:12:19.810,岂不伤了体面,,,
00:12:20.280,00:12:21.730,娘娘真是明理之人,00:12:19.612,00:12:20.980,Isn't that indecorous?
00:12:22.530,00:12:23.940,只可惜这永寿宫,00:12:21.158,00:12:22.993,How wise and sensible Your Highness is.
00:12:24.410,00:12:25.990,只赐给娘娘一人独住,00:12:23.630,00:12:25.324,It's a pity that the Palace of Eternal Longevity
,,,00:12:25.324,00:12:27.090,is granted to Your Highness exclusively.
00:12:26.740,00:12:28.900,若是谁能做了娘娘宫里的人,00:12:27.840,00:12:30.000,Anyone residing in Your Highness's palace
00:12:29.200,00:12:31.110,那真是几辈子修来的福分,00:12:30.160,00:12:32.210,must have accumulated blessings from previous lives.
00:12:31.620,00:12:33.030,本宫当是什么呢,00:12:32.720,00:12:34.474,I was wondering what this was all about.
00:12:33.920,00:12:36.410,原来是欣贵人待腻了储秀宫,00:12:34.842,00:12:37.332,"It turns out that Concubine Joie is bored
living in the Palace of Gathering Excellence"
00:12:36.630,00:12:38.080,想做熹妃宫里的人,00:12:37.552,00:12:39.168,and wants to reside with Consort Lumière.
00:12:38.800,00:12:39.910,那有什么难的,00:12:39.900,00:12:41.176,How hard could this be?
00:12:40.510,00:12:43.040,本宫就替你回了皇上的话就是了,00:12:41.520,00:12:44.206,I can make the request to His Majesty for you.
00:12:43.510,00:12:45.170,省得你眼馋心热,,,
00:12:45.430,00:12:47.040,做出这许多腔调来,00:12:44.610,00:12:47.800,"That way you won't feel so desperate
and can stop ""singing an opera"" to me."
00:12:48.050,00:12:51.260,祺嫔这话未免也太瞧得起自己了,00:12:49.150,00:12:52.160,"Concubine Délice, you think too highly of yourself."
00:12:52.020,00:12:53.380,你去回皇上,,,
00:12:54.140,00:12:55.430,你可知道这永寿宫,00:12:52.942,00:12:54.601,You will make a request to His Majesty?
00:12:55.850,00:12:57.470,是皇上亲口下旨,00:12:55.200,00:12:58.600,"Don't you know that His Majesty personally
ordered that the Palace of Eternal Longevity"
00:12:57.770,00:12:59.890,赐给熹妃娘娘一人独住的,00:12:58.600,00:13:01.006,be occupied exclusively by Her Highness Consort Lumière?
00:13:00.690,00:13:02.930,你有多大的本事多大的面子,00:13:01.790,00:13:04.000,What makes you think that you are capable of
00:13:03.530,00:13:05.440,能让皇上收回旨意呀,00:13:04.480,00:13:06.540,influencing His Majesty to take back his decree?
00:13:08.950,00:13:10.360,嫔妾身子有些不适,00:13:07.467,00:13:08.570,Huh?
00:13:11.040,00:13:12.490,就不打扰熹妃娘娘休息了,00:13:10.050,00:13:11.680,I'm not feeling well.
00:13:12.830,00:13:13.440,先告退,00:13:12.000,00:13:13.590,I won't disturb Your Highness any longer.
,,,00:13:13.800,00:13:14.806,I take my leave.
00:13:18.670,00:13:19.530,娘娘你瞧,00:13:19.720,00:13:21.000,Did Your Highness see?
00:13:20.000,00:13:22.460,她当着你的面都敢这么放肆不敬,00:13:21.000,00:13:23.560,"She is so openly insolent and disrespectful
in your presence."
00:13:23.340,00:13:24.620,可知道嫔妾背地里,,,
00:13:24.920,00:13:26.160,受了她多少折磨,00:13:24.440,00:13:27.120,"It's not hard to imagine how much torment
she's made me suffer behind closed doors."
00:13:27.470,00:13:28.380,一别数年,00:13:28.570,00:13:29.723,I didn't expect that
00:13:29.010,00:13:31.850,没想到欣贵人的日子也不好过,00:13:30.020,00:13:32.800,"your life hasn't been going well, Lady Joie."
00:13:32.310,00:13:33.010,是啊,00:13:33.360,00:13:34.240,It hasn't.
00:13:34.270,00:13:35.850,自从挪进了储秀宫,00:13:35.370,00:13:37.116,"Ever since I moved to the Palace of Gathering Excellence,"
00:13:36.940,00:13:38.100,祺嫔明里暗里,,,
00:13:38.350,00:13:39.840,给嫔妾使了太多的绊子,00:13:38.040,00:13:41.250,"She has snared me too many times,
both openly and secretly."
00:13:41.190,00:13:42.560,嫔妾虽然早入宫,00:13:42.290,00:13:44.120,"Even though I entered the palace earlier than she did,"
00:13:43.190,00:13:44.650,但碍于她是主位,00:13:44.120,00:13:45.764,I have to submit to her abuse
00:13:45.150,00:13:47.140,少不了忍气吞声到现在,00:13:46.072,00:13:48.240,because she is the head of my palace.
00:13:47.990,00:13:50.570,那贵人为何不请旨搬离储秀宫呢,00:13:49.000,00:13:51.877,"Why haven't you requested to move out of
the Palace of Gathering Excellence?"
00:13:52.410,00:13:54.240,祺嫔很受皇后的喜爱,00:13:53.510,00:13:55.200,Concubine Délice is quite favored by the Empress.
00:13:55.000,00:13:56.030,有皇后才阑着,00:13:56.040,00:13:57.367,"Her Majesty would never allow it,"
00:13:56.960,00:13:59.200,嫔妾如何走得出储秀宫啊,00:13:58.060,00:14:00.366,"so, how could I ever leave the
Palace of Gathering Excellence?"
00:14:00.790,00:14:02.250,偶尔向皇上提起,00:14:01.712,00:14:03.350,"When I have mentioned this to His Majesty,"
00:14:02.670,00:14:04.250,还被训斥说不安分,00:14:03.770,00:14:05.474,he rebukes me for being discontented.
00:14:07.180,00:14:08.340,贵人既然来了,00:14:08.280,00:14:09.443,"Lady Joie, you came here,"
00:14:09.140,00:14:10.250,又说了这么些话,00:14:10.120,00:14:11.520,and told me these things.
00:14:11.100,00:14:12.680,想必是深思熟虑的,00:14:12.120,00:14:13.680,You must have thought things through.
00:14:13.810,00:14:16.390,有什么话贵人不妨直说,00:14:14.910,00:14:17.490,You may as well speak your mind frankly.
00:14:17.100,00:14:18.310,娘娘快人快语,,,
00:14:18.940,00:14:20.850,嫔妾是不想再寄人篱下了,00:14:18.200,00:14:20.480,"Your Highness is ""a direct person who speaks direct words."""
00:14:23.320,00:14:24.650,贵人是想要本宫,00:14:20.554,00:14:22.529,I don't want to live under her eaves anymore.
00:14:24.860,00:14:27.350,为你向皇上开口离开储秀宫,00:14:24.242,00:14:26.880,Do you want me to make a request to His Majesty
00:14:27.950,00:14:29.860,与其寄人篱下看人眼色,00:14:26.880,00:14:29.050,for you to move out of the Palace of Gathering Excellence?
,,,00:14:29.050,00:14:31.161,"Instead of living under her eaves and
putting up with her moods,"
00:14:30.780,00:14:32.820,不如当个一宫主位来得痛快,00:14:31.800,00:14:33.800,I'd rather become the head of my own palace someday!
00:14:34.080,00:14:35.240,姐姐好志气,00:14:35.040,00:14:36.589,"You are ambitious, Joie!"
00:14:36.620,00:14:39.410,只是这些年本宫吃斋念佛久了,00:14:37.720,00:14:40.360,"Nonetheless, I have been
practicing Buddhism for many years"
00:14:40.170,00:14:42.160,有时候多一事不如少一事,00:14:41.120,00:14:43.200,and I tend to avoid causing trouble.
00:14:45.460,00:14:48.000,嫔妾在宫中无依无靠,00:14:46.382,00:14:49.170,"I have no one in the harem to rely on,"
00:14:48.760,00:14:50.460,娘家又远在千里之外,00:14:49.760,00:14:51.900,and my maiden family is thousands of miles away.
00:14:51.680,00:14:53.170,如今娘娘荣耀回宫,00:14:52.680,00:14:54.640,Your Highness has now triumphantly returned.
00:14:53.600,00:14:56.260,想必这风光背后也少不了辛酸,00:14:54.640,00:14:57.320,But I dare say there must be bitter hardships behind all the glory.
00:14:57.480,00:14:59.260,嫔妾愿与娘娘一同分担,,,
00:14:59.520,00:15:00.300,略尽绵力,00:14:58.402,00:15:01.589,"I'm ready to share Your Highness's hardships
and make my humble contributions."
00:15:02.980,00:15:05.600,贵人的心思本宫心领了,00:15:04.080,00:15:06.600,"I appreciate your thoughts, Lady Joie."
00:15:06.650,00:15:09.730,只是本宫但愿与世无争,00:15:07.750,00:15:10.830,But I wish to stay out of all worldly rivalries.
00:15:10.660,00:15:13.440,有些事或许会力不从心,00:15:11.538,00:15:14.318,I might not be as capable as I wish to be in some matters.
00:15:13.990,00:15:15.820,以娘娘今时今日的地位,00:15:15.090,00:15:16.920,"With Your Highness's rank and influence today,"
00:15:16.040,00:15:17.200,怎么会力不从心,00:15:16.920,00:15:18.452,how could you be incapable?
00:15:18.290,00:15:21.150,再说娘娘已经回宫,00:15:19.390,00:15:20.386,"Besides,"
,,,00:15:20.920,00:15:22.747,"now that Your Highness has returned to the palace,"
00:15:21.870,00:15:24.080,再想与世无争也不得不争,00:15:22.920,00:15:25.200,"you can't stay out of the rivalries
however much you wish to avoid them."
00:15:25.670,00:15:28.580,当然嫔妾这次来得突兀,00:15:26.770,00:15:27.728,"Of course,"
00:15:29.170,00:15:30.380,娘娘心存疑虑,00:15:28.080,00:15:29.520,my visit today was not well planned.
00:15:31.010,00:15:33.000,思量些时候那也是应该的,00:15:30.160,00:15:32.040,It's only natural if Your Highness has doubts
,,,00:15:32.040,00:15:34.123,and needs some time to think it over.
00:15:34.930,00:15:37.970,贵人所说这些事 本宫自会思量,00:15:35.852,00:15:38.892,"I will think about what you said, Lady Joie."
00:15:39.060,00:15:39.720,小允子,,,
00:15:40.060,00:15:40.590,在,00:15:40.120,00:15:41.600,"- Xiao-Yunzi.
- Yes."
00:15:40.810,00:15:42.600,把本宫那盆矮子松拿过来,00:15:41.720,00:15:43.700,Bring in my dwarf pine bonsai.
00:15:43.190,00:15:43.720,嘛,00:15:44.200,00:15:45.120,Yes.
00:15:46.440,00:15:48.270,本宫听闻贵人喜欢矮子松,00:15:47.362,00:15:49.320,I heard that you are fond of dwarf pine.
00:15:48.990,00:15:51.150,今日就特意叫人给备下了,00:15:50.090,00:15:52.243,So I had one prepared for you today.
00:15:51.900,00:15:53.110,连里面搁的鹅卵石,,,
00:15:53.410,00:15:54.440,都是精心挑过的,00:15:52.960,00:15:55.680,Even the pebbles in the pot were carefully selected.
00:15:55.120,00:15:57.230,贵人看看可还喜欢,00:15:56.220,00:15:58.330,Take a look and see if you like it.
00:16:01.830,00:16:02.660,是呢,00:16:02.880,00:16:03.880,Indeed.
00:16:03.170,00:16:05.830,你看这石头上的牛毛藓颜色极正,00:16:04.270,00:16:06.840,"The ""calves' hair"" on the stones has just the right color."
00:16:06.960,00:16:08.540,到底是娘娘宫里的东西,,,
00:16:08.800,00:16:09.960,就是比别人的好,00:16:08.000,00:16:10.920,"Everything in Your Highness's palace
is deservedly better than anyone else's."
00:16:10.340,00:16:11.620,佩儿快收着,,,
00:16:12.180,00:16:12.830,是,00:16:11.400,00:16:12.844,"Violet, take it for me."
00:16:14.220,00:16:15.330,贵人喜欢就好,00:16:13.200,00:16:14.120,Yes.
00:16:16.800,00:16:17.790,可是论名贵,00:16:15.280,00:16:16.526,I'm glad that you like it.
00:16:18.850,00:16:19.800,怎么能比得上,00:16:17.840,00:16:18.960,"Nevertheless,"
00:16:20.100,00:16:22.140,祺嫔脖子上那串红玉珠呢,00:16:19.880,00:16:23.040,"it's certainly not as precious as the
red jade necklace that Concubine Délice was wearing."
00:16:22.520,00:16:24.380,她那是巴结皇后巴结来的,00:16:23.520,00:16:25.320,She ingratiated herself with the Empress.
00:16:24.810,00:16:25.890,皇后亲赏的,00:16:25.840,00:16:27.404,So Her Majesty personally rewarded it to her.
00:16:26.690,00:16:30.020,她为显恩宠十日有八日都戴着,00:16:27.680,00:16:31.166,"She wears it most days to show off
that she's in Her Majesty's favor."
00:16:30.990,00:16:33.070,不过那东西真的是极好,00:16:32.040,00:16:34.040,But that necklace truly is extraordinary.
00:16:33.780,00:16:35.020,独有一股异香,00:16:34.760,00:16:36.120,It has a unique scent.
00:16:35.910,00:16:39.270,味道虽然很淡但好闻得很呢,00:16:37.010,00:16:38.607,"Even though you can only faintly catch the scent,"
,,,00:16:38.880,00:16:40.324,it smells exceptionally good.
00:16:42.870,00:16:44.410,那可当真是好东西呀,00:16:43.920,00:16:45.676,"What a unique piece, indeed!"
00:16:53.220,00:16:55.130,本宫就一直瞧着欣贵人不安分,00:16:54.320,00:16:56.230,Lady Joie has always been unruly.
00:16:55.640,00:16:57.500,果然一离了储秀宫就拨弄是非,00:16:56.680,00:16:58.720,"She provoked a quarrel
as soon as she got the chance."
00:16:57.850,00:16:59.090,好像本宫委屈了她似的,,,
00:16:59.600,00:17:00.680,娘娘是一宫之主,00:16:58.720,00:17:00.434,She made it sound like I've been mistreating her!
00:17:00.930,00:17:02.140,管教她是台举她,00:17:00.434,00:17:01.760,Your Highness is the head of this palace.
00:17:02.480,00:17:04.180,欣贵人既然如此不识抬举,00:17:01.800,00:17:03.600,Your discipline honors her status as a concubine.
00:17:04.480,00:17:06.060,那娘娘只管拿出主子的身份,00:17:03.669,00:17:05.665,"If Lady Joie can't recognize that,"
00:17:06.400,00:17:07.310,来压着她就是了,00:17:05.680,00:17:08.561,Your Highness might as well treat her as your servant.
00:17:07.730,00:17:08.810,如今就敢这样倡狂,,,
00:17:09.110,00:17:09.600,指不定以后,00:17:08.608,00:17:10.168,She's already so insolent now.
00:17:09.940,00:17:10.930,还会干出什么事情来呢,00:17:10.168,00:17:12.007,Who knows what she will be capable of in the future?
00:17:11.650,00:17:12.270,自然,,,
00:17:12.650,00:17:14.440,她以为仗着熹妃就得意了,00:17:12.680,00:17:13.625,Of course.
00:17:14.650,00:17:16.320,熹妃要是没有肚子里那个东西,00:17:13.625,00:17:15.810,"She must be pleased with herself
now that Consort Lumière is at her back."
00:17:16.660,00:17:18.610,想爬进紫禁城做梦去吧,00:17:15.810,00:17:17.771,"If Consort Lumière didn't have that thing in her belly,"
00:17:19.990,00:17:21.200,方才欣贵人说的话,00:17:17.771,00:17:20.000,"she would be crawling back to
the Forbidden City only in her dreams!"
00:17:21.540,00:17:22.650,小主觉得可信吗,00:17:21.090,00:17:23.750,"Does Your Highness believe what
Lady Joie said just now?"
00:17:24.370,00:17:25.740,五分信五分不信,00:17:25.240,00:17:26.928,"""Five out of ten."""
00:17:27.290,00:17:29.160,我方才拿矮子松给她时,00:17:28.390,00:17:30.120,I couldn't tell from her look
00:17:29.750,00:17:31.210,倒真是一点看不出来,00:17:30.800,00:17:32.476,when I gave her the dwarf pine.
00:17:32.550,00:17:33.710,若不是真无辜,00:17:33.650,00:17:35.147,"If she is guilty,"
00:17:34.420,00:17:36.290,便是宫里待久了会做戏了,00:17:35.342,00:17:37.992,"then she must have learned well
how to conduct herself in the palace."
00:17:38.680,00:17:39.840,方才和佩儿说了吗,,,
00:17:40.300,00:17:40.880,说了,00:17:39.602,00:17:41.086,Did you tell Violet?
00:17:41.260,00:17:42.600,佩儿还惦记着娘娘呢,00:17:41.400,00:17:42.320,I did.
00:17:42.850,00:17:44.380,说抽空就过来给小主回话,00:17:42.320,00:17:43.720,"And she said she still has
Your Highness in her thoughts."
,,,00:17:43.720,00:17:45.651,"She will report back when she gets a chance, My Lady."
00:17:46.230,00:17:48.060,等我问问她再做定论,00:17:47.330,00:17:49.200,I will make up my mind after speaking with her.
00:17:50.650,00:17:51.600,越想越生气,00:17:51.680,00:17:53.252,"The more I think about it, the angrier I feel."
00:17:52.280,00:17:54.310,我就是瞧不上祺嫔那轻狂的样子,00:17:53.252,00:17:55.240,Concubine Délice's insolent face irritates me.
00:17:54.860,00:17:55.650,难道她忘了,,,
00:17:55.860,00:17:56.730,从前在小主面前,,,
00:17:57.030,00:17:58.190,百般讨好的嘴脸了吗,00:17:55.840,00:17:59.112,"Has she forgotten how she used to
fawn over Your Highness?"
00:17:59.990,00:18:01.030,你以为她傻,00:18:00.912,00:18:02.248,Do you think she's stupid?
00:18:02.200,00:18:03.780,她知道与我积怨已深,00:18:03.122,00:18:05.000,"She knows that given our deep feud,"
00:18:05.120,00:18:07.110,此刻在我面前俯首称臣,00:18:06.160,00:18:08.400,"even if she bowed her head and submitted to me now,"
00:18:07.460,00:18:08.870,我未必能容得下她,00:18:08.400,00:18:09.970,I wouldn't necessarily accept her.
00:18:09.380,00:18:10.660,皇后更容不下她,00:18:10.258,00:18:11.887,And the Empress would be even more unforgiving.
00:18:11.840,00:18:13.120,索性与我翻了脸,,,
00:18:13.800,00:18:14.830,我反而立时三刻,00:18:12.940,00:18:14.560,So she decided to offend me openly
00:18:15.130,00:18:16.210,不能拿她怎么办了,00:18:14.900,00:18:17.310,and now I don't know what to do with her.
00:18:17.720,00:18:19.460,反正祺嫔跟着皇后,00:18:18.820,00:18:20.913,"Regardless, as long as Concubine Délice
follows the Empress,"
00:18:20.430,00:18:23.510,是生不出孩子挣不到出路的,00:18:21.480,00:18:24.520,she won't be able to have a child to secure her future.
00:18:25.020,00:18:26.180,小主何出此言,00:18:25.960,00:18:27.574,"Why would you say that, My Lady?"
00:18:27.730,00:18:28.640,你看到她脖子上,,,
00:18:28.940,00:18:29.890,那串红玛瑙串了吗,00:18:28.790,00:18:30.990,Did you notice her red jade necklace?
00:18:31.270,00:18:32.680,任凭她有什么好东西,00:18:32.370,00:18:33.968,"Whatever jewels she may have,"
00:18:33.110,00:18:34.560,难道咱们永寿宫就没有吗,00:18:34.210,00:18:35.890,our palace has something better.
00:18:36.110,00:18:37.690,那是红麝香珠,00:18:37.177,00:18:38.757,That necklace is red musk beads.
00:18:38.950,00:18:40.110,看着像红玛瑙,00:18:40.034,00:18:41.487,"It looks like red agate,"
00:18:40.990,00:18:43.360,这东西只怕在宫里,,,
00:18:43.580,00:18:44.570,也找不出几串来,00:18:42.040,00:18:45.520,which is rarely seen in the palace.
00:18:46.080,00:18:47.440,我方才听欣贵人说,,,
00:18:47.790,00:18:50.200,那东西有香味我便更肯定了,00:18:47.002,00:18:49.840,"After Lady Joie mentioned that it has a scent,"
,,,00:18:50.080,00:18:51.567,I became certain.
00:18:51.920,00:18:55.280,那麝香珠是取雄麝的麝香做的,00:18:52.980,00:18:56.200,That necklace is made from the glands of male musk deer.
00:18:56.260,00:18:57.590,用久了损伤肌理,00:18:57.200,00:18:58.930,Long term exposure will cause harm through the skin
00:18:58.170,00:18:59.460,便再也生不出孩子了,00:18:59.120,00:19:00.851,and lead to infertility.
00:19:01.550,00:19:03.510,那她怎么堂而皇之地,00:19:02.600,00:19:03.600,Then...
00:19:03.760,00:19:04.750,把它挂在身上,00:19:03.680,00:19:05.720,Why is she wearing it publicly?
00:19:05.350,00:19:06.710,也没有人告诉她缘由吗,00:19:06.320,00:19:07.904,Hasn't anyone warned her?
00:19:07.850,00:19:08.930,一来这东西难得,,,
00:19:09.230,00:19:10.430,寻常人分辨不出,00:19:08.950,00:19:11.537,"For one thing, it is quite rare,
so most people don't recognize it."
00:19:11.150,00:19:13.510,二来你没听欣贵人说,00:19:12.200,00:19:14.726,"On the other hand,
didn't you hear Lady Joie say that"
00:19:14.440,00:19:15.850,那是皇后娘娘赏的,00:19:15.480,00:19:17.086,it was a reward from the Empress?
00:19:17.490,00:19:18.470,即便太医知道,00:19:18.440,00:19:20.000,"Even if the imperial doctors knew,"
00:19:19.450,00:19:21.230,也没有人敢告诉祺嫔吧,00:19:20.440,00:19:22.400,they would not dare to tell Concubine Délice.
00:19:23.740,00:19:24.820,你去小厨房看看,,,
00:19:25.490,00:19:26.860,给胧月做的菜做好了吗,00:19:24.800,00:19:26.210,Go to the kitchen
00:19:27.830,00:19:28.990,也不知她爱不爱吃,00:19:26.480,00:19:28.250,and see if the dishes for Longyue are ready.
00:19:30.750,00:19:32.450,胧月公主自幼离开小主,00:19:28.880,00:19:30.327,I wonder whether or not she will like them.
00:19:32.830,00:19:33.910,难免会生疏些,00:19:31.850,00:19:33.600,"My Lady, Princess Longyue was away
 from you since she was very young."
00:19:34.630,00:19:36.290,不过过久了就一定会好的,00:19:33.800,00:19:35.497,It's natural that she's grown a little distant.
,,,00:19:35.680,00:19:37.600,I am sure it will improve over time.
00:19:38.760,00:19:39.750,但愿如此,00:19:39.860,00:19:40.850,I hope so.
00:19:43.760,00:19:45.000,来 公主吃饭,,,
00:19:45.510,00:19:46.500,乖啊 公主,00:19:44.812,00:19:46.250,"Have a bite, Princess."
00:19:46.810,00:19:47.510,胧月,00:19:46.480,00:19:47.560,Please eat.
00:19:48.310,00:19:49.970,来让本宫来喂吧,00:19:47.681,00:19:48.680,Longyue.
00:19:51.390,00:19:52.510,来 胧月,00:19:49.330,00:19:51.155,Let me feed her.
00:19:52.980,00:19:54.140,吃饭饭,00:19:52.393,00:19:53.612,"Here, Longyue,"
,,,00:19:54.017,00:19:55.370,let's eat-eat.
00:19:56.770,00:19:58.180,来一口,00:19:57.760,00:19:59.120,Take a bite.
00:20:00.780,00:20:02.610,乖 多吃一点,00:20:01.840,00:20:03.520,Good. Have some more.
00:20:02.860,00:20:04.600,果然公主还是听娘娘的话,00:20:03.720,00:20:05.600,"The Princess listens to Your Highness
more than anyone else."
00:20:04.820,00:20:05.860,看进得多香啊,00:20:05.720,00:20:07.170,She eats so heartily.
00:20:06.870,00:20:07.700,真乖,00:20:07.920,00:20:09.168,Such a good girl.
00:20:10.120,00:20:11.740,再吃一口 娘娘吉祥,00:20:11.172,00:20:12.643,"- One more bite.
- Grace to Your Highness."
00:20:12.330,00:20:12.950,起来吧,00:20:13.320,00:20:14.200,Rise.
00:20:13.750,00:20:14.960,娘娘正好在吃饭呀,00:20:14.800,00:20:16.248,This is good timing.
00:20:15.540,00:20:17.250,今天小厨房做了几道菜,00:20:16.560,00:20:18.406,Our kitchen prepared some dishes today.
00:20:17.710,00:20:19.790,熹妃估摸着小公主喜欢吃,00:20:18.760,00:20:20.800,"Consort Lumière thought the
Princess might like them"
00:20:20.130,00:20:21.170,就叫奴婢带了过来,00:20:20.920,00:20:22.450,and asked me to bring them over.
00:20:21.880,00:20:24.170,真是精致啊 快搁这儿,00:20:22.840,00:20:24.166,They're so exquisite!
00:20:24.470,00:20:25.550,胧月正好要吃饭呢,00:20:24.400,00:20:26.560,Put them here. Longyue is just about to eat.
00:20:27.050,00:20:28.540,那奴婢就先告辞了,,,
00:20:28.760,00:20:29.380,好,00:20:28.150,00:20:29.640,I will take my leave then.
,,,00:20:29.760,00:20:30.680,Yes.
00:20:41.570,00:20:44.030,来我们多吃点菜菜好不好,00:20:42.487,00:20:45.155,"Here, let's eat more vegetables."
00:20:49.030,00:20:49.990,真乖,00:20:50.035,00:20:51.069,Such a good girl.
00:20:51.910,00:20:53.820,皇上待娘娘还是最有心思,00:20:52.776,00:20:54.864,His Majesty is most thoughtful towards Your Highness.
00:20:54.580,00:20:56.700,特地把莲花移种到这些大缸里,00:20:55.640,00:20:57.800,"The lotuses were specifically
transferred here into these urns,"
00:21:00.300,00:21:01.960,省得娘娘怀着身孕,,,
00:21:02.260,00:21:03.840,还要走那么远去赏莲了,00:21:01.400,00:21:04.940,"so Your Highness wouldn't have to walk far
to enjoy them while pregnant."
00:21:05.630,00:21:06.840,莲花有香气,00:21:06.730,00:21:08.230,Lotus flowers are fragrant
00:21:08.180,00:21:11.050,这盛暑天里最容易招小虫子了,00:21:09.280,00:21:12.150,and most prone to attract small flies in summer.
00:21:13.350,00:21:16.060,娘娘是不喜欢这些莲花呢,00:21:14.378,00:21:17.197,Is it the lotus flowers that Your Highness dislikes
00:21:17.270,00:21:18.810,还是安排莲花的人哪,00:21:18.320,00:21:20.264,or the person who arranged them?
00:21:21.650,00:21:22.610,那年生辰,00:21:22.680,00:21:23.760,"On my birthday that year,"
00:21:24.110,00:21:26.100,我见过圆明园满湖的莲花,00:21:25.160,00:21:27.367,"I saw the lake filled with lotus blooms
in the Summer Palace."
00:21:28.120,00:21:29.320,后来人再怎么做,00:21:29.160,00:21:30.731,No one could match that effort
00:21:30.160,00:21:31.900,也不过是东施效颦罢了,00:21:31.160,00:21:32.880,no matter how hard they tried.
00:21:34.540,00:21:35.570,娘娘佩儿来了,,,
00:21:36.460,00:21:37.120,快请进来,00:21:35.608,00:21:36.680,"Your Highness, Violet is here."
00:21:37.460,00:21:37.950,嘛,00:21:37.480,00:21:38.400,Bring her in.
,,,00:21:38.560,00:21:39.400,Yes.
00:21:48.640,00:21:49.550,给娘娘请安,00:21:49.740,00:21:50.886,Peace to Your Highness.
00:21:50.680,00:21:52.040,快起来来,00:21:51.780,00:21:52.720,Rise.
00:21:53.310,00:21:54.050,谢娘娘,00:21:54.410,00:21:55.320,I thank Your Highness.
00:21:57.310,00:21:58.770,本宫瞧你跟着欣贵人,,,
00:21:59.440,00:22:00.520,人都瘦了一圈,00:21:58.232,00:22:01.640,"You have slimmed down
now that you're serving Lady Joie."
00:22:01.900,00:22:03.230,欣贵人待你不好吗,00:22:02.955,00:22:04.648,Is Lady Joie mistreating you?
00:22:03.650,00:22:06.560,是奴婢无福 不能回来伺候娘娘,00:22:04.648,00:22:07.520,"I don't have the fortune to come back
and serve Your Highness."
00:22:07.660,00:22:08.900,昨日听欣贵人说,,,
00:22:09.240,00:22:10.360,是来给娘娘请安的,00:22:08.760,00:22:11.460,"When I heard yesterday that Lady Joie was
 coming to pay respects to Your Highness,"
00:22:10.620,00:22:12.980,奴婢欣喜坏了 就忙跟着过来了,00:22:11.520,00:22:14.035,I was overjoyed and quickly followed her.
00:22:15.120,00:22:16.330,听说菊青没了,00:22:16.220,00:22:17.608,I heard that Daisy is gone.
00:22:17.540,00:22:18.530,是怎么回事,00:22:18.640,00:22:19.640,What happened?
00:22:19.880,00:22:21.210,娘娘出宫没多久,00:22:20.940,00:22:22.520,"Shortly after Your Highness left the palace,"
00:22:21.500,00:22:23.740,安嫔就说菊青得了肠痨暴毙,00:22:22.520,00:22:24.800,"Concubine An said Daisy died suddenly
 of some intestinal disease."
00:22:24.050,00:22:25.880,连夜就把尸身拖出去给烧了,00:22:24.880,00:22:26.925,Her body was cremated that same night.
00:22:26.300,00:22:27.750,其实奴婢偷偷去看过,00:22:27.384,00:22:28.917,But I sneaked a peek before that.
00:22:28.510,00:22:30.420,菊青的口鼻里全是黑血,00:22:29.610,00:22:31.520,Daisy's mouth and nose were filled with black blood.
00:22:30.890,00:22:32.050,分明是被毒死的,00:22:31.800,00:22:33.206,She was obviously poisoned.
00:22:35.470,00:22:37.140,菊青虽是服侍安嫔的人,00:22:36.570,00:22:38.240,"Even though Daisy was serving Concubine An,"
00:22:38.060,00:22:39.890,可到底是从本宫这儿出去的,00:22:39.160,00:22:40.990,she had come from my palace.
00:22:40.600,00:22:41.840,可怜人就这么没了,00:22:41.600,00:22:43.368,How pitiful that she died this way.
00:22:43.690,00:22:45.060,若是欣贵人待你不好,00:22:44.720,00:22:46.407,"If Lady Joie hasn't been treating you well,"
00:22:45.780,00:22:47.190,本宫自然会为你做主,00:22:46.800,00:22:48.366,I'll certainly bring you justice.
00:22:48.070,00:22:48.900,谢娘娘,00:22:49.120,00:22:50.120,I thank Your Highness.
00:22:49.950,00:22:50.940,自娘娘走后,00:22:51.000,00:22:52.120,"After Your Highness left,"
00:22:51.320,00:22:53.230,奴婢便被分到了欣贵人那里,00:22:52.280,00:22:54.240,I was assigned to serve Lady Joie
00:22:53.830,00:22:56.280,后来又跟着欣贵人搬去了储秀宫,00:22:54.930,00:22:57.568,"and later followed her move to
the Palace of Gathering Excellence."
00:22:56.950,00:22:59.070,可是储秀宫的主位是祺嫔,00:22:58.050,00:23:00.080,"However, Concubine Délice is the head of that palace."
00:22:59.670,00:23:01.370,她恨奴婢服侍过娘娘,00:23:00.680,00:23:02.480,"She resents me for having served
Your Highness in the past"
00:23:02.040,00:23:04.120,动不动就对奴婢打骂不休,00:23:03.040,00:23:05.320,and frequently abuses me verbally and physically.
00:23:06.840,00:23:07.700,去取药酒来,,,
00:23:07.970,00:23:08.620,嘛,00:23:07.720,00:23:09.776,"- Go bring some liniment!
- Yes."
00:23:11.550,00:23:12.670,本宫当年一走,,,
00:23:13.180,00:23:14.510,虽然也为你们安排了,00:23:12.472,00:23:15.502,"Although I made arrangements
for all of you before I left,"
00:23:15.470,00:23:17.010,可到底也是力所不能及,00:23:16.440,00:23:18.488,I wasn't able to protect you as much as I wished.
00:23:17.850,00:23:19.090,终究还是连累了你们,,,
00:23:19.890,00:23:20.970,能服侍娘娘一场,00:23:18.728,00:23:20.360,All of you suffered because of me.
00:23:21.310,00:23:22.550,已经是奴婢的福气了,00:23:20.990,00:23:23.600,"It was already Heaven's blessing
that I had served Your Highness."
00:23:23.440,00:23:24.800,在其他小主眼里,00:23:24.540,00:23:26.148,"In other concubines' eyes,"
00:23:25.480,00:23:28.570,我们这些人就是命不值钱的奴才,00:23:26.480,00:23:29.560,we're just servants living worthless lives.
00:23:29.900,00:23:30.980,奴婢身份低微,00:23:31.000,00:23:32.246,I am a lowly maid.
00:23:31.450,00:23:33.690,怎能让娘娘为奴婢做这些事情,00:23:32.440,00:23:34.600,"How do I deserve Your Highness
doing this for me?"
00:23:34.240,00:23:36.400,来忍着点啊,00:23:35.240,00:23:36.240,"Here,"
,,,00:23:36.840,00:23:38.124,it'll sting a bit.
00:23:42.370,00:23:43.860,可你到底是欣贵人的人,00:23:43.280,00:23:45.071,"But after all, you are Lady Joie's maid."
00:23:44.460,00:23:45.750,她也不为你说句话吗,00:23:45.520,00:23:47.000,Why doesn't she speak up for you?
00:23:46.880,00:23:48.620,欣贵人见祺嫔打骂奴婢,,,
00:23:48.960,00:23:50.200,觉得自己脸面过不去,00:23:47.980,00:23:51.240,"Whenever I was punished, Lady Joie
 would argue briefly with Concubine Délice,"
00:23:50.880,00:23:52.000,也会分辩几句,00:23:51.800,00:23:53.160,to save her own face.
00:23:53.050,00:23:54.040,可是下次,,,
00:23:54.930,00:23:56.340,祺嫔就下手更重,00:23:53.972,00:23:55.407,"The next time, however,"
00:23:58.600,00:23:59.840,主位是可以自行责罚,00:23:56.000,00:23:57.729,Concubine Délice would only hit me harder.
00:24:00.180,00:24:01.800,自己宫中的任何宫人的,00:23:59.522,00:24:02.627,"The head of a palace has the right to punish
any residents in her palace."
00:24:02.310,00:24:03.970,就算佩儿是欣贵人的人,00:24:03.232,00:24:04.975,"Even though Violet is Lady Joie's maid,"
00:24:04.440,00:24:05.470,也不能维护啊,,,
00:24:06.730,00:24:07.940,这欣贵人与祺嫔,00:24:05.440,00:24:06.888,Lady Joie couldn't defend her.
00:24:08.610,00:24:09.940,当真不睦已久了吗,00:24:07.760,00:24:11.000,"Is it true that Lady Joie and Concubine
Délice have been at odds for a long time?"
00:24:10.360,00:24:11.070,当真,00:24:11.360,00:24:12.360,It is.
00:24:15.820,00:24:18.490,你的心意本宫都知道,00:24:16.920,00:24:19.590,I understand your thoughts for me.
00:24:20.370,00:24:22.330,其实你在欣贵人那儿过得不好,00:24:21.470,00:24:23.752,"Since you're having a hard time serving Lady Joie,"
00:24:23.040,00:24:25.080,本宫倒是可以想法子把你要出来,00:24:24.000,00:24:26.120,I could find a way to bring you back.
00:24:26.090,00:24:27.620,只是祺嫔与本宫的恩怨,,,
00:24:27.920,00:24:28.710,你是知道的,00:24:27.190,00:24:29.680,"But you know about the feud
between Concubine Délice and me."
00:24:29.800,00:24:30.960,你可愿意为了本宫,,,
00:24:31.380,00:24:32.540,留意她们俩的动静,00:24:30.678,00:24:33.600,"Would you be willing to stay at
the Palace of Gathering Excellence for now"
00:24:33.050,00:24:34.510,暂时留在储秀宫里吗,00:24:34.000,00:24:35.684,to help me keep an eye on them?
00:24:35.260,00:24:36.090,奴婢愿意,00:24:36.182,00:24:37.326,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:24:40.470,00:24:41.090,皇上,00:24:41.520,00:24:42.520,"Your Majesty,"
00:24:42.020,00:24:43.260,敬事房的人来了,00:24:43.040,00:24:44.440,Attendant Service is here.

00:24:52.780,00:24:56.740,朕有些日子没见欣贵人了,00:24:53.800,00:24:57.880,I haven't seen Lady Joie for a while.
00:24:58.580,00:25:00.280,皇上驾到,00:24:59.600,00:25:01.720,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:25:07.250,00:25:08.830,臣妾恭迎皇上,,,
00:25:09.040,00:25:09.580,起来吧,00:25:08.360,00:25:10.640,"- Peace to Your Majesty.
- Rise."
00:25:18.760,00:25:20.380,别追我别追我,00:25:19.600,00:25:21.400,Stop! Stop chasing me!
00:25:21.270,00:25:22.000,别过来,,,
00:25:22.180,00:25:22.890,什么声音,00:25:22.120,00:25:23.120,Stay away!
,,,00:25:23.120,00:25:24.212,What was that?
00:25:25.770,00:25:26.630,老声音了,00:25:26.760,00:25:27.720,Just as before.
00:25:26.850,00:25:29.310,来人哪好害怕呀,00:25:27.720,00:25:30.320,Someone come! I'm scared.
00:25:29.610,00:25:30.770,祺嫔又梦魇了,00:25:30.320,00:25:32.000,Concubine Délice is having nightmares again?
00:25:31.530,00:25:32.140,皇上,00:25:32.480,00:25:33.480,Your Majesty!
00:25:34.700,00:25:36.730,皇上 祺嫔梦魇了,00:25:35.760,00:25:37.830,"Your Majesty, Concubine Délice is having a nightmare."
00:25:37.070,00:25:38.360,请您过去瞧瞧,00:25:38.000,00:25:39.460,Will you please come?
00:25:38.740,00:25:40.450,别过来皇上,00:25:39.560,00:25:40.291,Stay away!
,,,00:25:40.291,00:25:41.480,Your Majesty!
00:25:43.160,00:25:45.070,那朕过去瞰瞰,00:25:44.160,00:25:46.348,I'll go over to take a look.
00:25:46.750,00:25:49.160,那皇上你还会回来吗,00:25:47.800,00:25:50.260,Will Your Majesty come back?
00:25:50.500,00:25:52.240,朕今儿翻的是你的牌子,00:25:51.520,00:25:53.426,I selected your name tag for tonight.
00:25:53.130,00:25:54.040,自然会回来,00:25:54.040,00:25:55.240,"Of course, I'll be back."
00:26:04.180,00:26:06.720,皇上 臣妾方才梦魇醒了,00:26:05.280,00:26:07.720,"Your Majesty, I just woke up from a nightmare."
00:26:07.020,00:26:07.880,心慌得厉害,00:26:07.960,00:26:09.080,My heart is pounding.
00:26:08.690,00:26:10.220,您替臣妾揉一揉好不好,00:26:09.680,00:26:11.280,Can you please rub my chest for me?
00:26:10.900,00:26:13.110,你瞧你老是梦魇,00:26:12.000,00:26:14.160,You have had nightmares many times.
00:26:13.650,00:26:15.270,也不找个太医好好瞧瞧,,,
00:26:15.820,00:26:17.060,臣妾找太医看了,00:26:14.720,00:26:16.920,"Why didn't you call for an imperial doctor
to have a thorough exam?"
00:26:17.530,00:26:18.860,太医说宫里阴气重,00:26:16.920,00:26:18.400,I've already seen the doctors.
00:26:19.360,00:26:20.770,所以臣妾梦魇不宁,00:26:18.400,00:26:20.168,They said that yin is too strong in the palace
00:26:21.080,00:26:21.860,阴气重,00:26:20.400,00:26:21.826,and causes my persistent nightmares.
,,,00:26:22.000,00:26:23.000,Yin is too strong?
00:26:22.990,00:26:25.910,那宫里就只剩朕阳气重了,00:26:24.090,00:26:27.120,"Then I'm the only one in the palace
who has enough yang to balance it out?"
00:26:27.080,00:26:29.160,可不是皇上是真龙天子,00:26:28.000,00:26:29.011,Of course.
00:26:29.540,00:26:30.580,您的阳气最盛,00:26:29.011,00:26:30.260,As the Son of Heaven.
00:26:30.960,00:26:32.070,什么东西都压得住,00:26:30.480,00:26:31.920,Your Majesty's yang is the strongest
,,,00:26:31.920,00:26:33.366,and can overpower anything.
00:26:33.380,00:26:36.590,皇上 您听听臣妾心慌不慌,00:26:34.400,00:26:35.320,"Your Majesty,"
,,,00:26:35.600,00:26:37.600,why don't you listen to my heartbeat for yourself?
00:26:41.760,00:26:43.000,小主怎么不拦着呀,00:26:42.860,00:26:44.400,"My Lady, why didn't you keep His Majesty here?"
00:26:43.470,00:26:45.300,皇上这一走肯定不回来,00:26:44.480,00:26:46.480,His Majesty surely won't return now that he's gone.
00:26:46.520,00:26:48.550,小半年皇上才来咱们这儿一回,00:26:47.620,00:26:49.520,"His Majesty only visits a few times a year,"
00:26:49.020,00:26:51.140,回回都赶上祺嫔发梦魇,00:26:50.040,00:26:52.120,"and Concubine Délice happens to
have a nightmare every time."
00:26:53.820,00:26:55.310,就知道才拦不住,00:26:54.920,00:26:56.403,I knew I couldn't stop him.
00:26:57.030,00:26:58.610,以前又不是没拦过,00:26:58.040,00:26:59.686,It's not that I have never tried before.
00:26:59.570,00:27:00.730,不都还是去了吗,00:27:00.440,00:27:02.003,His Majesty leaves for her anyway.
00:27:13.880,00:27:14.460,真的,,,
00:27:14.630,00:27:15.290,是,,,
00:27:15.710,00:27:17.420,欣贵人位分低 一直不太得宠,00:27:14.920,00:27:16.280,"- Really?
- Yes."
00:27:17.840,00:27:19.170,祺嫔争宠争不过旁人,00:27:16.720,00:27:18.520,Lady Joie ranks lower and has never been in high favor.
00:27:19.510,00:27:20.670,却敢抢欣贵人的恩宠,00:27:18.718,00:27:20.270,Concubine Délice can't compete with others for favor
00:27:21.220,00:27:22.750,每每皇帝宿在欣贵人那里时,00:27:20.520,00:27:21.928,yet can easily steal it from Lady Joie.
00:27:23.300,00:27:25.130,祺嫔便想尽法子把皇上请走,00:27:22.320,00:27:23.920,"Whenever His Majesty stays in Lady Joie's residence,"
00:27:25.720,00:27:27.430,那皇后和敬妃也不管管吗,00:27:24.400,00:27:26.204,"Concubine Délice tries everything
to lure His Majesty away."
00:27:27.980,00:27:29.930,敬妃娘娘空有个协理六宫的名义,00:27:26.760,00:27:28.530,Have the Empress and Consort Estime never intervened?
00:27:30.230,00:27:31.560,内里是什么也说不上话,00:27:29.080,00:27:30.990,"Consort Estime's authority to manage
the harem is in name only."
00:27:31.940,00:27:32.890,而皇后那儿左不过,00:27:31.240,00:27:32.600,Her words carry no weight.
00:27:33.230,00:27:34.770,是两个争风吃醋的嫔妃闹着,00:27:32.998,00:27:35.648,"To Her Majesty, it's nothing more than
a squabble between two jealous concubines."
00:27:35.070,00:27:36.770,不痛不痒申斥两句也就过了,00:27:36.000,00:27:37.760,"The complaints were brushed off
with some perfunctory condemnation."
00:27:37.480,00:27:38.100,蠢货,00:27:38.440,00:27:39.400,Idiot.
00:27:40.030,00:27:40.610,什么,,,
00:27:41.240,00:27:42.190,儿子恭喜额娘,00:27:41.130,00:27:42.000,What?
00:27:42.660,00:27:43.740,那个蠢货是替额娘,00:27:42.243,00:27:43.480,"I should congratulate you, Mother."
00:27:44.120,00:27:45.070,在宫中立威铺路呢,00:27:43.600,00:27:46.328,"That idiot is paving the way for you
to establish authority in the palace."
00:27:47.790,00:27:48.400,小允子,,,
00:27:48.580,00:27:49.160,在,,,
00:27:49.450,00:27:50.440,祺嫔既然说梦魇,00:27:48.800,00:27:50.120,"- Xiao-Yunzi.
- Yes."
,,,00:27:50.260,00:27:51.680,"Since Concubine Délice claims to have nightmares,"
00:27:50.830,00:27:53.450,那本宫就赏一壶糙米苍仁汤给她,00:27:51.680,00:27:54.400,I'll send her a pot of brown rice and Job's tears soup.
00:27:54.000,00:27:54.540,嘛,00:27:55.000,00:27:55.800,Yes.
00:27:55.040,00:27:56.870,记得要拿五个大碗公那么大的壶,00:27:56.040,00:27:57.920,"Remember to send a pot large enough
to fill five big bowls."
00:27:57.340,00:27:59.750,祺嫔的梦魇要紧 也不必煮熟了,00:27:58.360,00:27:59.796,Curing Concubine Délice's nightmares is the top priority.
00:28:00.220,00:28:01.080,滚了就拿过去吧,00:27:59.796,00:28:01.000,There is no time to cook it thoroughly.
00:28:01.260,00:28:01.870,嘛,00:28:01.120,00:28:02.240,Bring it over once it starts boiling.
00:28:02.220,00:28:03.460,想必皇上还在她那儿,00:28:02.240,00:28:03.080,Yes.
00:28:03.890,00:28:04.670,你亲自送去,00:28:03.200,00:28:04.840,His Majesty must still be at her place.
00:28:05.100,00:28:06.760,当着皇上的面 她不敢不喝,00:28:04.840,00:28:05.840,Take it over yourself.
00:28:07.140,00:28:07.750,奴才明白,00:28:06.120,00:28:08.040,She dares not refuse it in front of His Majesty.
00:28:08.020,00:28:08.630,对,00:28:08.040,00:28:08.880,I understand.
00:28:08.890,00:28:10.050,就让她好好地喝一壶,00:28:09.120,00:28:11.160,"Exactly, let her have a good drink of her medicine."
00:28:10.520,00:28:11.350,不准喝不完,,,
00:28:11.600,00:28:13.010,嗻 奴才这就去办,00:28:11.440,00:28:12.700,Not a drop should be left.
00:28:13.230,00:28:14.470,你好像很讨厌祺嫔,00:28:12.700,00:28:14.120,"Yes, I will arrange it right away."
00:28:15.730,00:28:17.350,宫里面就只有额娘最疼我了,00:28:14.120,00:28:15.600,You seem to loathe Concubine Délice.
00:28:18.150,00:28:19.390,那些仗势欺人的人,00:28:16.652,00:28:18.560,"Mother, you're the only one in the palace
who cares about me."
00:28:19.740,00:28:20.650,额娘不喜欢的人,,,
00:28:21.200,00:28:21.930,儿子都讨厌,00:28:19.120,00:28:23.120,"I loathe any snob who takes advantage
 of others, and anyone you disapprove of."
00:28:31.540,00:28:33.780,自己小主没本事 还泼什么水呀,00:28:32.640,00:28:34.960,"Your mistress was inadequate!
You are splashing water around so easily -"
00:28:34.080,00:28:35.620,有本事把皇上招回去呀,00:28:34.960,00:28:37.254,"so, why didn't you bring His Majesty back
if you're so capable?"
00:28:37.880,00:28:39.410,现在心口还慌吗,00:28:38.802,00:28:40.480,Is your heart still racing?
00:28:40.210,00:28:42.500,皇上不来臣妾总是心慌,00:28:41.088,00:28:43.520,My heart always races when Your Majesty is not here.
00:28:43.840,00:28:45.130,那朕再听听,,,
00:28:45.590,00:28:46.210,皇上,00:28:44.940,00:28:46.440,Let me hear your heartbeat again?
,,,00:28:46.520,00:28:47.520,"Your Majesty,"
00:28:46.720,00:28:48.710,熹妃娘娘让奴才送东西给祺嫔,00:28:47.820,00:28:50.000,"Consort Lumière asked me to deliver
something for Concubine Délice."
00:28:49.180,00:28:50.720,什么东西进来说吧,00:28:50.200,00:28:51.760,What is it? Come inside.
00:28:57.810,00:28:59.350,娘娘听说祺嫔梦魇心慌,,,
00:28:59.730,00:29:00.690,特意让奴才煮了一壶,00:28:58.910,00:29:00.888,"Her Highness heard that Concubine Délice
had a nightmare that affected her heart,"
00:29:00.980,00:29:01.770,糙米苍仁汤来,00:29:00.888,00:29:02.800,"so she ordered me to bring a pot of
brown rice and Job's tears soup."
00:29:02.150,00:29:03.810,太医说解梦压是最好的,00:29:03.120,00:29:05.086,The doctors said it's the best remedy for nightmares.
00:29:04.860,00:29:06.480,快喝了它专治你的病,00:29:05.880,00:29:07.520,Drink it up. It's best for your illness.
00:29:07.490,00:29:08.200,臣妾不喝,00:29:08.520,00:29:09.611,I don't want to drink it.
00:29:11.410,00:29:13.370,臣妾喝了皇上就不来了,00:29:12.288,00:29:14.400,Your Majesty won't come again if I am cured.
00:29:15.040,00:29:16.450,朕来不来是一回事,00:29:16.080,00:29:17.560,Whether I come or not has nothing to do with this.
00:29:17.290,00:29:19.580,熹妃为你好你就喝了它,00:29:18.390,00:29:19.760,Consort Lumière cares about your health.
00:29:21.380,00:29:22.040,小主请吧,00:29:19.760,00:29:20.760,You should drink it.
00:29:25.260,00:29:26.750,这糙米怎么喝得下去啊,00:29:22.360,00:29:23.484,"Please, My Lady."
00:29:27.300,00:29:28.210,臣妾不喝,00:29:26.280,00:29:27.974,How could I swallow this thing with brown rice?
00:29:28.720,00:29:29.840,娘娘说良药苦口,00:29:28.280,00:29:29.520,"No, I won't drink it."
00:29:30.060,00:29:31.890,但凡是药都不会是好喝的玩意儿,00:29:29.642,00:29:31.473,"Her Highness said that ""Good medicine tastes bitter."""
,,,00:29:31.473,00:29:32.960,A good remedy is usually unpalatable.
00:29:32.270,00:29:34.180,您为了玉体安康喝了吧,00:29:33.240,00:29:35.280,Please consume it for Your Highness's health.
00:29:34.600,00:29:35.560,拿开拿开 不喝,00:29:35.600,00:29:36.887,No! Take it away.
00:29:37.270,00:29:39.810,你若是不喝这药就说明你没病,00:29:38.370,00:29:40.910,"If you won't take the medicine,
it means you're not sick,"
00:29:40.690,00:29:43.150,以前都是诓朕来着,00:29:41.720,00:29:44.220,and you were deceiving me all along.
00:30:06.380,00:30:09.050,娘娘盼咐了药要喝尽了才好呢,00:30:07.480,00:30:10.240,Her Highness said that it's best to drink it all.
00:30:28.780,00:30:30.610,你和祺嫔置什么气呀,00:30:29.800,00:30:31.710,Why did you give Concubine Délice a hard time?
00:30:32.330,00:30:33.530,她就是这样的性子,00:30:33.320,00:30:34.566,That's just the way she is.
00:30:34.450,00:30:37.620,虽然肤浅张狂倒也不失可爱,00:30:35.480,00:30:37.137,"Although shallow and arrogant,"
00:30:37.910,00:30:40.000,皇上以为不过纵容祺嫔几次,00:30:37.440,00:30:38.720,she is still rather adorable.
00:30:40.540,00:30:41.370,却不想后宫众人,00:30:38.880,00:30:41.480,"Your Majesty might think that condoning Concubine
Délice's behavior has no significance."
00:30:41.880,00:30:43.290,以后都会群起效仿,00:30:41.480,00:30:44.280,"But everyone else in the harem
would follow suit from now on."
00:30:44.380,00:30:47.170,欣贵人之流日久难免心生怨恨,00:30:45.302,00:30:48.225,"Over time, resentment will inevitably
 build up in concubines like Lady Joie,"
00:30:47.630,00:30:49.710,而祺嫔之流则恃宠而骄,00:30:48.508,00:30:50.588,"while those like Concubine Délice
will grow conceited over their favor."
00:30:50.180,00:30:52.040,如此一宫不宁则后宫不宁,00:30:51.240,00:30:53.040,One unpeaceful palace will lead to an unsettled harem.
00:30:52.510,00:30:54.630,长久下去岂非酿成大祸,00:30:53.520,00:30:55.640,Won't it cause greater trouble eventually?
00:30:56.430,00:30:58.850,嬛嬛此言很识大体,00:30:57.308,00:30:59.880,I appreciate your prudence and consideration.
00:31:00.100,00:31:00.970,如你所说,00:31:01.022,00:31:02.114,"As you said,"
00:31:01.560,00:31:04.930,朕是该对祺嫔略施薄惩,00:31:02.660,00:31:06.030,"I should impose a modest punishment on Concubine Délice,"
00:31:05.980,00:31:08.690,也要对欣贵人加以安慰,00:31:07.000,00:31:09.790,and offer comfort to Lady Joie.
00:31:10.780,00:31:11.570,此事一出,00:31:11.880,00:31:13.000,"After this,"
00:31:11.910,00:31:14.360,后宫再没有妃嫔敢恃宠而骄,00:31:13.000,00:31:15.320,"no concubine in the palace will dare to
grow conceited over her favor."
00:31:14.870,00:31:16.610,太后知道了很是欣慰,,,
00:31:16.950,00:31:17.990,不住口地赞你,00:31:15.920,00:31:17.843,The Empress Dowager was very pleased
00:31:18.370,00:31:19.330,太后也知道了,00:31:17.843,00:31:19.120,and couldn't stop praising you.
00:31:19.710,00:31:21.790,合宫里还有谁不知道的,00:31:19.280,00:31:20.760,"Her Majesty heard about it, too?"
,,,00:31:20.760,00:31:22.890,Who in the palace hasn't?
00:31:22.170,00:31:24.120,熹妃娘娘好大的气势,00:31:23.270,00:31:25.480,"""Her Highness Consort Lumière has quite the demeanor."""
00:31:24.750,00:31:27.540,一下子就镇住了后宫不良之风,00:31:25.640,00:31:28.640,"""She immediately quelled the
improper behaviors in the palace."""
00:31:28.130,00:31:30.340,太后本来还对你心存疑虑,00:31:29.052,00:31:31.320,The Empress Dowager initially had doubts about you.
00:31:30.840,00:31:32.920,现下倒是一百个放心了,00:31:31.840,00:31:33.880,Now she trusts you with all her heart.
00:31:33.600,00:31:35.340,你哪里晓得我的为难之处,00:31:34.600,00:31:36.526,You don't know the difficulty I had.
00:31:36.220,00:31:37.840,若不是拿祺嫔做样子,00:31:37.120,00:31:39.147,"If I hadn't used Concubine Délice to set an example,"
00:31:38.980,00:31:40.930,难免太后总对我心存疑虑,00:31:39.960,00:31:42.000,I wouldn't be able to gain Her Majesty's trust
00:31:41.230,00:31:42.180,怕我狐媚惑主,00:31:42.120,00:31:43.728,"and prove that I am not a ""bewitching minx."""
00:31:43.230,00:31:44.470,现在动手张扬了,00:31:44.330,00:31:45.840,"But now that I've made my mark,"
00:31:44.900,00:31:46.760,更有人把我恨成眼中钉了,00:31:45.880,00:31:47.884,"someone will hate me for being
a thorn in their side."
00:31:48.240,00:31:50.150,讨得太后欢心才是要紧,00:31:49.340,00:31:51.333,"It's more important to please
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager."
00:31:51.610,00:31:52.770,在太后眼里,00:31:52.710,00:31:53.994,"In Her Majesty's eyes,"
00:31:53.370,00:31:55.200,我这些不过是雕虫小技,00:31:54.470,00:31:56.763,"my little trick was like ""writing in bird-worm script."""
00:31:57.290,00:31:59.320,何况后宫不良之风,,,
00:31:59.620,00:32:00.610,哪里能压得住呢,00:31:58.212,00:32:01.564,"Besides, the unhealthy behaviors in the harem
can never be fully cleaned up."
00:32:01.160,00:32:02.500,不过是有所收敛罢了,00:32:02.082,00:32:03.888,They will only show restraint temporarily.
00:32:03.880,00:32:05.290,倒楣了连走路都走不顺,,,
00:32:05.670,00:32:06.330,好好的踩一脚泥,00:32:04.980,00:32:06.390,I'm so unlucky I can't even have a pleasant walk.
,,,00:32:06.440,00:32:07.652,My shoes are all covered in mud now.
00:32:09.880,00:32:12.340,小主别生气平白气坏了身子,00:32:10.980,00:32:12.166,"Please don't be mad, My Lady."
,,,00:32:12.166,00:32:13.360,It can harm your health.
00:32:12.970,00:32:14.550,欣贵人平时不声不响,00:32:13.892,00:32:15.472,Lady Joie is usually reticent.
00:32:15.470,00:32:17.880,一转眼倒学会去旁人面前告状了,00:32:16.480,00:32:18.890,"But when I turned my eyes away from her,
she dared to tell on me."
00:32:18.270,00:32:20.100,当真是会咬人的狗不叫,00:32:19.148,00:32:21.040,"She is truly ""the quiet dog that bites."""
00:32:20.480,00:32:22.260,本宫被狗咬了能不倒楣吗,00:32:21.402,00:32:23.488,Being bitten by this dog brought me all the bad luck.
00:32:22.890,00:32:24.130,小主暂且忍一忍吧,,,
00:32:24.440,00:32:26.300,现下就连皇上也偏帮着欣贵人,00:32:23.768,00:32:25.571,"It's better to endure it for the time being, My Lady."
00:32:26.690,00:32:27.520,给熹妃撑腰呢,00:32:25.571,00:32:28.520,"Even His Majesty is partial to Lady Joie now
to show support for Consort Lumière."
00:32:28.110,00:32:29.440,熹妃算什么东西,,,
00:32:30.150,00:32:31.690,仗着皇上还愿意多看两眼,00:32:29.120,00:32:30.607,Consort Lumière is a nobody!
00:32:32.110,00:32:33.070,她那副妖媚样子,00:32:31.160,00:32:33.880,"Just because His Majesty hasn't
grown tired of her bewitching face,"
00:32:33.410,00:32:34.360,她就来作践我,,,
00:32:34.660,00:32:36.110,也不瞧瞧自己是什么东西,00:32:34.240,00:32:35.480,she thinks she can tread on me!
00:32:36.700,00:32:38.490,在佛寺里待着还不安分,00:32:35.480,00:32:37.244,Better look at herself in the mirror!
00:32:38.790,00:32:39.990,绞尽脑汁地勾引皇上,00:32:37.800,00:32:39.590,She was not satisfied living in a temple
,,,00:32:39.590,00:32:41.440,and racked her brains to seduce His Majesty.
00:32:40.580,00:32:42.570,以为大个肚子有什么了不得的吗,00:32:41.680,00:32:43.670,What's the big deal with her big belly?
00:32:43.170,00:32:44.450,本宫总要让她知道厉害,00:32:44.000,00:32:45.688,One day she'll know what I'm capable of!
00:32:45.330,00:32:46.910,你有多厉害本宫不知道,00:32:46.360,00:32:48.160,"I may not know what you're capable of,"
00:32:47.880,00:32:50.040,本宫只知道隔墙有耳,00:32:48.920,00:32:51.200,but I know the walls have ears.
00:32:50.670,00:32:54.130,祺嫔还是善自珍重的好,00:32:51.770,00:32:53.040,"Concubine Délice,"
,,,00:32:53.200,00:32:55.230,you'd better take care of yourself.
00:32:55.140,00:32:56.720,有这会子骂人的工夫,00:32:56.240,00:32:58.128,The time you're wasting on grouching and grumbling
00:32:57.470,00:33:00.010,还不如多喝几碗糙米苍仁汤,00:32:58.440,00:33:01.280,"could've been better spent on taking
more brown rice and Job's tears soup"
00:33:00.390,00:33:02.220,好好治一治梦魇的毛病,00:33:01.280,00:33:03.368,to treat your nightmares.
00:33:03.230,00:33:04.810,是熹妃是熹妃啊,00:33:04.240,00:33:05.960,Consort Lumière... It is Consort Lumière!
00:33:05.060,00:33:06.520,小主别出声,00:33:06.560,00:33:07.620,"Be quiet, My Lady."
00:33:13.200,00:33:15.060,额娘 额娘不生气,00:33:14.120,00:33:15.090,"Mother,"
,,,00:33:15.200,00:33:16.420,you're not upset?
00:33:16.780,00:33:18.940,记着任何时候,00:33:17.680,00:33:18.715,"Remember,"
00:33:19.240,00:33:21.280,都不要为不值得的人不值得的事,,,
00:33:21.540,00:33:22.900,费时间费心力,00:33:19.040,00:33:23.991,"don't ever waste time and energy on
anyone or anything unworthy."
00:33:23.830,00:33:24.440,是,00:33:24.840,00:33:25.800,Yes.
00:33:41.310,00:33:43.170,贵客来了我有失远迎,00:33:42.410,00:33:43.746,A distinguished guest is here.
00:33:43.770,00:33:44.850,真是失礼了,00:33:43.746,00:33:46.000,I should have been welcoming you far outside the door.
00:33:47.190,00:33:50.650,多年不见端姐姐的气色见好了,00:33:48.290,00:33:51.750,"Honnête, you look much healthier over the years."
00:33:51.730,00:33:52.940,谢谢妹妹请,00:33:52.840,00:33:54.200,"Thank you, Lumière. Please."
00:34:02.450,00:34:03.570,有了温宜呀,00:34:03.372,00:34:04.640,"With Wenyi in my life,"
00:34:03.910,00:34:05.780,这漫长的日子就好打发多了,00:34:04.640,00:34:06.920,the long days are much easier to pass.
00:34:06.540,00:34:08.450,要不然这一年年地熬着,00:34:07.640,00:34:09.638,"Otherwise, I would be dragging myself
from year to year"
00:34:08.830,00:34:10.240,连个盼头也没有,00:34:09.638,00:34:11.280,with nothing to look forward to.
00:34:13.460,00:34:15.040,姐姐真是好福气,00:34:14.400,00:34:15.962,You are so lucky.
00:34:15.550,00:34:18.540,我的胧月却不爱答理我,00:34:16.650,00:34:17.688,My Longyue...
,,,00:34:18.440,00:34:19.723,isn’t close to me.
00:34:21.560,00:34:25.590,敬妃心疼胧月更胜于我心疼温宜,00:34:22.560,00:34:24.362,Consort Estime loves Longyue
,,,00:34:24.720,00:34:26.690,even more than I love Wenyi.
00:34:26.350,00:34:29.310,到底是打出生就养在身边的,00:34:27.272,00:34:30.232,"After all, Longyue was raised by her since birth"
00:34:30.060,00:34:32.220,胧月自然要与她亲近些,00:34:31.160,00:34:33.240,and naturally feels closer to her.
00:34:33.360,00:34:35.440,眼下敬妃的心不安哪,00:34:34.460,00:34:36.540,"Right now, Consort Estime cannot put her mind at ease."
00:34:36.950,00:34:38.030,将心比心,00:34:38.050,00:34:39.480,"To put myself in her state of mind,"
00:34:38.490,00:34:41.400,如果要是现在襄嫔活过来,00:34:39.480,00:34:43.640,"I imagine if Concubine Aide came back to life
and asked to take Wenyi back,"
00:34:41.700,00:34:42.610,找我要回温宜,,,
00:34:43.030,00:34:44.990,我也是万般地不情愿哪,00:34:43.640,00:34:45.920,I would also be extremely reluctant.
00:34:47.910,00:34:48.650,我明白,00:34:48.920,00:34:49.920,I understand.
00:34:50.670,00:34:52.500,敬妃呀 她是个明白人,00:34:51.720,00:34:53.600,Consort Estime is a sensible person.
00:34:53.250,00:34:54.540,可是再明白的人,00:34:54.240,00:34:55.680,"But no matter how sensible one is,"
00:34:55.300,00:34:57.250,她也禁不住一个情字,00:34:56.222,00:34:58.280,one can't fight love.
00:34:58.010,00:35:00.170,更何况是母女之情,00:34:58.888,00:35:01.120,Not to mention it is a mother's love for her daughter.
00:35:01.600,00:35:03.630,你不在宫里的时候不知道,00:35:02.520,00:35:04.480,You don't know what happened while you were away.
00:35:04.430,00:35:07.300,那一年哪胧月病了,00:35:05.440,00:35:06.527,"One year,"
,,,00:35:07.240,00:35:08.486,Longyue was sick.
00:35:08.020,00:35:10.730,敬妃几天几夜都没有合眼,00:35:08.960,00:35:11.608,Consort Estime didn't sleep for days on end.
00:35:11.480,00:35:14.390,要是那个时候胧月留不住了,00:35:12.580,00:35:15.440,"Had Longyue not been saved at that time,"
00:35:15.030,00:35:17.390,只怕敬妃也要伤心死了,00:35:16.040,00:35:18.320,"I'm afraid Consort Estime would've
died from a broken heart as well."
00:35:19.610,00:35:20.820,我这个做额娘的,,,
00:35:21.410,00:35:22.860,的的确确是没有尽到半分,00:35:20.560,00:35:22.173,"Even though I am her birth mother,"
00:35:23.240,00:35:24.110,做娘的心思,00:35:22.440,00:35:25.120,I truly didn't provide her any motherly care.
00:35:25.080,00:35:27.610,哪里还敢奢求胧月有多亲近我呢,00:35:26.120,00:35:28.600,How can I expect Longyue to be close to me?
00:35:28.870,00:35:29.660,我只盼着,00:35:29.920,00:35:31.053,I only hope
00:35:30.580,00:35:32.660,她能认我这个娘就好了,00:35:31.640,00:35:33.566,that she will recognize me as her mother one day.
00:35:33.000,00:35:34.830,若说你没有尽娘的心思,00:35:33.878,00:35:35.880,Even I think it's wrong and unfair
00:35:35.300,00:35:37.250,连我听了我都觉得委屈,00:35:36.280,00:35:38.528,if you say that you didn't provide her any motherly care.
00:35:38.380,00:35:39.170,你说当年,00:35:39.480,00:35:40.518,"Back then,"
00:35:39.720,00:35:41.750,你生下胧月才三天就离宫,00:35:40.600,00:35:43.309,"you left the palace only three days
after giving birth to Longyue."
00:35:42.430,00:35:44.040,那三天的弹精竭虑,,,
00:35:44.550,00:35:46.340,哪一点不是为她一辈子,00:35:43.530,00:35:45.491,"In those three days, you racked your brain"
00:35:46.680,00:35:47.670,做尽了打算,00:35:45.491,00:35:48.760,"and exhausted all of your thoughts
to plan for her entire future."
00:35:55.150,00:35:58.440,但是我还是要劝你一句话,00:35:56.120,00:35:57.234,"Nevertheless,"
,,,00:35:57.600,00:35:59.360,I still need to offer this advice.
00:35:59.360,00:36:01.150,别急着接回胧月,00:36:00.194,00:36:02.201,Don't rush to take Longyue back to your palace.
00:36:01.860,00:36:03.480,就算你思女心切,00:36:02.960,00:36:04.931,"Even though you miss your daughter dearly,"
00:36:04.280,00:36:05.740,那也得忍耐呀,00:36:05.280,00:36:06.840,you have to bear it.
00:36:06.530,00:36:09.030,你现在是以钮佑禄氏的身份入宫,00:36:07.630,00:36:10.130,You returned to the palace as a Niohuru.
00:36:09.500,00:36:12.160,莞嫔甄氏的女儿你要少沾染,00:36:10.378,00:36:13.286,"You should stay away from the daughter
of Concubine Souire from the Zhen family"
00:36:13.380,00:36:15.330,才会少些闲话呀,00:36:14.120,00:36:16.240,to keep gossip down.
00:36:16.920,00:36:19.580,姐姐的话我记着了,00:36:18.020,00:36:20.680,I'll keep your words in mind.
00:36:24.760,00:36:26.880,好了好了 看你热的,00:36:25.594,00:36:27.960,"Look at you, you are sweating."
00:36:27.430,00:36:29.800,额娘带你去千鲤池好不好,00:36:28.530,00:36:30.900,How about I take you to the Thousand Carp Pond?
00:36:29.970,00:36:30.680,好,00:36:31.000,00:36:31.920,Yes.
00:36:36.860,00:36:37.850,熹妃妹妹,00:36:37.960,00:36:39.198,Consort Lumière.
00:36:41.110,00:36:43.270,胧月快给熹妃娘娘请安,00:36:42.160,00:36:44.370,"Longyue, hurry up and greet Her Highness."
00:36:43.700,00:36:45.150,熹妃娘娘好,00:36:44.720,00:36:46.250,"Greetings, Your Highness."
00:36:53.160,00:36:54.450,额娘抱你去玩好不好,00:36:54.038,00:36:55.480,Can Mother take you to play together?
00:36:54.830,00:36:56.200,我不要我不要,00:36:55.708,00:36:57.160,"No, No ..."
00:36:58.460,00:37:00.950,胧月可能正玩在兴头上,00:36:59.560,00:37:02.050,Longyue was playing and was interrupted
00:37:01.300,00:37:02.460,不愿让人抱的,00:37:02.320,00:37:03.807,so she doesn't want to be picked up.
00:37:05.550,00:37:06.670,就为了那一句,,,
00:37:06.970,00:37:08.430,让她和妹妹回去住的话,00:37:06.650,00:37:09.640,"After hearing about moving to live with you,"
00:37:09.350,00:37:11.380,她整整哭闹了一日呢,00:37:10.240,00:37:12.270,she cried for a whole day.
00:37:11.640,00:37:13.930,不如就让她在咸福宫再住几日吧,00:37:12.270,00:37:14.920,"Why not let her stay at the Palace of
Universal Happiness for a few more days?"
00:37:14.190,00:37:15.100,姐姐说什么呢,00:37:14.920,00:37:16.497,"Estime, what are you talking about?"
00:37:15.980,00:37:16.810,姐姐的孩子,00:37:16.858,00:37:18.120,She's your child.
00:37:17.310,00:37:19.140,自然是跟姐姐住在咸福宫里,00:37:18.200,00:37:20.240,"Of course, she will live with you in the
Palace of Universal Happiness."
00:37:21.190,00:37:23.150,我不过是想领她玩耍一会儿罢了,00:37:22.080,00:37:24.080,I only wanted to play with her for a while.
00:37:23.900,00:37:25.520,我们要去千鲤池喂鱼,00:37:24.840,00:37:26.620,"We are heading to the Thousand Carp Pond
to feed the fish."
00:37:25.820,00:37:27.860,不如妹妹同去,00:37:26.620,00:37:29.000,Why don't you come with us?
00:37:29.990,00:37:31.150,宫里还有些事,00:37:30.960,00:37:32.744,I have things to attend to in my palace.
00:37:31.910,00:37:33.370,姐姐陪胧月慢慢玩吧,00:37:32.744,00:37:34.608,Please enjoy your time with Longyue.
00:37:34.830,00:37:37.040,胧月 快跟额娘说再见,00:37:35.930,00:37:38.083,"Longyue, say goodbye to your Mother."
00:37:53.890,00:37:54.680,娘娘别生气,,,
00:37:55.060,00:37:56.340,本宫有什么好生气的,00:37:54.720,00:37:55.958,"Don't be angry, Your Highness."
00:37:56.900,00:37:58.180,多个人疼公主是好事,00:37:56.000,00:37:57.440,What's there to be angry about?
00:37:58.860,00:38:00.100,可敬妃娘娘似乎忘记了,00:37:57.778,00:37:59.680,"It's a good thing that the princess has
one more person who loves her."
00:38:00.480,00:38:01.390,谁才是公主的生母,00:37:59.680,00:38:02.440,"But Consort Estime seems to have forgotten
who the princess's birth mother is."
00:38:02.190,00:38:03.930,方才敬妃邀娘娘,,,
00:38:04.280,00:38:05.230,陪公主一同去喂鱼,00:38:03.290,00:38:06.400,"Just now, Consort Estime invited Your Highness
to feed the fish with the princess."
00:38:05.570,00:38:06.430,娘娘若是去的话,,,
00:38:06.780,00:38:08.320,不是正能和公主多亲近吗,00:38:06.400,00:38:09.240,"Wouldn't it have been a good chance
to get close to the princess?"
00:38:09.320,00:38:10.940,敬妃若是真心邀我去的话,00:38:10.360,00:38:12.040,"If Consort Estime genuinely wanted to invite me,"
00:38:11.330,00:38:12.570,适才一见到我就会开口,00:38:12.040,00:38:13.600,she would have asked as soon as we met.
00:38:13.450,00:38:15.070,且她们去是母女情深,00:38:14.550,00:38:16.814,"Besides, they're savoring their time together
as mother and daughter."
00:38:15.910,00:38:16.820,本宫去了,00:38:17.010,00:38:18.120,"If I went along,"
00:38:17.670,00:38:19.660,又不知道会生出多少嫌隙来,00:38:18.720,00:38:20.843,who knows how many more rifts would be created?
00:38:20.080,00:38:21.160,好没意思,00:38:21.080,00:38:22.326,What's the point of that?
00:38:22.380,00:38:23.370,敬妃也没错,,,
00:38:23.960,00:38:25.370,胧月的生母是甄氏,00:38:23.480,00:38:24.806,Consort Estime was not wrong.
,,,00:38:25.000,00:38:26.440,Longyue's birth mother is Zhen.
00:38:26.550,00:38:27.790,我是钮祜禄氏,00:38:27.600,00:38:28.920,I am Niohuru.
00:38:28.590,00:38:30.000,算哪门子的生母,00:38:29.640,00:38:31.183,How can I be her birth mother?
00:38:34.560,00:38:35.390,姐姐,00:38:35.560,00:38:36.560,Lumière.
00:38:40.440,00:38:41.140,姐姐好,,,
00:38:42.020,00:38:42.890,许久不见,00:38:41.400,00:38:42.648,"Greetings, Lumière."
00:38:43.900,00:38:45.360,妹妹当真是贵人了,00:38:43.120,00:38:44.640,It's been a long time since we last met.
00:38:46.280,00:38:47.770,姐姐才是真正的贵人,00:38:45.000,00:38:46.520,You've become a distinguished concubine now.
,,,00:38:47.320,00:38:49.280,You are the truly distinguished one.
00:38:48.860,00:38:52.030,原以为姐姐要在外飘零孤苦一世,00:38:49.960,00:38:53.130,"I originally thought that you would have to
live a harsh and lonely life outside."
00:38:52.740,00:38:54.280,叫妹妹好生牵挂,00:38:53.720,00:38:55.240,I was so worried about you.
00:38:55.120,00:38:56.700,不曾想峰回路转,00:38:56.220,00:38:57.968,But things turned like the mountain road twists.
00:38:57.210,00:38:59.700,竟有今日添丁添福的好时候,00:38:58.200,00:39:00.848,"Now you live in an elevated moment,
 bringing another heir to the family."
00:39:00.540,00:39:02.950,哪里真有十全十美的好时候呢,00:39:01.640,00:39:04.128,No one can have a truly perfect moment.
00:39:03.960,00:39:05.540,做人总有不足之处,00:39:05.000,00:39:06.763,There are always imperfections in life.
00:39:06.800,00:39:09.380,即便妹妹今天身为嫔位,00:39:07.900,00:39:10.442,Even though you have advanced to Concubine
00:39:09.840,00:39:10.880,掌一宫主位,00:39:10.800,00:39:12.248,"and head your own palace,"
00:39:11.470,00:39:13.550,想来也有意难平的时候吧,00:39:12.570,00:39:14.808,"there must be times when things
don't go the way you wish."
00:39:14.890,00:39:15.920,姐姐走后,,,
00:39:16.180,00:39:18.220,陵容替姐姐服侍皇上那么久,00:39:15.920,00:39:19.120,Since you left I have been serving His Majesty in your place.
00:39:18.640,00:39:19.970,竟没有一子半女,00:39:19.640,00:39:21.124,Yet I still don't have a child.
00:39:20.600,00:39:22.260,当真是陵容福薄,00:39:21.700,00:39:23.529,I have to say I'm not blessed by Heaven.
00:39:22.860,00:39:25.270,只是自己的亲生女儿,,,
00:39:25.610,00:39:27.140,竟成了别人的孩子,00:39:23.920,00:39:28.240,"Even so, the daughter you gave birth to
is now someone else's child."
00:39:28.110,00:39:29.440,姐姐感觉如何,00:39:29.210,00:39:30.724,How does that make you feel?
00:39:31.740,00:39:33.350,胧月自幼不在我身边,00:39:32.840,00:39:34.657,Longyue hasn't lived with me since birth.
00:39:34.200,00:39:36.070,不与我亲近也是情理中事,00:39:35.078,00:39:37.250,It’s not surprising that she’s not close to me.
00:39:36.950,00:39:37.940,但我相信,00:39:38.050,00:39:39.080,But I believe
00:39:38.910,00:39:42.080,做人有得亦有失,00:39:39.920,00:39:43.180,that there is a gain for every loss in life.
00:39:43.330,00:39:44.290,比起妹妹,,,
00:39:45.460,00:39:47.040,我肚子里这个孩子,00:39:44.430,00:39:45.688,"In comparison,"
00:39:47.420,00:39:49.000,或许怀得更运气些,00:39:46.560,00:39:50.100,"I am a little more fortunate than you, to get pregnant quickly."
00:39:50.170,00:39:51.410,有得亦有失,00:39:51.270,00:39:52.726,There is a gain for every loss.
00:39:51.930,00:39:54.510,陵容只怕姐姐得不偿失呢,00:39:53.030,00:39:55.560,"I'm only worried that the gain
won't cover your loss."
00:39:54.760,00:39:55.800,妹妹说得有道理,00:39:55.560,00:39:56.926,I agree with you.
00:39:57.520,00:39:58.800,但比起有些人,00:39:58.620,00:39:59.879,"In the meantime,"
00:39:59.020,00:40:01.720,用尽心机却尽失人心,00:39:59.879,00:40:03.050,"some people tried their utmost to scheme,
only to lose everyone's trust and support."
00:40:02.900,00:40:04.010,只怕到头来,00:40:03.778,00:40:05.195,I’m afraid that...
00:40:04.810,00:40:07.020,是竹篮打水一场空呢,00:40:05.640,00:40:08.000,"they're ""drawing water with a sieve""
and all their efforts were in vain."
00:40:07.280,00:40:08.390,姐姐说得极是,00:40:08.058,00:40:09.480,I couldn't agree more.
00:40:08.990,00:40:10.940,其实姐姐前几日在储秀宫,,,
00:40:11.200,00:40:12.650,差点滑落轿辇,00:40:10.090,00:40:13.440,"I also heard that you almost fell
from the sedan the other day"
00:40:13.030,00:40:14.320,妹妹也有所耳闻,00:40:13.674,00:40:15.524,when passing the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:40:14.700,00:40:15.980,幸好姐姐无恙,00:40:15.760,00:40:17.326,Thankfully you were not hurt.
00:40:16.870,00:40:18.980,妹妹真是替姐姐捏一把汗呢,00:40:17.840,00:40:20.080,"I was ""rubbing my sweating hand"" for you."
00:40:19.700,00:40:21.540,安妹妹所指储秀宫,00:40:20.800,00:40:22.888,"The Palace of Gathering Excellence, you said?"
00:40:24.080,00:40:25.740,欣贵人伺候皇上久了,00:40:25.180,00:40:27.047,Lady Joie has served His Majesty for a long time.
00:40:26.460,00:40:28.000,性子烈些也是有的,00:40:27.520,00:40:29.166,It's understandable that she has developed some fire.
00:40:28.380,00:40:30.460,姐姐真以为是欣贵人做的吗,00:40:29.440,00:40:31.526,Do you really believe it was done by Lady Joie?
00:40:31.220,00:40:32.670,姐姐仔细去想想,00:40:32.240,00:40:33.804,"If you think about it carefully,"
00:40:33.380,00:40:37.050,储秀宫中谁与姐姐积怨已久啊,00:40:34.440,00:40:36.120,who in the Palace of Gathering Excellence
,,,00:40:36.120,00:40:38.124,has a long-standing feud with you?
00:40:38.260,00:40:39.750,她阿玛归她阿玛,00:40:39.320,00:40:40.967,What her father did is a separate issue.
00:40:40.350,00:40:41.890,她到底也不曾对我怎样,00:40:41.280,00:40:42.924,She hasn't done anything to me personally.
00:40:42.940,00:40:44.470,姐姐宅心仁厚,00:40:44.040,00:40:45.647,It's benevolent of you to think that way.
00:40:45.230,00:40:46.810,她一直想取代姐姐,00:40:46.200,00:40:48.120,But she has always wanted to replace you.
00:40:47.150,00:40:48.680,姐姐如何就不明白呢,00:40:48.120,00:40:49.640,How can you not understand?
00:40:49.690,00:40:51.680,她是皇后跟前的红人,00:40:50.790,00:40:52.720,She is most favored by the Empress.
00:40:52.820,00:40:54.060,妹妹怎敢在背后,,,
00:40:54.490,00:40:56.070,说这种无凭无据的话呢,00:40:53.880,00:40:57.170,"How dare you speak against her
behind her back without any evidence?"
00:40:57.450,00:40:59.530,妹妹从前做过的错事太多,00:40:58.328,00:41:00.687,I’ve made too many mistakes in the past
00:41:00.330,00:41:01.990,见别人的错事也多,00:41:01.240,00:41:03.417,and have also seen many made by others.
00:41:02.830,00:41:05.820,有些事本想烂在肚子里,00:41:03.930,00:41:06.920,"There are things that I would let ""rot in my stomach."""
00:41:06.920,00:41:09.530,可是如今 姐姐刚回宫就遭人暗算,00:41:08.020,00:41:10.768,"But you were targeted by someone
soon after your return."
00:41:10.380,00:41:12.210,叫妹妹如何敢再隐瞒,00:41:11.480,00:41:13.160,How could I hold it back from you now?
00:41:13.420,00:41:15.210,昔日之错已经铸成,00:41:14.400,00:41:16.655,The mistakes I made in the past are now cast in stone.
00:41:16.090,00:41:20.430,陵容只希望在今日能稍稍弥补,00:41:17.120,00:41:21.264,I only wish to make some compensations today.
00:41:20.930,00:41:24.350,妹妹这话我就不知从何听起了,00:41:21.920,00:41:25.320,I don’t know ... how I should consider this.
00:41:25.690,00:41:29.350,皇上眼中的妹妹是最温顺安静的,00:41:26.760,00:41:28.285,"In His Majesty's eyes,"
,,,00:41:28.600,00:41:30.443,you are the quietest and most obedient one.
00:41:30.570,00:41:32.850,怎么妹妹从前,00:41:31.480,00:41:32.880,Are you saying that
00:41:33.240,00:41:34.690,也做过什么见不得人的错事,00:41:32.880,00:41:35.800,you have also had underhanded dealings in the past?
00:41:35.150,00:41:37.990,姐姐这话便是不肯原谅陵容了,00:41:36.080,00:41:39.000,"If you say that, does that mean you are
 unwilling to forgive me?"
00:41:39.490,00:41:42.110,宫中人心如何分辨我实在不懂,00:41:40.480,00:41:43.083,I don’t know how to read minds in the palace.
00:41:43.660,00:41:44.700,可是陵容,00:41:44.760,00:41:46.080,"However, Lingrong,"
00:41:45.500,00:41:49.120,咱们到底也是这么多年的姐妹了,00:41:46.378,00:41:50.000,we have known each other like sisters for so many years.
00:41:50.090,00:41:52.750,我这辈子的罪孽是赎不清了,00:41:51.120,00:41:53.680,"I will never be able to do enough penance
for my sins in this life."
00:41:53.920,00:41:56.670,只希望姐姐能平平安安诞下龙胎,00:41:55.020,00:41:57.770,"I only hope you can give birth to the imperial heir
safe and sound."
00:42:00.350,00:42:02.010,姐姐万事多加小心,00:42:01.320,00:42:03.164,Please be extra careful about everything.
00:42:04.480,00:42:05.460,好香啊,00:42:05.358,00:42:06.730,What a nice fragrance.
00:42:10.190,00:42:11.800,这是欣贵人送我的香囊,00:42:11.068,00:42:12.923,Lady Joie gave me this sachet.
00:42:12.610,00:42:13.890,姐姐喜欢这味道吗,00:42:13.600,00:42:15.086,Do you like the scent?
00:42:15.700,00:42:16.900,你的心意我明白了,00:42:16.578,00:42:18.151,I understand what you mean.
00:42:17.820,00:42:18.810,我自会小心,00:42:18.640,00:42:20.000,I will be careful.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.100,00:43:00.100,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.100,00:43:20.100,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.100,00:43:37.100,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.100,00:43:55.100,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.100,00:44:03.100,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."

like flowers swept away in the wind."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.100,00:44:34.100,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
