00:02:23.440,00:02:25.790,皇后娘娘也不必费事瞧了,00:02:24.380,00:02:26.900,"There is no need to review it, Your Majesty."
00:02:26.120,00:02:27.070,这一个月来,,,
00:02:27.360,00:02:29.550,皇上除了在景仁宫两三日外,00:02:27.120,00:02:30.440,"For the past month, His Majesty
has stayed exclusively with Noble Lady An"
00:02:29.960,00:02:31.990,其余的全是安贵人,00:02:30.980,00:02:33.200,except for a couple of times with Your Majesty.
00:02:34.240,00:02:35.990,什么小门小户的出身,,,
00:02:36.320,00:02:38.230,刚进宫多久就封了贵人,00:02:35.380,00:02:37.140,What a humble family she comes from!
00:02:38.600,00:02:39.740,凭她也配,00:02:37.260,00:02:41.000,Why did she get the title of Noble Lady in just a year?
00:02:40.960,00:02:42.070,安贵人哪,00:02:41.980,00:02:43.420,Noble Lady An ...
00:02:43.680,00:02:46.190,这俗话说老鸨挑了高枝,00:02:44.660,00:02:47.480,"is ""an old crow that jumped to a high branch""."
00:02:47.520,00:02:49.150,安贵人出身再低,,,
00:02:49.400,00:02:50.950,好歹也是个官家女儿,00:02:48.600,00:02:52.160,"Lady An's family is humble,
but at least her father is an official."
00:02:51.760,00:02:54.630,先帝爷的良妃是辛者库贱奴,00:02:52.720,00:02:55.520,The prior emperor's Consort Liang was a slave
00:02:54.920,00:02:56.390,还不是一样封妃,00:02:55.840,00:02:57.760,before she became a Consort.
00:02:56.840,00:02:58.110,这你就不知道了,00:02:57.840,00:02:59.200,"You might not be aware, but"
00:02:58.720,00:03:00.910,这小户啊 有小户的好处,00:02:59.800,00:03:01.920,humble women have their own skills.
00:03:01.200,00:03:03.150,一水儿的做那低声下气的事儿,00:03:02.240,00:03:04.060,They know how to do the humble things
00:03:03.560,00:03:04.910,咱们学还学不会呢,00:03:04.420,00:03:06.160,which we can't learn to do.
00:03:05.680,00:03:07.870,你们在说什么这么高兴啊,00:03:06.560,00:03:09.280,You two seem very happy. What are you talking about?
00:03:08.800,00:03:10.430,正说这几日虽热,00:03:09.560,00:03:11.620,"We were saying that although it's been hot during the day,"
00:03:10.760,00:03:13.030,晚上起了风倒也凉凉的呢,00:03:11.660,00:03:13.800,the wind is very cooling in the evenings.
00:03:13.280,00:03:14.260,暑热将尽,,,
00:03:14.480,00:03:16.470,有风自然凉爽惬意,00:03:14.060,00:03:17.240,"It is nice to have the cooling wind
when the summer is about to end."
00:03:17.040,00:03:18.710,只是耳边风吹过,,,
00:03:18.960,00:03:20.630,有几句吹到心里头,00:03:18.040,00:03:21.260,"But when the wind blows over the ears into the heart,"
00:03:20.880,00:03:22.310,听了却心寒哪,00:03:21.720,00:03:23.400,it makes the heart cold.
00:03:24.080,00:03:27.030,皇上痛失两子 伤心难抑,00:03:25.140,00:03:28.220,His Majesty has been grieved by the loss of two children.
00:03:27.960,00:03:30.790,各位妹妹与本宫一同侍奉皇上,00:03:29.020,00:03:32.080,"Since we are all in service to His Majesty,"
00:03:31.720,00:03:34.870,之前可有良策使皇上高兴啊,00:03:32.720,00:03:36.300,did anyone come up with a good idea to lighten his spirits?
00:03:36.000,00:03:37.870,宴饮本宫安排过,00:03:36.840,00:03:38.560,I arranged a banquet
00:03:38.120,00:03:39.870,祝酒你们自己也去过,00:03:38.820,00:03:40.580,and you made your toasts.
00:03:40.480,00:03:41.870,皇上都郁郁不乐,,,
00:03:42.440,00:03:43.910,你们都无法可施,00:03:41.440,00:03:43.120,"However, His Majesty was still dispirited."
00:03:44.760,00:03:46.230,现在总算有人,00:03:43.360,00:03:45.180,And all of you were at your wits' end.
00:03:46.480,00:03:48.510,能真皇上好解心结了,00:03:45.600,00:03:49.040,Now finally someone relieved the pain in His Majesty's heart.
00:03:48.840,00:03:50.190,你们应该高兴,00:03:49.780,00:03:51.140,You should be happy about it
00:03:50.440,00:03:52.390,而不是背地里诸多非议,00:03:51.380,00:03:53.380,instead of gossiping privately.
00:03:53.840,00:03:55.830,安贵人出身是不够荣耀,00:03:54.840,00:03:56.840,Noble Lady An does not have a glorious background.
00:03:56.040,00:03:57.710,可如今皇上喜欢她,00:03:56.920,00:03:58.880,"But now His Majesty favors her,"
00:03:58.120,00:03:59.950,也就等于本宫喜欢她,00:03:59.180,00:04:01.040,and that means she's also in my favor.
00:04:00.520,00:04:02.150,平时你们争风吃醋,,,
00:04:02.360,00:04:03.950,本宫都睁一只眼闭一只眼,00:04:01.500,00:04:05.740,I would normally turn a blind eye to jealousy in the harem.
00:04:04.240,00:04:05.150,只当不知道,,,
00:04:06.240,00:04:08.830,可眼下她是皇上心尖儿上的人,00:04:07.240,00:04:09.840,But right now she is at the very center of His Majesty's heart.
00:04:09.520,00:04:10.910,你们要是和她过不去,00:04:10.400,00:04:11.960,"If you cause her trouble,"
00:04:11.200,00:04:12.910,便是和本宫和皇上过不去,00:04:12.120,00:04:14.000,you will trouble both myself and His Majesty.
00:04:13.880,00:04:14.790,知道了吗,00:04:14.800,00:04:16.120,Is that understood?
00:04:16.360,00:04:17.750,臣妾不敢,00:04:17.400,00:04:19.080,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:04:19.440,00:04:20.500,你们都坐下吧,00:04:20.400,00:04:21.460,Sit down.
00:04:21.120,00:04:21.990,是,00:04:22.100,00:04:23.280,Yes.
00:04:23.240,00:04:25.350,安贵人的性子和婉谦卑,00:04:24.160,00:04:26.620,Lady An is modest and mild-mannered.
00:04:25.920,00:04:27.390,最适合在这个时候,,,
00:04:27.640,00:04:29.270,安抚皇上失子之痛,00:04:26.860,00:04:30.240,She is the best person to soothe His Majesty's aching heart.
00:04:30.520,00:04:32.270,向来这女人的温柔,,,
00:04:32.480,00:04:35.150,是抚平男人伤痛的一剂良药啊,00:04:31.400,00:04:35.560,"The tenderness in a woman is always
the medicine for a man's sorrow."
00:04:36.040,00:04:38.110,你们若真的心里那么难受,00:04:36.880,00:04:39.080,"If you are truly upset by it,"
00:04:38.760,00:04:41.710,就只当皇上是在上药罢了,00:04:39.660,00:04:42.640,just think of it as medicine for His Majesty.
00:04:42.680,00:04:45.350,皇后娘娘伺候皇上身边多年,00:04:43.480,00:04:46.160,Your Majesty has long served His Majesty
00:04:45.640,00:04:46.310,自然知道,,,
00:04:46.520,00:04:49.350,什么样的人服侍皇上最真妥当,00:04:46.620,00:04:50.140,and knows who is the best to soothe His Majesty.
00:04:49.840,00:04:51.990,臣妾们不敢有异议,00:04:50.700,00:04:52.860,We concubines will not quibble.
00:04:52.240,00:04:53.750,本宫也是没有办法,00:04:53.140,00:04:54.680,I was out of ideas.
00:04:54.120,00:04:55.630,若你们一个个都济事,,,
00:04:56.000,00:04:57.710,人人都能讨皇上喜欢,00:04:55.060,00:04:58.440,"If any of you had been able to gain His Majesty's interest,"
00:04:58.000,00:04:59.990,本宫又何必费这番心思呢,00:04:58.900,00:05:01.380,I wouldn't have troubled myself to arrange Lady An's performance!
00:05:01.160,00:05:03.110,如今淳贵人没了,00:05:02.100,00:05:04.060,"Now that Noble Lady Chun is gone,"
00:05:03.560,00:05:05.350,年妃又失了皇上的欢心,00:05:04.540,00:05:06.420,"and Consort Nian has lost His Majesty's favor,"
00:05:06.000,00:05:07.870,富察贵人和莞嫔的身子,,,
00:05:08.160,00:05:09.110,也没有好全,00:05:06.880,00:05:10.600,"and Noble Lady Fuca and Concubine Sourire haven't fully recovered from their miscarriages,"
00:05:10.840,00:05:12.190,这妃嫔凋零,00:05:11.820,00:05:13.420,The harem is fading.
00:05:12.680,00:05:14.750,真的是劳师动众去选秀,,,
00:05:15.360,00:05:16.870,又一时添了新人,00:05:13.580,00:05:17.720,"But if we were to bring in hundreds of
candidates for a concubine selection,"
00:05:17.160,00:05:18.870,你们这心里更是不肯了,00:05:18.120,00:05:19.660,you would only be more upset.
00:05:19.120,00:05:19.910,娘娘说的是,00:05:19.840,00:05:21.280,Your Majesty is right.
00:05:20.400,00:05:22.510,臣妾们绝对不会真难安妹妹的,00:05:21.400,00:05:23.500,We will never be hard on Lingrong.
00:05:23.320,00:05:25.030,只要安妹妹侍奉妥当,,,
00:05:25.280,00:05:26.710,皇上开心就好,00:05:24.120,00:05:27.860,As long as His Majesty is happy with Lingrong's service.
00:05:27.760,00:05:28.510,莞嫔哪,,,
00:05:28.760,00:05:30.750,安贵人的事你别往心里去,00:05:28.780,00:05:31.860,"Concubine Sourire, don't take it as a personal affront."
00:05:31.240,00:05:33.270,皇上总要有人陪伴的,00:05:32.280,00:05:34.240,His Majesty needs company.
00:05:33.920,00:05:35.990,难得你同安贵人又亲厚,00:05:34.940,00:05:37.180,I'm glad that you are close with Noble Lady An.
00:05:36.560,00:05:37.910,本宫也只是瞧着她,,,
00:05:38.240,00:05:39.670,能真皇上解忧罢了,00:05:37.560,00:05:40.620,I hope she can assuage His Majesty's grief.
00:05:40.280,00:05:43.590,本宫做一切事都是真了皇上着想,00:05:41.280,00:05:44.580,Everything I have done is for His Majesty.
00:05:46.840,00:05:47.790,娘娘言重了,,,
00:05:48.640,00:05:49.780,只要是真了皇上,00:05:47.840,00:05:49.280,Your Majesty need not say that.
00:05:50.400,00:05:51.540,臣妾不觉得委屈,00:05:49.680,00:05:51.220,Your Majesty did it for His Majesty.
,,,00:05:51.360,00:05:53.040,I don't feel there was an injustice.
00:05:52.400,00:05:54.230,本宫知道你最得大体,00:05:53.340,00:05:55.000,I know you always see the big picture
00:05:54.480,00:05:55.750,皇上一直喜欢你,00:05:55.200,00:05:56.900,and that His Majesty favors you.
00:05:56.280,00:05:58.910,可本宫瞧着你这样思念那孩子,00:05:57.340,00:05:59.880,"But I see you mourning for your unborn child,"
00:05:59.640,00:06:01.070,身体也不是很好,00:06:00.600,00:06:02.320,and your health not improving ...
00:06:02.200,00:06:05.190,皇上身边是不能缺了服侍的人的,00:06:03.280,00:06:06.140,There should always be someone serving His Majesty.
00:06:05.560,00:06:07.150,你还是好好调养好身子,,,
00:06:07.480,00:06:09.150,再服侍皇上也不迟啊,00:06:06.540,00:06:09.760,You must restore your health before you can serve His Majesty again.
00:06:09.440,00:06:11.510,臣妾谨记皇后娘娘之命,00:06:10.360,00:06:12.640,I will obey Your Majesty's order.
00:06:12.240,00:06:14.070,年氏的事叫你委屈了,00:06:13.140,00:06:15.420,I sympathize over the injustices you suffered because of Consort Nian.
00:06:14.560,00:06:17.230,太后知道你小崖后非常惋惜,00:06:15.600,00:06:17.940,The Empress Dowager also grieves for your loss.
00:06:17.440,00:06:19.430,听说今日太后精神好了很多,00:06:18.240,00:06:20.520,I heard that Her Majesty has been feeling much better today.
00:06:19.960,00:06:21.070,你便去问安吧,00:06:20.940,00:06:22.360,You should pay your respects to her.
00:06:22.440,00:06:22.990,是,00:06:23.400,00:06:24.280,Yes.
00:06:28.760,00:06:29.980,莞嫔妹妹留步,00:06:29.800,00:06:31.160,Sourire.
00:06:30.760,00:06:31.900,富察贵人有什么事吗,00:06:31.620,00:06:33.120,"How can I help you, Lady Fuca?"
00:06:32.240,00:06:34.070,妹妹的气色好多了,00:06:33.220,00:06:35.060,You look much better now.
00:06:34.840,00:06:37.630,可见安贵人与妹妹姐妹情深,00:06:35.740,00:06:38.520,"That is because of Lady An, isn't it?"
00:06:37.920,00:06:39.270,她那一边得宠,,,
00:06:39.600,00:06:41.030,你的气色也好多了呀,00:06:39.040,00:06:40.440,"When she gains favor,"
00:06:42.600,00:06:43.550,可不是吗,00:06:40.520,00:06:42.000,it should lift your spirits also.
00:06:43.920,00:06:44.790,这姐妹俩,,,
00:06:45.000,00:06:47.030,就是要互相提携提携的,00:06:43.560,00:06:47.640,"That's how sisters help each other, isn't it?"
00:06:47.320,00:06:48.830,妹妹还要去向太后问安,00:06:48.180,00:06:49.960,I am on my way to pay respects to the Empress Dowager.
00:06:49.400,00:06:50.270,先走一步了,00:06:50.400,00:06:51.680,I take my leave now.
00:06:52.040,00:06:54.230,莞嫔妹妹真是贵人事忙啊,00:06:53.100,00:06:55.320,"""A distinguished person is always busy."""
00:06:54.880,00:06:57.590,见不着皇上 见见太后也是好的,00:06:55.960,00:06:58.480,"You cannot see His Majesty
but you can see the Empress Dowager."
00:06:58.320,00:06:59.830,可真是孝顺啊,00:06:59.200,00:07:00.940,You really are a devoted concubine.
00:07:00.280,00:07:02.070,姐姐我可就比不上了,00:07:01.240,00:07:03.240,I cannot compare to you.
00:07:03.280,00:07:05.270,我与姐姐向来井水不犯河水,00:07:04.160,00:07:07.220,"I’ve always stayed out of your way
“like the well water stays out of the river”."
00:07:06.480,00:07:07.510,何故今日这样,,,
00:07:08.200,00:07:09.750,字字讥讽 不肯放过,00:07:07.460,00:07:08.980,"Why, today,"
,,,00:07:09.160,00:07:11.340,are you making such snide comments?
00:07:10.600,00:07:12.430,你我都是侍候皇上的人,00:07:11.540,00:07:13.400,We both serve His Majesty.
00:07:12.960,00:07:14.470,我怎会不放过妹妹,00:07:13.800,00:07:15.800,Why would I find fault with you?
00:07:15.480,00:07:16.430,我只是觉得,00:07:16.560,00:07:17.780,I just thought that
00:07:16.680,00:07:19.110,莞嫔与安贵人交好人人都知道,00:07:17.840,00:07:20.180,"since everyone knows Lady An is very close to you,"
00:07:19.640,00:07:21.430,这回如此费尽心思,,,
00:07:21.720,00:07:24.070,请皇后出面安排她亲近皇上,00:07:20.460,00:07:25.360,"it was surely your idea. And you sought Her
 Majesty's help in your effort to please His Majesty."
00:07:24.880,00:07:27.110,妹妹可真是足智多谋啊,00:07:25.840,00:07:28.380,"You always seem to have some
clever tricks up your sleeve."
00:07:28.480,00:07:29.390,不过也是,00:07:29.400,00:07:30.800,I think I understand this one.
00:07:29.800,00:07:32.230,妹妹如此费心帮衬安贵人,00:07:30.900,00:07:33.340,"Since you've done all you can to advance Lady An,"
00:07:32.560,00:07:34.310,想必她将来有了孩子,00:07:33.640,00:07:35.160,"if she has a child one day,"
00:07:34.600,00:07:35.790,便是你的孩子,00:07:35.220,00:07:36.960,it will be your child as well.
00:07:36.960,00:07:38.350,妹妹又何必愁,,,
00:07:38.640,00:07:40.550,保不住眼前的这一胎呢,00:07:38.000,00:07:42.140,"In that case, losing your own child won't matter anymore."
00:07:42.840,00:07:44.790,我本以真和姐姐是同病相怜,00:07:43.860,00:07:46.260,I thought we could commiserate with each other for the same loss.
00:07:46.040,00:07:47.590,原来姐姐是个事过境迁,,,
00:07:48.200,00:07:49.340,转眼忘怀的人,00:07:46.960,00:07:49.900,It turns out that you have already forgotten your pain.
00:07:49.520,00:07:50.070,你,,,
00:07:50.320,00:07:51.030,富察小主,00:07:50.220,00:07:51.000,You ...
,,,00:07:51.180,00:07:52.300,Noble Lady Fuca.
00:07:51.400,00:07:53.390,方才走的是先秦淑女的步伐吗,00:07:52.360,00:07:54.020,"Have you been imitating the walk
of the ladies from early Qin Dynasty?"
00:07:56.280,00:07:57.340,难真安贵人,,,
00:07:57.600,00:07:59.790,也识得这是先秦淑女的步伐,00:07:57.060,00:08:00.400,I didn't expect Lady An to recognize this style of walking.
00:08:00.240,00:08:03.030,一向还以真你孤陋寡闻了呢,00:08:01.020,00:08:03.820,I always thought you were an uneducated person.
00:08:03.320,00:08:05.510,妹妹听闻姐姐为博皇上一笑,,,
00:08:06.240,00:08:06.990,特意学了这种,,,
00:08:07.280,00:08:10.110,据说是先秦淑女的步伐来行走,00:08:04.080,00:08:10.780,"I heard that you practiced this way of walking
 specifically to perform for His Majesty."
00:08:10.880,00:08:13.510,据说行走时可以如弱柳扶风,00:08:11.800,00:08:15.720,The ladies in Qin Dynasty walked like  graceful willows swaying in the breeze.
00:08:13.960,00:08:14.940,十分婀娜,,,
00:08:15.720,00:08:17.230,果真百闻不如一见,00:08:16.460,00:08:18.480,Today I've seen how it looks.
00:08:17.840,00:08:18.630,妹妹相信,,,
00:08:19.320,00:08:21.110,只消皇上一见姐姐步态,00:08:18.800,00:08:20.040,I believe that
00:08:21.640,00:08:22.990,一定会喜而忘忧,00:08:20.240,00:08:23.880,His Majesty will leave his sadness behind  when he sees you walk.
00:08:23.920,00:08:26.750,没想到在皇上身边几日的工夫,00:08:24.920,00:08:28.920,"I didn't expect your tastes to elevate so quickly
after serving His Majesty for just a few days."
00:08:27.160,00:08:28.190,懂得赏识了,,,
00:08:28.760,00:08:29.430,是啊,00:08:29.540,00:08:30.520,Yes.
00:08:29.960,00:08:32.590,上回皇上说宫中的戏子不好,00:08:30.740,00:08:33.600,His Majesty was just saying the opera house
00:08:33.240,00:08:35.310,有几出戏演得武差,00:08:34.200,00:08:36.220,interpreted some of the classics terribly.
00:08:35.960,00:08:37.550,一出叫邯郸学步,00:08:36.960,00:08:39.200,"One was ""Copy the Way They Walk in Handan"""
00:08:38.520,00:08:41.150,另一出叫东施效擎,00:08:39.500,00:08:42.340,"and the other was ""The Ugly Dongshi Imitating the Beautiful Xishi""."
00:08:42.560,00:08:43.430,如今一看,,,
00:08:43.880,00:08:44.990,姐姐演得最好,00:08:43.360,00:08:44.640,Now that I see
00:08:45.760,00:08:47.830,皇上见了可不是要喜而忘忧吗,00:08:44.800,00:08:46.580,"that your act is better than
those performers,"
00:08:48.320,00:08:49.380,你胆敢讽刺我,00:08:46.640,00:08:49.100,"I think His Majesty will forget his
disappointment in them when he sees you."
00:08:49.880,00:08:51.310,妹妹怎敢讽刺姐姐,00:08:49.260,00:08:50.860,How dare you make fun of me?
00:08:52.160,00:08:53.630,只是皇后娘娘说了,00:08:50.860,00:08:52.280,I dare not.
00:08:54.320,00:08:55.590,只要皇上高兴,00:08:53.000,00:08:55.000,"But just as Her Majesty said,"
00:08:55.920,00:08:57.510,诸位姐妹学什么都好,00:08:55.440,00:08:58.880,"it doesn't matter what we learn,
as long as it lifts His Majesty's spirits."
00:08:58.360,00:08:59.230,姐姐学步,,,
00:08:59.840,00:09:01.430,可不是真了皇上高兴吗,00:08:59.120,00:09:02.520,Isn't that why you learned to walk like that?
00:09:02.240,00:09:03.510,皇后娘娘知道了,,,
00:09:04.120,00:09:05.430,肯定也会高兴的,00:09:03.160,00:09:06.640,Her Majesty will be pleased once she knows about this.
00:09:07.160,00:09:08.550,你以真皇后喜欢你吗,00:09:08.020,00:09:10.080,Do you really think the Empress likes you?
00:09:09.600,00:09:11.790,不过拿你当一贴狗皮膏药罢了,00:09:10.700,00:09:12.800,"She's just using you as ""dog skin plaster"" on a wound."
00:09:12.080,00:09:13.190,你别得意忘形,00:09:13.060,00:09:14.200,Don’t be so full of yourself!
00:09:13.400,00:09:16.230,狗皮膏药只要有用处也是好的,00:09:14.360,00:09:17.140,The plaster is useful if it works.
00:09:17.440,00:09:21.350,怕就怕是张烂狗皮,00:09:18.520,00:09:19.820,"But unfortunately,"
,,,00:09:21.200,00:09:22.980,"if you use a rotten plaster,"
00:09:22.280,00:09:24.550,到哪儿都招人嫌弃,00:09:23.200,00:09:25.640,the wound will stink and people will avoid you.
00:09:36.760,00:09:37.820,姐姐真我受委屈,,,
00:09:38.160,00:09:38.990,陵容来迟了,00:09:37.680,00:09:39.020,Sorry that I came late.
00:09:39.560,00:09:40.230,没什么,00:09:39.180,00:09:40.380,You had to endure that because of me.
,,,00:09:40.560,00:09:41.840,It was nothing.
00:09:41.560,00:09:43.230,我本不该和她一般见识,00:09:42.660,00:09:44.520,I shouldn’t have responded to her.
00:09:45.080,00:09:46.750,从前都是我真你解围,00:09:46.160,00:09:48.120,I was always the one to help you out.
00:09:47.920,00:09:48.980,如今也换过来了,,,
00:09:50.080,00:09:51.110,姐姐这是怪我,00:09:48.920,00:09:50.220,Now things have changed.
00:09:51.720,00:09:52.860,要和我生分了吗,00:09:51.160,00:09:53.800,"Are you blaming me, Sourire?"
00:09:54.640,00:09:55.430,你别多心,00:09:55.660,00:09:57.000,I'm not.
00:09:56.400,00:09:58.310,姐姐是怪我事前没有告诉你吗,00:09:57.440,00:09:59.700,Do you blame me for not telling you about it?
00:10:00.520,00:10:01.910,可是这事本仓促,00:10:01.580,00:10:03.260,It was all planned at the last minute.
00:10:03.000,00:10:05.750,皇后娘娘又叮嘱了要让皇上高兴,00:10:04.060,00:10:07.180,"Her Majesty urged me not to tell
anyone in order to surprise His Majesty,"
00:10:06.760,00:10:08.230,绝不能走漏半点风声,00:10:07.820,00:10:09.680,and lighten his spirits.
00:10:10.160,00:10:12.830,陵容卑微 怎敢违抗,00:10:11.220,00:10:14.100,I was not in a position to disobey Her Majesty.
00:10:14.680,00:10:16.110,何况我私心想着,00:10:15.780,00:10:17.500,I also thought that
00:10:17.320,00:10:18.710,若我得皇上喜欢,00:10:18.280,00:10:20.120,"if His Majesty favored me,"
00:10:19.480,00:10:20.910,也能帮衬上姐姐一把了,00:10:20.440,00:10:22.460,"it would be helpful to you, too."
00:10:22.360,00:10:23.990,姐姐就不用那样辛苦,00:10:23.500,00:10:25.240,Things would be better for you.
00:10:25.480,00:10:26.190,陵容,00:10:26.460,00:10:27.560,Lingrong.
00:10:28.240,00:10:30.110,你的咳疾好了也该告诉我一声,00:10:29.280,00:10:31.800,You should have let me know that your throat had recovered.
00:10:31.600,00:10:32.470,叫我担心,00:10:32.500,00:10:33.980,"It worried me,"
00:10:33.800,00:10:34.710,也叫我意外,00:10:34.720,00:10:36.140,and took me by surprise.
00:10:39.640,00:10:41.910,姐姐不是不明白身不由己的事,00:10:40.640,00:10:43.200,You understand - there are orders we obey even if unwillingly.
00:10:43.480,00:10:44.910,陵容身似蒲柳,,,
00:10:46.200,00:10:47.180,所有这一切,00:10:44.640,00:10:46.960,"Just like bulrushes which perish in autumn,"
00:10:48.400,00:10:51.790,不过是成也歌喉 败也歌喉而已,00:10:47.300,00:10:52.240,the favor I gain will last only as long as my voice.
00:10:57.280,00:10:58.310,好了 好了,00:10:58.360,00:10:59.660,I understand.
00:10:59.360,00:11:01.150,宫中人人都有自己的不得已,00:11:00.420,00:11:02.280,Everyone in the palace has to act contrary to their feelings sometimes.
00:11:01.640,00:11:02.310,我知道,00:11:02.740,00:11:03.780,I know.
00:11:05.760,00:11:07.310,富察贵人惹我生气,00:11:06.840,00:11:08.400,Lady Fuca made me angry
00:11:08.280,00:11:09.500,我倒招你伤心了,00:11:09.280,00:11:10.860,but I made you sad.
00:11:14.120,00:11:14.950,你要再哭,,,
00:11:15.600,00:11:16.790,我只能陪着你一起哭了,00:11:15.000,00:11:16.500,"If you keep crying,"
,,,00:11:16.660,00:11:18.300,I will be crying with you.
00:11:28.600,00:11:30.030,臣妾给太后请安,,,
00:11:30.440,00:11:31.710,太后万福金安,00:11:29.740,00:11:32.900,"I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
Peace and grace to Your Majesty."
00:11:32.720,00:11:33.750,你们先下去吧,,,
00:11:34.120,00:11:34.710,是,00:11:33.660,00:11:34.780,You two may leave.
,,,00:11:35.160,00:11:36.300,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:11:41.080,00:11:43.950,来 坐哀家跟前说话,00:11:42.060,00:11:44.520,Come sit next to me.
00:11:44.920,00:11:45.790,谢太后,00:11:45.980,00:11:47.520,I thank Your Majesty.
00:11:55.840,00:11:56.980,世兰那孩子,,,
00:11:57.880,00:11:59.790,哀家本来瞧着还不错,00:11:56.820,00:12:00.480,I used to think highly of Shilan.
00:12:00.800,00:12:02.230,很利落的一个孩子,00:12:01.880,00:12:03.400,She has a decisive mind
00:12:02.880,00:12:03.940,相貌又好,00:12:03.920,00:12:05.300,and a beautiful face.
00:12:05.200,00:12:07.190,不过就是脾气骄纵了些,00:12:06.240,00:12:08.460,"True, her temper tantrums were indulged."
00:12:08.600,00:12:09.710,那也难免,,,
00:12:10.040,00:12:11.550,世家出来的孩子嘛,00:12:09.620,00:12:12.580,"But that is understandable for someone
who comes from a distinguished family."
00:12:13.320,00:12:17.470,如今看来竟然如此狠毒,00:12:14.440,00:12:16.200,I never knew that
,,,00:12:16.800,00:12:18.460,she was such a vicious woman.
00:12:20.920,00:12:22.270,哀家是老了,00:12:22.020,00:12:23.380,I’m aging
00:12:24.080,00:12:25.140,精力不济,00:12:25.120,00:12:26.520,and my energy wanes.
00:12:26.480,00:12:27.460,所有的事,,,
00:12:28.400,00:12:30.860,都一窝蜂地交给皇后去管着,00:12:27.600,00:12:31.560,I handed everything over to the Empress.
00:12:32.040,00:12:33.390,也是皇后无用,,,
00:12:33.760,00:12:35.830,才会生出这许多的事端,00:12:33.140,00:12:36.560,It is because of her incompetence that all of this has happened.
00:12:37.240,00:12:38.830,宫中的事千头万绪,00:12:38.320,00:12:40.160,Palace affairs are like intertwined threads.
00:12:39.640,00:12:41.030,皇后娘娘也顾不过来,00:12:40.600,00:12:42.440,It is hard for Her Majesty to manage alone.
00:12:41.800,00:12:44.750,还请太后不要怪及皇后娘娘,00:12:42.900,00:12:45.680,I hope Your Majesty will not blame Her Majesty.
00:12:45.920,00:12:47.030,你这孩子,,,
00:12:47.400,00:12:48.870,还顾着别人哪,00:12:46.960,00:12:50.020,"You're still worried about the others, Sourire."
00:12:52.200,00:12:54.760,瞧你这脸上一点血色都没有,,,
00:12:55.320,00:12:56.460,人这样憔悴,00:12:53.340,00:12:57.480,"Your face looks pale, devoid of your usual rosy glow."
00:12:57.520,00:12:58.790,想必还在真那个,,,
00:12:59.040,00:13:01.230,白白没有了的孩子在伤心呢,00:12:58.540,00:13:02.260,You must still be grieving your unfortunate child.
00:13:03.240,00:13:04.790,你年轻不经事,00:13:04.260,00:13:06.240,You are still young and new to the palace.
00:13:06.280,00:13:09.590,女人的容颜比树上的花凋得还快,00:13:07.360,00:13:13.000,The face of a woman fades faster than the flowers.
00:13:10.720,00:13:12.350,一点也经不得老,,,
00:13:13.640,00:13:17.990,老了再好的容颜都没了样子,00:13:14.600,00:13:18.960,"Even the most beautiful face cannot
withstand the passing of time."
00:13:19.280,00:13:21.910,想要回头谈何容易啊,00:13:20.280,00:13:22.980,There will be no turning back to youth.
00:13:24.800,00:13:25.860,这些日子,,,
00:13:26.880,00:13:29.230,你只顾着自己的丧子之痛,00:13:25.880,00:13:30.060,"For some time, you've been wallowing in your grief."
00:13:30.080,00:13:31.300,你想过皇帝吗,00:13:31.000,00:13:32.760,Have you thought about how this makes the Emperor feel?
00:13:32.600,00:13:34.270,若你没有想着皇帝,00:13:33.620,00:13:35.320,"If you're not thinking about him,"
00:13:35.120,00:13:38.390,这次你没有了的只是个孩子,00:13:36.220,00:13:39.760,"you've lost only a child's life this time,"
00:13:39.960,00:13:43.310,下一回便是你自己,00:13:41.000,00:13:44.200,"next time, you could lose your own."
00:13:47.160,00:13:47.990,臣妾知罪,00:13:48.260,00:13:49.660,I recognize my offence.
00:13:49.480,00:13:50.950,别知罪不知罪的,00:13:50.540,00:13:52.020,It's not about that.
00:13:52.240,00:13:53.630,打理好自己,,,
00:13:54.000,00:13:55.190,再打理好皇帝,00:13:53.240,00:13:54.640,Take care of yourself
00:13:55.880,00:13:57.310,哀家才安心哪,00:13:55.000,00:13:56.520,and take care of the Emperor.
,,,00:13:56.900,00:13:58.640,That will relieve me of my worries.
00:13:58.520,00:13:59.110,是,00:13:59.500,00:14:00.700,Yes.
00:14:02.240,00:14:03.590,你先回去歇着吧,00:14:03.220,00:14:04.900,You should return and have a good rest.
00:14:05.160,00:14:06.380,听哀家的话,00:14:06.200,00:14:07.720,You need to listen to me.
00:14:07.080,00:14:08.270,别再伤心了,00:14:08.020,00:14:09.380,Don’t be sad anymore.
00:14:11.160,00:14:11.950,谢太后,00:14:12.180,00:14:13.600,I thank Your Majesty.
00:14:17.840,00:14:18.820,臣妾告退,,,
00:14:19.680,00:14:20.230,去吧,00:14:18.740,00:14:20.160,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:14:20.400,00:14:21.070,是,00:14:20.460,00:14:21.160,Proceed.
,,,00:14:21.320,00:14:22.520,Yes.
00:14:32.560,00:14:33.230,小主,,,
00:14:33.680,00:14:34.820,你怎么又写上了,00:14:33.500,00:14:34.420,"My Lady,"
00:14:37.880,00:14:39.100,太后 皇后教的,00:14:34.680,00:14:36.020,why are you writing?
00:14:39.520,00:14:40.550,写字能静心,00:14:38.740,00:14:40.440,The Empress Dowager and the Empress taught me
,,,00:14:40.540,00:14:42.280,that writing calms the heart.
00:14:48.120,00:14:49.150,外头乱哄哄的,,,
00:14:49.560,00:14:50.670,吊着嗓子唱个没完,00:14:49.180,00:14:50.380,It's too loud outside.
00:14:51.200,00:14:52.030,谁还能静心,00:14:50.460,00:14:52.980,How can anyone stay calm when she's trilling nonstop?
00:14:55.080,00:14:56.270,世上哪有那么多事情,,,
00:14:56.600,00:14:57.580,是可以阻挡的,00:14:56.040,00:14:58.620,There are so many things in the world that can't be stopped.
00:14:58.440,00:14:59.710,何况陵容的歌声,00:14:59.460,00:15:01.140,Especially Lingrong’s singing.
00:15:00.640,00:15:02.270,又岂是一扇门可以掩住的,00:15:01.500,00:15:03.280,It won't be blocked by a door.
00:15:02.840,00:15:04.550,小主的孩子没了那么多天了,00:15:03.740,00:15:05.400,"My Lady, ever since you lost your child,"
00:15:04.800,00:15:05.670,她来过几趟啊,,,
00:15:06.440,00:15:07.910,得了咳疾的时候来得少,00:15:05.720,00:15:06.980,how many times has she visited?
00:15:08.520,00:15:09.870,得了宠的时候来得更少,00:15:07.340,00:15:08.980,"She visited infrequently when she got the cough,"
00:15:10.520,00:15:11.550,只顾着自己唱歌,00:15:09.460,00:15:11.120,but even less now that she's in favor.
00:15:12.200,00:15:12.910,谁爱听啊,00:15:11.500,00:15:12.840,All she does is sing.
00:15:15.040,00:15:16.470,她失宠了这么些日子,00:15:13.180,00:15:14.400,I'm not listening!
00:15:17.400,00:15:18.620,好容易有了圣恩,00:15:16.040,00:15:17.840,She was out of favor for such a long time.
00:15:18.960,00:15:20.020,自然要以皇上真重,00:15:18.500,00:15:21.180,"Now that she has regained it, she must put His Majesty first."
00:15:21.760,00:15:23.550,来不来 原不在人,00:15:22.740,00:15:24.780,Being physically present is not important...
00:15:24.040,00:15:25.150,只在于心意,,,
00:15:25.720,00:15:26.860,浣碧 磨墨,00:15:24.940,00:15:26.540,It's the thought that matters.
,,,00:15:26.620,00:15:28.120,"Jade, grind the ink."
00:15:51.480,00:15:54.040,从前 皇上就在那西窗下,,,
00:15:54.840,00:15:56.310,和小主一起剪烛芯,00:15:53.780,00:15:57.800,"My Lady, His Majesty used to ""trim the candle
 wick at the west window"" with you."
00:15:58.480,00:15:59.670,你也会说从前了,00:15:59.460,00:16:01.340,"He ""used to"", as you said."
00:16:02.160,00:16:03.070,歌舞娱情,,,
00:16:03.880,00:16:05.310,自然不比诗书乏味,00:16:03.080,00:16:06.480,"Singing and dancing are more entertaining
than poetry and literature."
00:16:06.720,00:16:09.550,再好的书读熟了也会撂开一边,00:16:07.700,00:16:10.800,Even the best book will be put aside once you grow tired of it.
00:16:12.080,00:16:13.350,就好比这把扇子,00:16:13.060,00:16:14.700,Just like this fan.
00:16:14.680,00:16:17.240,天热的时候握在手里舍不得放下,00:16:15.680,00:16:18.840,"You're unwilling to put it down in the summer,"
00:16:18.640,00:16:22.150,一入了秋自然是碰也不愿碰了,00:16:19.660,00:16:22.960,but will not even touch it when autumn comes.
00:16:24.880,00:16:25.750,小主,,,
00:16:26.560,00:16:27.910,小主还念什么扇子呀,00:16:26.040,00:16:27.120,My Lady.
00:16:28.480,00:16:29.870,我跟浣碧是一样的心思,00:16:27.560,00:16:29.140,Why are you pitying this fan?
00:16:30.360,00:16:32.030,陵容小主的嗓音好得这么快,00:16:29.480,00:16:31.360,I have the same thoughts as Jade.
00:16:32.280,00:16:32.910,这么巧,,,
00:16:33.720,00:16:34.910,小主都不疑心吗,00:16:31.460,00:16:35.940,"Aren't you suspicious about the speed and
the timing of Lingrong's recovery?"
00:16:36.280,00:16:37.340,疑心又如何,00:16:37.340,00:16:39.040,So what if I am suspicious?
00:16:39.200,00:16:40.230,她正盛年,00:16:40.220,00:16:41.760,She's in her prime.
00:16:41.440,00:16:43.310,难道也要和我一样默默凋零,00:16:42.440,00:16:44.600,Why should she wither away like me?
00:16:44.840,00:16:47.220,寂寞空庭有我一个就已经够了,00:16:45.820,00:16:48.500,One lonely person is enough for my empty palace.
00:17:03.600,00:17:04.270,停,00:17:04.400,00:17:05.580,Stop.
00:17:06.000,00:17:06.910,皇上吉祥,00:17:07.020,00:17:08.620,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:17:08.720,00:17:10.510,这些日子不见你 你去哪里了,00:17:09.720,00:17:11.780,I haven't seen you in a while. What has been keeping you busy?
00:17:11.360,00:17:12.790,臣妾与敬妃娘娘,,,
00:17:13.080,00:17:14.710,主理宝华殿祝祷之事,00:17:12.260,00:17:15.740,"I have been assisting Consort Estime with
the prayer ceremonies at Baohua Hall"
00:17:14.960,00:17:17.390,所以一直未得空向皇上请安,00:17:15.800,00:17:18.460,so I have not had the time to pay respects to Your Majesty.
00:17:17.840,00:17:20.190,敬妃虽忙 朕倒见了她几面,00:17:18.820,00:17:21.080,"Although Consort Estime has been busy,
I have seen her a few times."
00:17:20.760,00:17:23.830,臣妾心中惦记着莞嫔所失的孩子,00:17:21.540,00:17:25.220,I've been concerned about Concubine Sourire's lost child.
00:17:24.360,00:17:25.710,除去祝祷之事,,,
00:17:26.080,00:17:28.670,臣妾还真这个孩子诵经祈福,00:17:25.340,00:17:29.420,"So I have also been praying for her child,"
00:17:29.120,00:17:31.580,祈祷他可以早日通往极乐,00:17:29.880,00:17:32.560,hoping her child will arrive soon at the Pure Land.
00:17:32.400,00:17:33.190,辛苦你了,00:17:33.260,00:17:34.980,That effort must have been hard on you.
00:17:33.960,00:17:36.870,臣妾再辛苦也是费力费神的事,00:17:35.000,00:17:38.040,It is only physical and mental labor for me.
00:17:37.880,00:17:40.990,莞嫔心里的苦才是说不出的,00:17:38.680,00:17:42.140,"But for Concubine Sourire, the emotional exhaustion is unbearable."
00:17:44.400,00:17:47.350,臣妾失言 还请皇上恕罪,00:17:45.460,00:17:47.980,I misspoke. I beg Your Majesty's pardon.
00:17:50.720,00:17:51.510,去碎玉轩,,,
00:17:52.160,00:17:52.790,皇上,00:17:51.680,00:17:53.180,To the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:17:53.080,00:17:55.310,您还得赶着去向太后请安呢,00:17:53.180,00:17:56.160,"Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager is expecting you."
00:17:56.400,00:17:58.030,朕放心不下莞嫔,00:17:57.460,00:17:59.600,I'm worried about Concubine Sourire.
00:17:59.400,00:18:01.390,碎玉轩 走,00:18:00.400,00:18:02.900,To the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:18:10.080,00:18:11.870,皇上驾到,00:18:11.060,00:18:12.860,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:18:14.800,00:18:15.630,皇上万安,,,
00:18:16.320,00:18:17.070,莞嫔呢,00:18:15.920,00:18:17.200,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:18:17.480,00:18:18.620,小主在里头睡着呢,00:18:17.320,00:18:18.380,Where is Concubine Sourire?
00:18:19.320,00:18:20.300,她可好些了吗,00:18:18.440,00:18:19.660,My Lady is sleeping in the chamber.
00:18:21.600,00:18:22.430,奴婢嘴笨,00:18:20.360,00:18:21.620,Is she feeling better?
00:18:22.840,00:18:24.230,皇上进去看看便知道了,00:18:22.640,00:18:23.860,I have an unintelligent tongue.
,,,00:18:23.860,00:18:25.580,Your Majesty will know once you see her.
00:19:11.040,00:19:12.590,你这样放不下孩子,00:19:11.960,00:19:13.960,You dwell on the child even when you sleep.
00:19:13.400,00:19:14.350,是在怨朕吗,00:19:14.240,00:19:16.040,Are you still aggrieved with me?
00:19:39.360,00:19:40.150,朕还有事,,,
00:19:41.480,00:19:42.540,莞嫔既睡着,00:19:39.840,00:19:41.600,I still have matters to attend to.
00:19:43.800,00:19:45.110,不必告诉她朕来过,00:19:42.420,00:19:46.080,"Since she's asleep, you don't need to tell her that I visited."
00:20:02.320,00:20:04.070,皇帝新得了安贵人,00:20:03.320,00:20:05.200,"Now that you have Lady An,"
00:20:04.720,00:20:06.350,怎么还是闷闷不乐呀,00:20:05.600,00:20:07.420,why do you still seem unhappy?
00:20:08.440,00:20:10.110,儿子刚去见了莞嫔,00:20:09.460,00:20:11.460,I went to check on Concubine Sourire just now.
00:20:11.760,00:20:13.270,她还是心结难解吗,00:20:12.580,00:20:14.720,She still hasn't gotten over the loss?
00:20:14.120,00:20:17.190,儿子不忍看到她伤心,00:20:15.060,00:20:18.500,I ... can't bear seeing her so sad;
00:20:17.720,00:20:19.150,也不愿看到她伤心,00:20:18.620,00:20:20.460,I don't want to see her like that.
00:20:20.840,00:20:24.110,她伤心儿子就忍不住动气,00:20:21.880,00:20:25.360,"When I see her unhappiness, it makes me angry."
00:20:25.040,00:20:25.710,气自己,00:20:26.040,00:20:27.240,I'm angry at myself
00:20:27.160,00:20:28.750,也气她让儿子动气,00:20:27.980,00:20:29.960,and angry at her for making me angry.
00:20:31.400,00:20:33.070,这就是莞嫔的不是了,00:20:32.300,00:20:33.980,Then she is at fault.
00:20:34.440,00:20:35.470,身真嫔妃,,,
00:20:36.000,00:20:37.750,一己之身有什么要紧,00:20:35.440,00:20:37.020,"As a concubine,"
00:20:38.280,00:20:40.150,侍奉君上才是最要紧,00:20:37.020,00:20:40.940,the emperor should matter more to her than herself.
00:20:41.760,00:20:44.470,也是你平常太宠爱她,00:20:42.680,00:20:45.320,You have been overly indulgent to her
00:20:45.200,00:20:46.030,纵坏她了,00:20:46.040,00:20:47.380,and spoiled her.
00:20:47.000,00:20:48.390,一直以真她懂事,00:20:48.040,00:20:49.920,I always thought she was more sensible than this.
00:20:49.640,00:20:50.620,既然如此,00:20:50.620,00:20:52.100,"If that's the case,"
00:20:51.240,00:20:53.510,不妨暂且不再去看她,00:20:52.140,00:20:54.880,why don't you stop visiting her for now?
00:20:54.840,00:20:55.980,她若有慧根,,,
00:20:56.600,00:20:58.150,自然会慢慢想明白的,00:20:55.780,00:20:59.260,"If she is wise, then she will come around."
00:20:58.920,00:21:00.270,儿子也是这么打算的,00:20:59.880,00:21:01.480,I was thinking the same.
00:21:02.640,00:21:04.590,等她自己懂事了再去看她,00:21:03.700,00:21:06.000,I'll visit her again once she has thought it through.
00:21:06.200,00:21:06.990,那就好,00:21:07.180,00:21:08.240,That's good.
00:21:08.640,00:21:10.790,让安贵人小心伺候着,00:21:09.580,00:21:11.740,Lady An will be devoted to your service.
00:21:11.240,00:21:12.790,你早些回养心殿吧,00:21:12.260,00:21:14.200,You should head back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation now.
00:21:13.960,00:21:15.150,那儿子先告退,00:21:14.900,00:21:16.220,Certainly.
00:21:16.280,00:21:18.110,明日再来给皇额娘请安,00:21:17.280,00:21:19.440,"I'll visit tomorrow, Imperial Mother."
00:21:24.320,00:21:26.430,皇上起驾,00:21:25.140,00:21:27.540,His Majesty departs.
00:21:31.560,00:21:33.710,太后不是挺喜欢莞嫔的吗,00:21:32.380,00:21:34.680,"Your Majesty, aren't you quite fond of Concubine Sourire?"
00:21:34.200,00:21:36.030,怎么也不帮着劝劝皇上,,,
00:21:36.800,00:21:38.470,还让皇上不去见她,00:21:35.140,00:21:39.420,Why did you advise His Majesty to not visit her?
00:21:39.960,00:21:42.590,哀家自己的儿子自己知道,00:21:40.940,00:21:43.700,I know my own son all too well.
00:21:44.000,00:21:46.790,皇帝是太在意莞嫔了,00:21:44.860,00:21:48.140,He cares too much about Concubine Sourire.
00:21:47.520,00:21:49.980,所以莞嫔伤心 他就气恼,00:21:48.540,00:21:51.280,That's why he gets upset when she's sad.
00:21:51.440,00:21:53.740,这归根到底呀 他是在恼自己,00:21:52.500,00:21:55.040,"Ultimately, he is just upset about himself."
00:21:55.480,00:21:57.390,如果再让他们两个见面,00:21:56.460,00:21:58.360,"If they keep seeing each other,"
00:21:58.320,00:22:00.990,只怕不知道会闹出些什么,00:21:59.220,00:22:03.200,I'm afraid it will create a permanent rift between them.
00:22:01.360,00:22:02.420,不能回头的事,,,
00:22:02.800,00:22:04.190,反而辜负了莞嫔,00:22:03.800,00:22:05.580,That would truly disappoint Concubine Sourire.
00:22:05.960,00:22:08.710,太后啊 还是心疼莞嫔,00:22:07.000,00:22:09.520,Your Majesty truly cares for Concubine Sourire.
00:22:12.560,00:22:14.710,皇帝可以有宠爱的人,00:22:13.640,00:22:15.860,An emperor is allowed to have a beloved concubine.
00:22:15.800,00:22:18.670,可是不能专宠 钟情,00:22:16.600,00:22:19.820,"He cannot, however, be exclusively devoted to just one concubine."
00:22:19.800,00:22:21.270,这会出大乱子的,00:22:20.760,00:22:22.780,That would bring chaos to the harem.
00:22:23.160,00:22:24.550,眼下年妃失宠,00:22:24.160,00:22:25.920,"Now that Consort Nian is out of favor,"
00:22:25.040,00:22:27.310,莞嫔如果因此独大,00:22:25.920,00:22:28.600,"if Concubine Sourire becomes the dominant concubine,"
00:22:27.800,00:22:29.470,后宫就会失去平衡,00:22:28.680,00:22:30.880,the harem will lose its balance.
00:22:30.600,00:22:33.750,况且莞嫔的性子也不够柔和,00:22:31.600,00:22:34.620,And her personality is not mild.
00:22:35.000,00:22:36.750,需要磨一磨才行,00:22:36.060,00:22:38.160,It's like a knife that needs to be blunted.
00:22:38.440,00:22:41.030,太后真是深谋远虑,00:22:39.500,00:22:42.100,Your Majesty is wise and farsighted.
00:22:43.240,00:22:44.910,什么深谋远虑啊,00:22:44.220,00:22:46.320,I don't see things more clearly than others.
00:22:46.040,00:22:47.180,不过是比别人,,,
00:22:47.440,00:22:50.000,在宫中熬得日子更长久罢了,00:22:47.140,00:22:50.380,I have just lived longer in the palace than them.
00:22:52.800,00:22:53.470,太后,00:22:53.940,00:22:55.040,Your Majesty.
00:22:55.560,00:22:57.150,隆科多大人前来请安,00:22:56.240,00:22:58.400,General Longkodo wishes to pay respects to Your Majesty.
00:22:57.480,00:22:58.590,问候太后凤体,00:22:58.460,00:23:00.020,He is concerned with Your Majesty's health.
00:23:05.120,00:23:08.470,告诉他哀家一切都好,00:23:06.040,00:23:07.320,Tell him
,,,00:23:07.860,00:23:09.160,everything's fine.
00:23:09.520,00:23:11.470,他是外臣 不宜入内,00:23:10.540,00:23:13.060,He is an external family member. He shouldn't enter the harem.
00:23:13.080,00:23:14.270,免了请安吧,,,
00:23:14.560,00:23:15.230,是,00:23:13.980,00:23:15.400,It's not a necessary trip.
,,,00:23:15.580,00:23:16.440,Yes.
00:23:19.840,00:23:22.070,太后 真的不见吗,00:23:20.640,00:23:23.160,Does Your Majesty not want to see him?
00:23:24.120,00:23:25.550,好容易这两年,,,
00:23:26.440,00:23:28.740,和皇帝的关系和缓了些,00:23:25.280,00:23:29.600,It wasn't easy to ease the tension between me and the Emperor.
00:23:30.200,00:23:31.910,如果皇帝知道他来,00:23:31.120,00:23:33.140,"If he knows that Longkodo visits me,"
00:23:32.800,00:23:34.230,只怕嘴上不说,00:23:33.840,00:23:35.520,"even if he says nothing about it,"
00:23:35.240,00:23:37.670,心里难免会有气,00:23:36.200,00:23:38.640,he will still be upset.
00:23:39.640,00:23:41.270,这么大岁数的人了,00:23:40.760,00:23:42.400,We are not young anymore.
00:23:42.160,00:23:43.550,何苦再见呢,00:23:43.120,00:23:44.740,Why should we meet again?
00:23:47.920,00:23:50.510,往年的菊花多是黄色和白色,00:23:48.980,00:23:51.580,The chrysanthemums were usually yellow and white.
00:23:51.720,00:23:55.670,今年倒多是红色 粉色和紫色,00:23:52.920,00:23:56.580,"But we have a lot of red, pink, and purple this year."
00:23:56.840,00:23:57.900,开得这样热闹,,,
00:23:58.200,00:23:59.110,跟春日里似的,00:23:57.620,00:23:59.100,Bright colors bring the garden back to life
,,,00:23:59.180,00:24:00.520,just like the spring.
00:24:01.320,00:24:03.990,宫中培植的菊花再名贵艳丽,00:24:02.200,00:24:05.240,The palace grows rare chrysanthemums cultured into vibrant colors.
00:24:04.960,00:24:06.910,到底是失了陶渊明所植菊花的,,,
00:24:07.240,00:24:08.220,清冷孤傲,00:24:05.960,00:24:09.600,"Unlike the unworldly beauty of the chrysanthemums
that Tao Yuanming planted in his solitude."
00:24:09.680,00:24:10.900,风骨虽好,00:24:10.820,00:24:12.620,Our worldly wisdom doesn't appreciate
00:24:12.440,00:24:14.190,可是世人却不懂,00:24:13.500,00:24:15.480,the qualities chrysanthemums symbolize.
00:24:15.240,00:24:16.790,装点这宫中的精致,00:24:16.180,00:24:17.840,The flowers to decorate the palace
00:24:17.200,00:24:19.710,大抵还是越鲜艳越好,00:24:18.180,00:24:20.460,are probably required to be brightly colored.
00:24:21.680,00:24:22.870,你想警醒我是吗,00:24:22.640,00:24:24.320,Is that a word of caution?
00:24:24.480,00:24:26.630,奴婢不过是随便说说,00:24:25.500,00:24:27.660,I said that thoughtlessly.
00:24:33.240,00:24:34.220,这是什么地方,00:24:34.180,00:24:35.920,What palace are we at?
00:24:37.080,00:24:39.380,这是端妃娘娘所居的延庆殿,00:24:38.100,00:24:40.820,"This is the Hall of Prolonged Celebration,
where Consort Honnête resides."
00:24:42.520,00:24:44.190,我与端妃虽有往来,00:24:43.560,00:24:45.420,Consort Honnête has visited me before
00:24:45.280,00:24:47.350,却未曾踏足她的宫室拜访,00:24:46.300,00:24:48.380,but I've never returned the visit.
00:24:48.480,00:24:49.910,却不想这样的偏僻,00:24:49.520,00:24:51.260,I didn't expect it to be so out of the way.
00:24:50.920,00:24:52.310,端妃娘娘常年患病,00:24:51.900,00:24:53.340,Her Highness is ill.
00:24:52.760,00:24:55.030,所以住在这僻静处养病,00:24:53.620,00:24:55.800,She needs a quiet palace for her recovery.
00:24:56.240,00:24:57.590,这几日时节不好,00:24:57.240,00:24:58.820,The weather hasn't been kind lately.
00:24:57.960,00:25:00.550,听说端妃娘娘病更重了,00:24:58.960,00:25:01.440,I heard Her Highness's condition has gotten worse.
00:25:02.480,00:25:03.950,我怀着身孕的时候,,,
00:25:04.160,00:25:06.190,她还真我的孩子做过两双小鞋,00:25:03.500,00:25:06.980,She made two pairs of shoes for my child when I was pregnant.
00:25:07.320,00:25:08.380,如今她病着,00:25:08.220,00:25:09.680,"Now that she's ill,"
00:25:08.840,00:25:10.510,我自然不能过门而不入的,00:25:09.860,00:25:11.600,I cannot pass her gate without entering.
00:25:11.720,00:25:12.630,你去敲门吧,00:25:12.600,00:25:13.760,Please go knock.

00:25:27.920,00:25:28.750,娘娘金安,00:25:28.780,00:25:29.960,Peace to Your Highness.
00:25:29.680,00:25:31.950,你不是端妃娘娘的贴身宫女吗,00:25:30.800,00:25:33.000,Aren't you Her Highness's personal maid?
00:25:32.760,00:25:33.950,怎么亲自来开门了,,,
00:25:34.400,00:25:35.110,你家娘娘呢,00:25:33.780,00:25:35.240,Why did you answer the door yourself?
00:25:37.280,00:25:38.390,娘娘来了就好,00:25:35.400,00:25:36.680,Where's Her Highness?
00:25:38.720,00:25:39.350,娘娘请,00:25:38.340,00:25:39.560,I'm glad Your Highness is here.
,,,00:25:39.640,00:25:40.740,Please come in.
00:26:06.560,00:26:08.550,这人呢 都去哪儿了,00:26:07.580,00:26:09.600,Why is there no one else in the palace?
00:26:09.120,00:26:10.870,自从几年前咱们娘娘病了,00:26:10.420,00:26:12.060,Her Highness fell ill a few years ago.
00:26:11.240,00:26:13.350,皇后娘娘真了让娘娘静心养病,00:26:12.200,00:26:14.400,"Her Majesty didn't assign any other
 concubines to live with Her Highness"
00:26:13.720,00:26:15.190,没有让任何小主同住,00:26:14.660,00:26:16.560,so that she could have a quiet residence.
00:26:16.840,00:26:17.950,那服侍的宫人呢,00:26:17.800,00:26:19.180,What about the other servants?
00:26:18.520,00:26:19.660,也一同迁了出去吗,00:26:19.440,00:26:20.700,Did they all move away?
00:26:20.120,00:26:21.790,娘娘打发他们出去了,00:26:21.140,00:26:22.760,Her Highness sent them away.
00:26:33.720,00:26:34.860,端妃娘娘这个样子,,,
00:26:35.240,00:26:35.950,太医怎么说,00:26:34.820,00:26:36.040,Her Highness doesn't look well.
,,,00:26:36.180,00:26:37.320,What have the doctors said?
00:26:36.760,00:26:39.320,娘娘说就吃着从前的那几味药,00:26:37.800,00:26:40.380,Her Highness said she would just keep taking her old medicine.
00:26:40.040,00:26:41.910,宫中多有事端,00:26:40.900,00:26:42.940,"With so many occurrences in the palace,"
00:26:42.240,00:26:43.510,不便再去打扰太医,00:26:43.220,00:26:44.820,she would not trouble the doctors.
00:26:45.200,00:26:46.630,端妃娘娘也太小心了,00:26:46.080,00:26:47.740,Her Highness is unduly cautious.
00:26:47.560,00:26:49.030,求医问药本是应该的,00:26:48.580,00:26:50.260,She rightfully deserves to see a doctor.
00:26:50.480,00:26:51.510,这个样子可不成,00:26:51.420,00:26:52.700,This is not good.
00:26:53.240,00:26:53.870,吉祥,00:26:54.240,00:26:55.100,Auspice.
00:26:54.240,00:26:56.270,你去太医院找温太医来瞧瞧,00:26:55.200,00:26:57.360,Bring Dr. Wen here from the Imperial Infirmary.
00:26:56.760,00:26:58.070,是 奴婢立刻去,00:26:57.760,00:26:59.100,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:27:00.320,00:27:01.070,槿汐,,,
00:27:02.120,00:27:03.230,端妃娘娘这个样子,00:27:01.340,00:27:02.340,Jinxi.
00:27:04.520,00:27:05.790,身边没有人可不行,00:27:03.120,00:27:05.000,It's necessary for Her Highness
00:27:06.560,00:27:08.510,你去咱们宫里挑个稳妥的人,00:27:05.460,00:27:07.420,to have more servants to take care of her.
00:27:08.800,00:27:09.470,来这里伺候,00:27:07.520,00:27:10.320,Send a reliable maid from our palace to work here.
00:27:09.640,00:27:10.310,好,00:27:10.460,00:27:11.520,Certainly.
00:27:33.800,00:27:34.670,娘娘躺着,,,
00:27:34.920,00:27:35.870,你怎么来了,00:27:34.680,00:27:35.640,"Lie down, Your Highness."
00:27:40.040,00:27:41.350,我偶然经过延庆殿,00:27:35.760,00:27:37.060,What brings you here?
00:27:42.280,00:27:43.500,听闻娘娘不大好,00:27:40.920,00:27:42.560,I was passing by Your Highness's palace.
00:27:43.880,00:27:44.940,就过来看看娘娘,00:27:43.400,00:27:45.800,I heard that Your Highness is unwell so I came to visit.
00:27:46.160,00:27:47.190,老毛病了,00:27:47.260,00:27:48.300,It's nothing new.
00:27:48.320,00:27:50.270,每到季节更替的时候啊,,,
00:27:50.800,00:27:51.860,就会发作,00:27:49.340,00:27:52.360,I have seizures when the season changes.
00:27:54.800,00:27:55.830,不碍事的,00:27:55.900,00:27:57.280,It doesn't matter.
00:27:57.400,00:27:58.950,身体是娘娘自己的,00:27:58.320,00:28:00.020,Your Highness's health matters.
00:27:59.560,00:28:00.870,要好生保养才是,00:28:00.460,00:28:02.280,Your Highness must take good care of it.
00:28:03.200,00:28:04.420,许久不见了,00:28:04.260,00:28:05.800,I haven't seen you for a while.
00:28:05.560,00:28:07.510,你怎么也消瘦成这样了,00:28:06.560,00:28:08.520,You've slimmed down so much.
00:28:09.920,00:28:11.230,身体还好吗,00:28:10.940,00:28:12.420,How are you recovering?
00:28:19.480,00:28:21.390,娘娘身边服侍的宫人虽少,00:28:20.460,00:28:22.800,Your Highness doesn't have many servants in your palace
00:28:22.480,00:28:23.750,但娘娘耳聪目明,00:28:23.520,00:28:25.140,but Your Highness has perceptive eyes and ears.
00:28:25.040,00:28:27.630,不出门尽知宫中事,00:28:26.060,00:28:28.600,"You perceive the palace affairs
without stepping out of your palace."
00:28:28.400,00:28:31.390,我呀 知道的事都是些表面的事,00:28:29.320,00:28:31.980,What I know is just superficial.
00:28:33.480,00:28:36.550,孩子是娘的命根子,00:28:34.600,00:28:37.240,A child is the lifeblood of the mother.
00:28:37.480,00:28:38.990,即使未出娘胎,00:28:38.500,00:28:40.280,Even an unborn child
00:28:40.640,00:28:43.350,那也是当心肝宝贝地疼着,00:28:41.600,00:28:43.920,"is cherished like ""heart and liver""."
00:28:44.520,00:28:46.310,你这样骤然失子,00:28:45.500,00:28:47.300,Your sudden loss
00:28:47.440,00:28:49.670,只怕是要伤心死了,00:28:48.580,00:28:50.180,must be devastating.
00:28:50.960,00:28:52.390,娘娘说是骤然失子,00:28:51.920,00:28:53.520,It was a sudden loss.
00:28:53.640,00:28:55.110,但我年前吃坏过药,00:28:54.700,00:28:56.580,But I had taken strong medicine before that.
00:28:56.000,00:28:58.230,怕是长久伤了身子也未可知,00:28:56.980,00:28:58.940,It might have hurt my health.
00:29:01.400,00:29:02.710,那也未必呀,00:29:02.320,00:29:04.240,We don't know that for certain.
00:29:05.560,00:29:07.790,只怕是你更伤心,,,
00:29:08.400,00:29:10.910,皇上对年世兰的处置吧,00:29:06.480,00:29:11.740,"I'm afraid what was more hurtful to you is
His Majesty's punishment for Nian Shilan."
00:29:17.640,00:29:21.470,她呀 是想效仿当年纯元皇后,00:29:18.600,00:29:24.440,"She wanted to imitate how Empress Première
punished a Lord Consort."
00:29:21.880,00:29:23.550,处置侧福晋的事,,,
00:29:25.360,00:29:30.190,我还以真皇上会因真你处死她,00:29:26.340,00:29:28.340,I thought His Majesty
,,,00:29:28.560,00:29:31.400,would execute her for you.
00:29:31.880,00:29:34.630,不过 依我看来,00:29:32.860,00:29:35.620,"But from my perspective,"
00:29:35.960,00:29:37.950,年世兰不会那么蠢,00:29:36.900,00:29:38.900,Nian Shilan is so stupid
00:29:38.800,00:29:42.230,要在她执掌后宫的时候让你出事,00:29:39.720,00:29:43.440,to let this happen when she was managing the harem.
00:29:45.560,00:29:46.870,以她的性子,00:29:46.460,00:29:48.180,My supposition is that
00:29:47.640,00:29:50.390,也就是想压压你立威而已,00:29:48.540,00:29:51.140,she was trying to re-establish her authority.
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.870,她要是知道你小产,00:29:54.980,00:29:57.140,"If she knew you would have a miscarriage,"
00:29:56.520,00:29:58.270,恐怕比谁都害怕,00:29:57.480,00:29:59.700,she would be the first one to feel afraid.
00:30:00.160,00:30:03.670,这倒是弄巧成拙了,00:30:01.120,00:30:04.640,Her cleverness became her grief.
00:30:07.800,00:30:08.940,弄巧成拙也好,,,
00:30:09.560,00:30:10.620,有意真之也罢,00:30:08.702,00:30:11.522,Whether it was accidental or intentional.
00:30:11.840,00:30:12.900,我只恨眼下,00:30:12.780,00:30:14.280,My only regret
00:30:14.280,00:30:16.070,丧子之仇是报不了了,00:30:15.240,00:30:17.160,is that I can't avenge my child.
00:30:18.560,00:30:20.430,我都病成这个样子了,00:30:19.440,00:30:21.460,I've endured all these years with my illness.
00:30:20.720,00:30:23.630,我都不急 你急什么呀,00:30:21.520,00:30:24.440,I'm in no hurry. Why are you?
00:30:24.840,00:30:27.710,自作孽不可活,00:30:25.820,00:30:29.380,"“One might escape acts of Heaven, but
not punishment from the injustices one commits.”"
00:30:28.960,00:30:31.830,咱们呀 就这么等着,00:30:29.860,00:30:32.740,We will wait.
00:30:49.800,00:30:51.350,微臣给莞嫔娘娘请安,00:30:50.700,00:30:52.600,I bow in respect before Your Highness.
00:30:53.040,00:30:55.270,吉祥 你去里头看看,,,
00:30:55.640,00:30:57.270,你们家娘娘的药熬好了没有,00:30:54.020,00:30:58.220,"Auspice, go see if the tonic is ready for Consort Honnête."
00:30:57.600,00:30:58.790,本宫有话要问温大人,00:30:58.220,00:30:59.720,I have some questions for Dr. Wen.
00:30:58.960,00:30:59.590,是,00:30:59.800,00:31:00.860,Yes.
00:31:07.080,00:31:08.910,那端妃的病交到你手上,,,
00:31:10.040,00:31:10.830,能否痊愈,00:31:08.020,00:31:12.140,"If you start taking care of Consort Honnête,
will she be able to fully recover?"
00:31:12.480,00:31:13.870,即便是华佗在世,00:31:13.420,00:31:15.380,"Even if it was the legendary doctor Hua Tuo,"
00:31:14.680,00:31:17.510,端妃娘娘也不会再生儿育女了,00:31:15.620,00:31:18.580,Consort Honnête would not be able to have children.
00:31:18.400,00:31:19.460,微臣只是尽力,,,
00:31:20.000,00:31:22.030,让她以后的日子好好地活下去,00:31:19.345,00:31:22.975,I will do my utmost to ensure Her Highness will regain her health.
00:31:24.480,00:31:26.230,难怪她那么喜欢孩子,00:31:25.640,00:31:27.720,No wonder she adores the children in the palace.
00:31:28.160,00:31:29.790,既然前事已经铸就,00:31:29.100,00:31:31.080,"If that’s cast in stone,"
00:31:30.680,00:31:33.590,那本宫只希望你能让她康健,00:31:31.620,00:31:34.540,I can only hope you will restore her health
00:31:34.080,00:31:35.670,别受太多病痛的折磨,00:31:35.020,00:31:37.060,so she will stop suffering in illness and pain.
00:31:36.880,00:31:38.020,微臣一定尽力,00:31:37.820,00:31:39.680,I will do everything I can.
00:31:42.240,00:31:43.990,有件事本宫想问问你,00:31:43.180,00:31:45.240,There's one thing I wish to ask you.
00:31:45.200,00:31:46.150,娘娘但说无妨,,,
00:31:47.800,00:31:48.940,本宫当日小产,00:31:46.140,00:31:47.880,Your Highness need not withhold it.
00:31:49.960,00:31:51.590,一直以为是欢宜香之故,00:31:48.740,00:31:52.380,I have thought my miscarriage was due to the Pleasancy
00:31:52.360,00:31:54.270,所以才跪了半个时辰便小产,00:31:53.260,00:31:55.440,which caused it to happen after kneeling for just an hour.
00:31:55.320,00:31:56.540,此物重用麝香,00:31:56.260,00:31:58.080,That incense is heavy with musk
00:31:57.520,00:31:59.430,必然对本宫身子大有损伤,00:31:58.460,00:32:00.800,so it could have greatly damaged my health.
00:32:01.240,00:32:02.190,可这之前,,,
00:32:03.480,00:32:04.990,本宫每日在年世兰宫中,00:32:02.180,00:32:03.740,"But prior to this,"
00:32:05.320,00:32:06.300,不过三四个时辰,00:32:04.420,00:32:07.420,I never stayed at her palace for over eight hours each day.
00:32:07.160,00:32:09.540,这药力之大竟至于如此吗,00:32:08.100,00:32:10.660,Does it really have such overpowering effects?
00:32:11.360,00:32:12.580,如今细细想来,,,
00:32:13.440,00:32:15.110,本宫在去她宫中前几日,00:32:12.260,00:32:14.080,"The more I think about it,"
00:32:15.480,00:32:17.190,便已有轻微的不适症状,00:32:14.380,00:32:18.200,"I had already started to feel slightly unwell
a few days before going to her palace."
00:32:17.960,00:32:19.070,这又从何说起呢,00:32:18.900,00:32:20.420,How would you explain that?
00:32:20.760,00:32:22.550,但本宫的饮食皆用银器,00:32:21.700,00:32:23.840,My food was always tested for poison
00:32:23.240,00:32:25.510,自然不可能在饮食上出任何差错,00:32:24.300,00:32:26.880,so there wasn't something amiss in my diet.
00:32:26.960,00:32:29.670,那这种不适又从何而来呢,00:32:27.900,00:32:30.820,What could have been causing my discomfort?
00:32:31.680,00:32:33.110,娘娘揣测良多,00:32:32.620,00:32:34.560,Your Highness has been thinking a lot about it.
00:32:34.160,00:32:35.510,可是因真想到了什么,00:32:35.100,00:32:36.920,Do you already have a suspicion?
00:32:40.560,00:32:41.830,当年本宫避宠,,,
00:32:43.400,00:32:44.830,你给本宫服食的药物,00:32:41.500,00:32:43.760,The herbs you prescribed
00:32:45.840,00:32:47.110,可会对身子有损,00:32:44.400,00:32:46.560,to help me avoid serving His Majesty -
00:32:48.040,00:32:49.310,会不会使身子虚弱,00:32:46.780,00:32:48.660,would they be harmful to me?
00:32:50.560,00:32:51.510,容易滑胎,00:32:48.980,00:32:52.540,Could they have made me susceptible to miscarriages?
00:32:52.520,00:32:54.430,当年微臣给小主用药,00:32:53.460,00:32:55.380,"When I prescribed the herbs for you,"
00:32:54.680,00:32:56.190,在药量上还是斟酌谨慎,00:32:55.420,00:32:57.400,I controlled the dosage very carefully.
00:32:56.720,00:32:58.990,而且小主食用之后也无不适,00:32:57.660,00:33:00.260,And you did not experience any discomfort after.
00:32:59.960,00:33:01.790,所以至于滑胎一说,,,
00:33:02.240,00:33:03.190,应该是不会的,00:33:00.900,00:33:04.100,So it's not likely that the herbs could cause miscarriage.
00:33:05.280,00:33:06.150,不过,00:33:06.220,00:33:07.500,However ...
00:33:07.520,00:33:10.030,因为个人的体质不同也很难说,00:33:08.460,00:33:10.980,It depends on one's constitution.
00:33:10.600,00:33:11.630,而且小主当年,,,
00:33:11.920,00:33:13.630,曾经受到余氏的毒害,00:33:11.545,00:33:14.575,Your Highness was poisoned by Yu.
00:33:14.040,00:33:16.830,身体余毒未清也未尽可知啊,00:33:14.980,00:33:17.780,It's possible that the poison had lasting effects.
00:33:17.600,00:33:21.350,或许 也有本宫的不是,00:33:18.660,00:33:19.780,Maybe ...
00:33:22.040,00:33:22.710,是吗,00:33:21.160,00:33:22.660,It was partially my fault.
00:33:24.000,00:33:24.630,小主,00:33:22.980,00:33:24.000,Wasn't it?
00:33:24.920,00:33:26.350,事情已经过去了这么久了,00:33:24.900,00:33:26.940,"My Lady, it is past."
00:33:27.000,00:33:28.830,年氏也好 欢宜香也罢,00:33:27.940,00:33:30.020,"Whether it was because of Nian or Pleasancy,"
00:33:29.280,00:33:31.150,您只记得是她们的错就是了,00:33:30.220,00:33:32.280,you should only remember that it was their fault.
00:33:31.600,00:33:33.950,千万不可再因真此事而自责了呀,00:33:32.540,00:33:35.060,You must stop putting any blame on yourself.
00:33:53.080,00:33:55.030,小主 你怎么到这儿来了,00:33:54.020,00:33:56.140,"My Lady, why did you leave by yourself?"
00:33:55.320,00:33:56.510,叫奴婢好找啊,00:33:56.260,00:33:57.760,I've been looking for you.
00:33:57.160,00:33:59.830,都怪奴脾 来回耽搁了时间,00:33:58.100,00:34:00.780,It's my fault for not getting back sooner.
00:34:00.320,00:34:01.300,让小主久等了,00:34:01.260,00:34:02.660,Sorry about the wait.
00:34:07.080,00:34:07.910,这是怎么了,,,
00:34:08.600,00:34:09.550,风眯了眼睛,00:34:07.980,00:34:09.280,Were you crying?
,,,00:34:09.540,00:34:10.960,It's just the dust.
00:34:11.560,00:34:13.150,怕是冷风扑了热身子,00:34:12.500,00:34:14.240,It is a bit windy today.
00:34:13.640,00:34:15.350,奴婢服侍小主回去歇息吧,00:34:14.580,00:34:16.560,Let's go back so you can have a rest.
00:34:35.360,00:34:37.310,皇上好久没有去甄姐姐那儿了,00:34:36.400,00:34:38.900,Your Majesty hasn't visited Sourire for some time.
00:34:38.280,00:34:39.790,今晚可要去姐姐那里吗,00:34:39.220,00:34:41.040,Will Your Majesty visit her tonight?
00:34:43.360,00:34:45.430,并非是朕不想去她那里,00:34:44.300,00:34:46.520,It's not that I don't want to visit her.
00:34:47.120,00:34:48.790,她没了孩子朕也伤心,00:34:48.060,00:34:50.080,I'm also sad about the loss of a child.
00:34:51.040,00:34:54.190,只是莞嫔的性子实在是太过倔强,00:34:51.980,00:34:55.140,But she has such a strong personality.
00:34:56.720,00:35:00.310,她要是有你一半的和顺便好了,00:34:57.520,00:35:00.760,I wish she was half as mild-mannered as you are.
00:35:01.680,00:35:03.670,姐姐若有什么让皇上不满的地方,00:35:02.540,00:35:05.240,Please forgive her if she ever upset Your Majesty
00:35:04.320,00:35:06.310,还请皇上念着姐姐丧子之痛,00:35:05.240,00:35:06.980,considering her painful loss.
00:35:07.040,00:35:08.470,其实姐姐也很辛苦,00:35:07.900,00:35:09.520,This isn't easy on her.
00:35:09.040,00:35:10.870,她辛苦 朕也辛苦,00:35:09.980,00:35:11.700,Nor is it on me.
00:35:12.120,00:35:13.630,她怎么不真朕想想,00:35:13.060,00:35:15.120,Why doesn't she think from my perspective?
00:35:15.040,00:35:17.070,你同莞嫔情同姐妹,00:35:15.980,00:35:18.460,You two are like sisters to each other.
00:35:18.760,00:35:20.150,她的性子你最了解,00:35:19.700,00:35:21.640,You understand her better than anyone else.
00:35:21.040,00:35:23.230,姐姐家世好 才学也好,00:35:21.980,00:35:24.380,Sourire comes from a distinguished family and is very well-learned.
00:35:24.120,00:35:25.590,臣妾很是仰慕姐姐的,00:35:25.060,00:35:26.900,I have always admired her.
00:35:26.440,00:35:28.070,也希望皇上能像过去一样,,,
00:35:28.360,00:35:29.070,喜欢姐姐,00:35:27.380,00:35:29.880,I hope Your Majesty will favor her just as before.
00:35:29.760,00:35:31.790,姐姐现在是一时没有想明白,,,
00:35:32.320,00:35:33.350,所以一直伤心,00:35:30.700,00:35:34.640,"Sourire hasn't been thinking sensibly, and that is why"
00:35:33.960,00:35:35.470,也不能好好服侍皇上,00:35:34.900,00:35:37.060,she's unable to serve Your Majesty.
00:35:36.800,00:35:39.910,不如皇上眼下先别去看姐姐,00:35:37.740,00:35:40.860,It might be for the best if Your Majesty does not visit her for now
00:35:40.400,00:35:42.110,以免言语上又有些冲撞,,,
00:35:42.440,00:35:43.350,反而不好,00:35:41.340,00:35:43.940,to avoid any undesired confrontations.
00:35:44.280,00:35:46.840,还是等臣妾去劝过姐姐以后,00:35:45.380,00:35:48.400,I will keep encouraging Sourire to think reasonably
00:35:47.120,00:35:47.950,再见面,,,
00:35:48.240,00:35:49.380,岂不皆大欢喜吗,00:35:49.060,00:35:50.660,so both of you can be happy.
00:35:50.600,00:35:52.310,这只是臣妾的一点愚见,00:35:51.520,00:35:53.440,That is just my humble opinion.
00:35:53.120,00:35:55.750,还望皇上不要厌恶臣妾多嘴才好,00:35:54.180,00:35:56.340,I hope Your Majesty does not mind it.
00:35:56.680,00:35:58.980,你这样体贴朕与莞嫔的心思,00:35:57.760,00:36:00.160,You are very considerate towards Concubine Sourire and me.
00:36:00.000,00:36:02.030,朕怎么会觉得哪里不好呢,00:36:00.960,00:36:03.000,There's nothing to disapprove of.
00:36:02.720,00:36:03.700,皇上过奖了,,,
00:36:04.520,00:36:05.580,臣妾只喜欢皇上,00:36:03.700,00:36:04.780,I'm flattered.
00:36:05.960,00:36:07.020,一直能高高兴兴的,00:36:05.580,00:36:07.920,I simply like Your Majesty to always be happy.
00:36:08.480,00:36:09.990,其实臣妾无德无能,00:36:09.560,00:36:11.260,I have no skills like Sourire's
00:36:10.800,00:36:11.750,也不及姐姐,,,
00:36:12.160,00:36:13.950,能时时真皇上分忧解难,00:36:11.840,00:36:14.720,to offer advice to Your Majesty.
00:36:14.600,00:36:16.430,何须这样妄自菲薄,00:36:15.340,00:36:17.360,You should not look down upon yourself.
00:36:17.240,00:36:19.540,你与莞嫔正如春花秋月,00:36:18.140,00:36:20.440,"You and Sourire are like
""the spring flower and the autumn moon""."
00:36:20.000,00:36:20.870,各有千秋,00:36:20.820,00:36:21.920,You both have your own merits.
00:36:21.160,00:36:24.830,那皇上是喜欢姐姐多一些呢,00:36:22.020,00:36:22.800,So ...
,,,00:36:23.620,00:36:25.880,Does Your Majesty like Sourire
00:36:25.360,00:36:26.830,还是喜欢臣妾多一些,00:36:26.280,00:36:27.580,more than me?
00:36:28.120,00:36:29.180,此时此刻,00:36:29.200,00:36:30.260,"At this moment,"
00:36:29.520,00:36:31.270,自然是容儿你多一些,00:36:30.260,00:36:31.900,I like you more.
00:36:34.760,00:36:36.310,皇上操劳国事辛苦了,00:36:34.900,00:36:36.920,Your Majesty has been working hard.
00:36:36.840,00:36:38.390,臣妾亲自摘了批把叶,,,
00:36:38.680,00:36:39.870,让人拿冰糖炖了,00:36:37.800,00:36:39.360,I picked some loquat leaves.
00:36:40.320,00:36:42.700,等下皇上喝了便能镇咳止痰,00:36:39.620,00:36:43.560,"I will have them simmered with rock sugar
to help relieve Your Majesty's cough."
00:36:43.040,00:36:44.150,而且味道也不苦,00:36:43.920,00:36:45.160,It will also taste better.
00:36:44.520,00:36:47.670,难为你还要亲手做这些事,00:36:45.420,00:36:48.140,Thank you for doing it personally.
00:36:54.600,00:36:56.390,小主 该喝药了,00:36:55.620,00:36:57.600,"My Lady, it's time for your medicine."
00:37:16.560,00:37:17.620,小主还是没喝啊,00:37:17.760,00:37:19.100,My Lady still didn't take it?
00:37:19.520,00:37:21.110,也不知小主那日见到了什么,00:37:19.980,00:37:21.660,I wonder what she saw that day.
00:37:21.480,00:37:22.670,回来就成了这个样子,,,
00:37:23.480,00:37:24.540,人病得那么厉害,00:37:22.420,00:37:23.920,She has been like this ever since.
00:37:24.880,00:37:25.790,都大半个月了,00:37:24.360,00:37:25.380,She is so severely ill.
00:37:26.240,00:37:27.070,皇上不来看,00:37:25.960,00:37:28.000,But His Majesty hasn't visited for over a half-month.
00:37:27.800,00:37:28.910,小主也不喝药,00:37:28.840,00:37:30.240,She refuses to take medicine.
00:37:29.800,00:37:31.470,我都跟苏公公说了好几回了,00:37:30.820,00:37:32.400,I've reported to Mr. Su quite a few times.
00:37:31.960,00:37:33.590,连皇后娘娘都知道小主病了,00:37:32.780,00:37:34.440,And the Empress has been informed too.
00:37:34.800,00:37:35.990,可就是不见皇上来,00:37:35.800,00:37:37.360,But His Majesty hasn't come.
00:37:38.880,00:37:40.190,看来皇上是不会来了,00:37:39.900,00:37:41.420,Looks like His Majesty won't.
00:37:45.320,00:37:47.030,从前翊坤宫和碎玉轩,00:37:46.420,00:37:48.580,The Palace of Earthly Honor and the Palace of Pearl Jade
00:37:47.720,00:37:49.510,是宫中两处最热闹的所在,00:37:48.780,00:37:50.560,used to be the most lively palaces.
00:37:50.840,00:37:52.190,如今都冷清了下来,00:37:51.900,00:37:53.580,Now they are both cold and quiet.
00:37:54.080,00:37:55.590,倒真成了一损俱损了,00:37:55.160,00:37:56.340,"""One fails, all fail."""
00:37:56.040,00:37:56.750,小主她,00:37:57.040,00:37:58.200,But My Lady is ...
00:38:03.000,00:38:04.430,你们两个怎么在外面坐着呢,,,
00:38:04.800,00:38:05.510,也不怕冷,00:38:04.000,00:38:05.460,Why are you two sitting outside?
00:38:06.160,00:38:06.870,你怎么来了,00:38:05.640,00:38:06.640,It's cold out here.
00:38:07.240,00:38:08.990,安贵人听说莞嫔小主病了,00:38:07.060,00:38:08.200,What brings you here?
00:38:09.240,00:38:10.990,特意跟御膳房要了一些桃花姬,00:38:08.220,00:38:09.640,Lady An heard that My Lady is ill.
00:38:11.240,00:38:11.950,叫我送来,00:38:10.240,00:38:12.720,"So she asked me to send some ejiao cakes
from the Imperial Kitchen."
00:38:16.680,00:38:17.900,替我谢谢你们安小主,00:38:17.700,00:38:19.100,Please thank Lady An for me.
00:38:18.360,00:38:20.150,贵人那里差事多 走不开人呢,00:38:19.320,00:38:20.960,Lady An has a lot of tasks and errands.
00:38:20.400,00:38:21.110,那我先回去了,00:38:20.960,00:38:22.180,I should return now.
00:38:24.840,00:38:26.830,小主病的时候连个人影都不见,00:38:25.780,00:38:27.700,She never visited the entire time.
00:38:27.160,00:38:27.710,还一天到晚,,,
00:38:28.080,00:38:29.140,跟小主姐姐长妹妹短的,00:38:28.080,00:38:29.860,But she still calls My Lady her sister.
00:38:29.480,00:38:31.470,罢了吧 菊青她懂什么,00:38:30.380,00:38:31.460,Leave it.
00:38:31.920,00:38:32.870,何苦和她置气,00:38:31.500,00:38:34.160,What does Daisy know? Don't be angry at her.
00:38:35.160,00:38:36.470,这些东西我看了也生气,,,
00:38:36.800,00:38:37.550,去给小允子吃,00:38:36.160,00:38:37.380,This upsets me too.
00:38:37.960,00:38:38.550,也好,00:38:37.520,00:38:38.620,I'll give it to Xiao-Yunzi.
00:38:39.440,00:38:40.470,小主现在病着,00:38:38.880,00:38:39.780,Sure.
00:38:40.880,00:38:41.510,除了温太医,00:38:40.360,00:38:41.620,My Lady is ill.
00:38:41.840,00:38:43.670,谁还会来碎玉轩给小主看病,00:38:41.760,00:38:44.400,No one will visit her except Dr. Wen.
00:38:47.600,00:38:48.910,这些药也实在难得,00:38:48.580,00:38:50.000,It took some effort to get the herbs.
00:38:49.760,00:38:50.900,我再去给小主热一热,00:38:50.860,00:38:52.320,I will reheat the medicine for My Lady.
00:38:54.160,00:38:56.190,我明天偷偷去养心殿请皇上,00:38:55.200,00:38:57.360,I will request an audience with His Majesty tomorrow.
00:38:56.840,00:38:57.710,只要皇上来了,,,
00:38:58.360,00:38:59.750,看谁还敢给咱们脸色看,00:38:57.880,00:38:59.100,"If I bring His Majesty here,"
,,,00:38:59.340,00:39:00.960,we don't need anyone's pity gifts.
00:39:10.480,00:39:11.190,皇上,,,
00:39:11.960,00:39:12.630,什么事,00:39:11.440,00:39:12.440,Your Majesty.
,,,00:39:12.840,00:39:13.620,Yes?
00:39:13.880,00:39:15.550,碎玉轩来人求见,00:39:14.960,00:39:16.840,The Palace of Pearl Jade sent someone here.
00:39:16.160,00:39:17.470,说莞嫔娘娘病着,00:39:17.120,00:39:18.540,Concubine Sourire is ill.
00:39:18.160,00:39:20.620,请皇上若是得空过去瞧瞧,00:39:19.200,00:39:21.480,They hope Your Majesty will visit her when you're available.
00:39:21.000,00:39:21.750,朕知道了,00:39:21.980,00:39:23.040,I see.
00:39:22.720,00:39:25.150,你回话 朕得空便去,00:39:23.720,00:39:26.160,Tell them I will go when I am available.
00:39:25.520,00:39:26.110,是,00:39:26.480,00:39:27.220,Yes.
00:39:26.520,00:39:29.630,其实皇上早知道莞嫔娘娘病着,00:39:27.520,00:39:30.380,Your Majesty was already aware of Her Highness's illness.
00:39:30.000,00:39:32.350,自然 奴才知道皇上忙,00:39:30.940,00:39:33.820,"But certainly, I know Your Majesty has been busy."
00:39:34.480,00:39:36.110,月关是忙 苏培盛,00:39:35.540,00:39:37.220,"I have, Su Peisheng."
00:39:38.360,00:39:41.630,可朕也不想去见莞嫔,00:39:39.440,00:39:40.840,But I
00:39:43.640,00:39:44.510,奴才愚钝,00:39:41.180,00:39:42.880,also don't want to see her.
00:39:45.240,00:39:46.630,朕问过温太医,00:39:44.560,00:39:46.100,If Your Majesty will enlighten me.
,,,00:39:46.220,00:39:47.820,I've asked Dr. Wen.
00:39:47.880,00:39:50.230,莞嫔的病起于伤心郁结,00:39:48.880,00:39:51.240,Concubine Sourire's illness is caused by her sadness.
00:39:51.280,00:39:53.660,说到底是真了失去孩子的缘故,00:39:52.300,00:39:54.720,It's because of the loss of her child after all.
00:39:54.680,00:39:56.550,与其见面彼此伤怀,00:39:55.800,00:39:57.680,"I'd rather not see her, because"
00:39:57.480,00:39:58.540,不如不去看她,00:39:58.500,00:40:00.120,then we make each other sad.
00:40:00.560,00:40:03.950,等她的心结开了 自然会好,00:40:01.620,00:40:04.700,She will be fine when she overcomes her sorrow.
00:40:04.840,00:40:06.910,那奴才就去告诉浣碧姑娘,,,
00:40:07.520,00:40:08.740,皇上得空再去吧,00:40:05.740,00:40:09.620,"I will tell her servant Jade that
Your Majesty will go when you're available."
00:40:19.880,00:40:20.910,安贵人吉祥,00:40:20.780,00:40:22.060,Peace to Lady An.
00:40:21.800,00:40:22.430,起来,00:40:22.640,00:40:23.580,Rise.
00:40:23.400,00:40:25.390,怎么见你是从养心殿的方向来,00:40:24.280,00:40:26.680,You seem to be coming from the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:40:26.320,00:40:27.350,是去见皇上了吗,,,
00:40:27.600,00:40:28.470,我家小主病了,00:40:27.340,00:40:28.380,Were you summoned by His Majesty?
00:40:29.040,00:40:30.430,我是去向皇上回享呢,00:40:28.540,00:40:29.680,My Lady has been ill.
00:40:31.360,00:40:32.990,那皇上去看姐姐了吗,00:40:30.060,00:40:31.620,His Majesty asked me to report to him.
00:40:34.480,00:40:35.150,还没有,00:40:32.320,00:40:34.120,So did His Majesty visit Sourire?
00:40:35.600,00:40:37.230,因真皇上和贵人一样忙,00:40:35.480,00:40:36.440,Not yet.
00:40:38.040,00:40:39.260,不得空去看姐姐,00:40:36.680,00:40:39.880,"His Majesty has been as busy as you, My Lady."
00:40:40.560,00:40:42.150,姐姐是怪我没有去看她吗,00:40:41.520,00:40:43.280,Does Sourire blame me for not visiting her?
00:40:43.040,00:40:44.180,我要侍奉皇上,,,
00:40:44.880,00:40:45.710,怕去了之后,00:40:44.000,00:40:45.360,I need to serve His Majesty.
00:40:46.080,00:40:47.430,姐姐知道了又要伤心,00:40:45.980,00:40:48.440,I'm afraid Sourire might feel upset when she sees me.
00:40:48.560,00:40:49.670,所以不敢去了,00:40:49.580,00:40:50.860,So I didn't want to visit her.
00:40:50.640,00:40:51.310,浣碧,,,
00:40:51.880,00:40:53.390,姐姐的病好些了吗,00:40:51.700,00:40:54.140,"Jade, has Sourire been feeling better?"
00:40:54.440,00:40:55.500,托贵人的福,,,
00:40:56.120,00:40:57.310,一定会好起来的,00:40:55.440,00:40:56.960,"Thanks for asking, My Lady."
00:40:57.800,00:40:58.780,那我就安心了,00:40:57.140,00:40:58.480,She will be better soon.
00:40:59.920,00:41:00.830,浣碧斗胆,00:40:58.800,00:41:00.040,I'm glad to hear that.
00:41:01.360,00:41:03.030,若是贵人再见到皇上的话,00:41:00.900,00:41:03.360,"Lady An, I venture to ask you"
00:41:03.480,00:41:04.460,能否提醒皇上,00:41:03.480,00:41:05.600,to remind His Majesty when you see him
00:41:05.120,00:41:07.150,碎玉轩还有贵人所谓的姐姐,,,
00:41:07.520,00:41:08.190,卧病在床,00:41:06.220,00:41:09.000,"that your ""sister"" is ill in the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:41:08.760,00:41:10.590,那么我想我家小主的病,00:41:09.700,00:41:11.540,"I believe if you do so,"
00:41:10.960,00:41:12.390,就会好得更加快一些,00:41:11.680,00:41:13.320,My Lady will get better sooner.
00:41:12.680,00:41:13.390,这个自然,00:41:13.540,00:41:14.640,Certainly.
00:41:14.280,00:41:16.310,我见到皇上总会提起,00:41:15.320,00:41:17.260,I always talk about Sourire when I'm with His Majesty.
00:41:17.160,00:41:20.190,只是怕皇上忙于政事不得空呢,00:41:18.240,00:41:20.820,"It's just that His Majesty has been
very busy with state affairs."
00:41:21.040,00:41:21.830,不过你放心,00:41:22.060,00:41:23.240,But don't worry.
00:41:22.480,00:41:24.190,我一定再好好劝劝皇上,00:41:23.460,00:41:25.360,I will certainly talk to His Majesty about this.
00:41:26.240,00:41:27.380,那先谢谢贵人了,,,
00:41:27.680,00:41:28.270,走吧,00:41:27.120,00:41:28.420,"I thank you in advance, Lady An."
,,,00:41:28.580,00:41:29.580,Go.
00:41:45.800,00:41:48.150,方才浣碧对贵人出语不敬,00:41:46.920,00:41:49.400,"Jade was disrespectful to you, My Lady."
00:41:48.920,00:41:51.550,贵人还要真莞嫔向皇上求情吗,00:41:49.900,00:41:52.460,"Will you still speak for Concubine Sourire
when you meet His Majesty?"
00:41:52.320,00:41:54.070,浣碧是姐姐的贴身侍婢,00:41:53.400,00:41:55.160,Jade is Sourire's dowry maid.
00:41:54.960,00:41:57.470,浣碧不敬就是姐姐不敬,00:41:56.040,00:41:58.560,Her disrespect is the same as Sourire's.
00:41:58.680,00:41:59.550,不过,00:41:59.880,00:42:01.040,"However,"
00:42:00.240,00:42:03.030,该进言的时候我还是会进言的,00:42:01.260,00:42:03.780,I will talk about it when appropriate.
00:42:05.440,00:42:06.070,苏培盛,00:42:06.300,00:42:07.400,Su Peisheng.
00:42:08.640,00:42:09.230,皇上,00:42:09.380,00:42:10.340,Your Majesty.

00:42:12.480,00:42:14.510,皇上 安贵人来了,00:42:13.520,00:42:15.360,"Your Majesty, Lady An has arrived."
