00:02:22.600,00:02:25.630,娘娘 福子已经死了,00:02:23.740,00:02:26.560,"Your Highness, Fuzi is dead."
00:02:27.400,00:02:28.190,死了,00:02:28.500,00:02:29.625,Dead?
00:02:31.480,00:02:32.390,怎么死了,,,
00:02:33.760,00:02:34.820,什么时候的事啊,00:02:32.500,00:02:33.920,How come?
00:02:35.160,00:02:36.510,刚打井里捞出来,00:02:34.820,00:02:36.220,When did this happen?
00:02:36.880,00:02:38.070,这人都泡肿了,00:02:36.240,00:02:39.400,Her swollen corpse was just pulled out of a well.
00:02:39.320,00:02:41.390,娘娘面前 说话也不怕忌讳,00:02:40.500,00:02:42.840,"Do you not care about respecting taboos
in front of Her Highness?"
00:02:41.880,00:02:42.710,不打紧,,,
00:02:43.840,00:02:45.590,定是娘娘那天骂了她两句,00:02:42.940,00:02:44.267,It's all right.
00:02:45.840,00:02:46.950,她就哭着跑出去,00:02:44.855,00:02:48.251,"That day, Her Highness scolded Fuzi
and she ran out of the chamber, crying."
00:02:47.520,00:02:49.390,没看清楚路 跌到井里了,00:02:48.440,00:02:50.442,She must have misstepped and stumbled in the dark.
00:02:49.880,00:02:53.070,如此说来 倒是本宫的错了,00:02:51.080,00:02:54.240,So it's my fault?
00:02:53.720,00:02:54.590,哪能啊,,,
00:02:55.160,00:02:56.510,都怪福子脾气大,00:02:54.811,00:02:56.050,Of course not.
00:02:56.840,00:02:59.300,做奴才的哪能不被说两句,00:02:56.314,00:02:58.101,It was her own fault for having such a bad temper.
,,,00:02:58.101,00:03:00.600,All servants hear criticism sometimes.
00:02:59.680,00:03:01.070,你说是吧 江福海,00:03:00.740,00:03:02.440,"Don't you agree, Jiang Fujiang?"
00:03:01.720,00:03:04.830,这个奴才就不敢说了,00:03:02.660,00:03:06.000,Your Highness... I dare not voice my opinion.
00:03:05.160,00:03:06.350,有什么不敢说的,00:03:06.320,00:03:07.800,What are you afraid of?
00:03:07.280,00:03:10.190,你不信就问问翊坤宫上下,00:03:07.800,00:03:11.120,"If you're in doubt, you can ask anyone in my palace"
00:03:10.480,00:03:12.190,是不是亲眼见她跑出去的,00:03:11.120,00:03:14.718,"if they didn't see Fuzi running out
with their own two eyes."
00:03:13.720,00:03:15.110,公公的意思,00:03:14.718,00:03:16.584,Are you suggesting
00:03:15.520,00:03:18.870,难不成是有人从后面推她了,00:03:16.584,00:03:19.680,that someone pushed her from behind?
00:03:19.480,00:03:20.310,奴才不敢,,,
00:03:20.640,00:03:21.550,没什么不敢的,00:03:20.080,00:03:21.520,I wouldn't dare.
00:03:22.160,00:03:23.140,你若不信,00:03:21.520,00:03:22.789,But you did!
00:03:23.480,00:03:25.830,大可拿本宫宫里的人一一去查,00:03:23.129,00:03:26.840,"You can investigate each and every member of my palace
if you don't believe me."
00:03:26.280,00:03:28.150,娘娘言重了,00:03:27.062,00:03:29.271,"Your Highness, that wasn't my intention."
00:03:28.520,00:03:30.350,丑话说到前头,00:03:29.460,00:03:31.400,Let me be more direct:
00:03:30.680,00:03:33.830,你今儿个来定是奉了皇后的旨意,00:03:31.782,00:03:35.276,"You're here at the Empress's behest
to investigate Fuzi's death."
00:03:34.320,00:03:37.310,你问了 本宫答了 也有人证,00:03:35.418,00:03:37.306,You have asked. I have answered.
00:03:37.880,00:03:39.070,要带人就带人,00:03:37.532,00:03:38.960,And there are witnesses.
,,,00:03:38.960,00:03:40.664,You are permitted to take away my servants.
00:03:39.480,00:03:42.150,否则今后再拿此事与本宫罗嗦,00:03:40.664,00:03:43.040,"But if you trouble me again,"
00:03:43.240,00:03:45.310,本宫就对你不客气,00:03:44.320,00:03:46.580,I won't be so kind.
00:03:47.200,00:03:49.500,奴才先告退了,00:03:48.140,00:03:50.923,"Your Highness, I shall take my leave."
00:04:04.720,00:04:06.270,你们都别记差了,00:04:05.690,00:04:07.851,"All of you, remember:"
00:04:06.720,00:04:09.830,那小福子是自己跑出去,00:04:07.851,00:04:11.159,Fuzi ran out by herself.
00:04:10.360,00:04:12.430,失足掉到井里淹死的,00:04:11.385,00:04:13.600,She slipped and fell into the well.
00:04:13.600,00:04:14.350,是,00:04:14.636,00:04:15.784,"Yes, sir."
00:04:21.200,00:04:22.950,好香啊 小主你闻,00:04:22.420,00:04:24.440,"My Lady, it smells so fragrant."
00:04:27.960,00:04:29.590,小主昨日受了惊吓,,,
00:04:30.080,00:04:32.030,午膳吃不下 晚膳也没用,00:04:29.109,00:04:33.287,"My Lady, you haven't eaten
after you had a shock yesterday."
00:04:32.920,00:04:34.830,今儿早上好歹应该吃点东西吧,00:04:33.855,00:04:36.620,You should at least eat something this morning.
00:04:35.920,00:04:37.550,一时的惊吓倒也不要紧,00:04:36.922,00:04:39.301,A moment of fright doesn't matter.
00:04:38.200,00:04:41.980,只怕以后都要处在惊吓之中,00:04:39.301,00:04:43.261,"What I'm worried about is
having to live in fear every day."
00:04:42.840,00:04:43.590,为什么,00:04:43.902,00:04:45.200,Why?
00:04:45.240,00:04:46.670,夏常在出言不逊,00:04:46.500,00:04:48.752,"Attendant Xia was insolent,"
00:04:48.080,00:04:49.790,可见我与眉庄树敌不少,00:04:48.940,00:04:51.680,and that shows how many enemies Meizhuang and I have.
00:04:54.720,00:04:57.870,华妃强势 手段更是毒辣,00:04:55.808,00:04:59.360,"Consort Fleur is imperious,
and her tactics are merciless."
00:04:59.440,00:05:00.790,如此腹背受敌,00:04:59.600,00:05:01.872,"With so many daggers poised
over my back and stomach,"
00:05:01.440,00:05:02.950,不能保全自身也就罢了,00:05:01.872,00:05:04.580,"it wouldn't matter if they prevailed over me,"
00:05:03.760,00:05:04.870,只是一旦获罪,,,
00:05:06.080,00:05:07.630,恐怕更要株连满门,00:05:04.882,00:05:08.617,"but my whole family would suffer if I
received any punishment."
00:05:08.600,00:05:09.310,那怎么办,00:05:09.522,00:05:10.991,What should we do?
00:05:11.360,00:05:12.390,头疼得很,00:05:12.500,00:05:14.257,I don't know...
00:05:19.400,00:05:21.230,小主还记得咱在家时,,,
00:05:21.520,00:05:22.550,常做桂花蜜糖吗,00:05:20.604,00:05:23.760,"My Lady, do you remember how we often made
osmanthus flower honey at home?"
00:05:23.240,00:05:24.070,这花开得正好,,,
00:05:24.320,00:05:26.620,不如我去折些来给小主腌了吃,00:05:24.250,00:05:27.920,"Now that we have so many osmanthus flowers,
how about I marinate some in sugar?"
00:05:27.360,00:05:28.110,好不好,00:05:28.222,00:05:29.579,Would you like that?
00:05:30.600,00:05:31.550,你的手艺好,,,
00:05:32.360,00:05:34.150,你做了我自然就吃,00:05:31.800,00:05:35.540,"Your cooking is always delightful.
I will eat it if you make some."
00:05:34.920,00:05:35.470,好,,,
00:05:36.560,00:05:37.430,我去找几个人来,00:05:35.879,00:05:36.839,Yes.
,,,00:05:37.604,00:05:39.245,I'll get some help.
00:06:05.640,00:06:08.790,佩儿 你在瞧什么呢 这么有趣,00:06:06.736,00:06:09.900,"Violet, what are you looking at?
You look intrigued."
00:06:09.000,00:06:11.230,小主快看 这蚂蚁搬糖好奇怪呢,00:06:09.900,00:06:12.660,"My Lady, Look. The ants are moving strangely."
00:06:16.840,00:06:19.670,你瞧这蚂蚁一直绕着海棠树根走,00:06:17.924,00:06:20.956,They keep moving around the root of the crabapple tree.
00:06:20.520,00:06:21.500,像是在怕什么,,,
00:06:23.400,00:06:25.270,奴婢倒觉得这些蚂蚁真笨,00:06:21.673,00:06:23.275,They seem to be avoiding something.
00:06:25.560,00:06:26.390,舍近求远,00:06:24.040,00:06:27.835,I think the ants are stupid for taking such a long detour.
00:06:28.720,00:06:30.470,小允子 你快过来,,,
00:06:31.160,00:06:32.870,把这蚂蚁绕开的地方掘开看看,00:06:29.660,00:06:34.147,"Xiao-Yunzi, dig around here and see what's underneath."
00:06:33.080,00:06:33.710,明白,00:06:34.147,00:06:35.204,Understood.
00:06:36.520,00:06:37.910,这 这什么呀 埋得这么深,00:06:37.140,00:06:39.505,"What's this, buried so deep?"
00:06:40.560,00:06:42.150,小主 这儿有个罐子,,,
00:06:42.360,00:06:42.990,挖出来看看,00:06:41.500,00:06:43.400,"My Lady, there's a jar here."
,,,00:06:43.400,00:06:44.569,Take it out.
00:06:44.760,00:06:47.510,什么呀 使劲,00:06:46.000,00:06:47.206,What is it?
00:06:49.600,00:06:50.630,来来来我看看,00:06:48.160,00:06:49.280,Pull harder.
00:06:51.560,00:06:52.310,你躲开,00:06:50.618,00:06:51.947,"Here, let me take a look."
,,,00:06:52.540,00:06:53.721,Go away.
00:06:58.640,00:07:02.070,这罐子真古怪香得很,00:06:59.549,00:07:01.111,What a strange jar.
,,,00:07:02.521,00:07:03.868,It has a strong scent.
00:07:08.400,00:07:11.510,这碎玉轩原来是芳贵人住的,00:07:09.426,00:07:12.833,It could be something that belonged to Noble Lady Parfum.
00:07:12.200,00:07:14.070,后来小产后打入冷宫,,,
00:07:14.920,00:07:15.830,但也得过宠啊,00:07:13.549,00:07:17.088,"She was favored by the Emperor, but got banished to the
Cold Palace after her miscarriage."
00:07:16.760,00:07:19.190,这里边是不是什么稀罕的香料啊,00:07:17.842,00:07:20.592,Could it be some rare incense?
00:07:20.120,00:07:21.910,小主爱香 那不如就打开看看,,,
00:07:22.280,00:07:23.190,是什么稀奇的香料,00:07:21.255,00:07:24.466,My Lady likes incense. Let's open the jar and have a look.
00:07:23.440,00:07:24.230,快打开看看,,,
00:07:28.320,00:07:29.670,我来看看是什么,00:07:29.080,00:07:31.080,"Here, give it to me."
00:07:31.320,00:07:32.230,快打开看看,00:07:32.377,00:07:33.660,Unwrap it.
00:07:36.920,00:07:38.110,什么呀 这么冲鼻子,,,
00:07:38.880,00:07:39.670,还一股骚臭味,00:07:38.140,00:07:39.596,It's so foul!
00:07:40.880,00:07:42.270,不过是一些不值钱的散香,00:07:39.785,00:07:41.408,What a pungent smell!
00:07:43.000,00:07:43.830,浣碧 收起来,00:07:41.860,00:07:43.798,It's just some cheap incense.
00:07:45.400,00:07:46.510,今日挖出东西的事情,00:07:44.024,00:07:45.269,"Jade, put it away."
00:07:46.960,00:07:47.830,一个都不许说出去,00:07:46.540,00:07:49.039,You must not say anything about what we found today.
00:07:48.040,00:07:48.710,是,,,
00:07:49.000,00:07:49.910,免得叫人拿住了说闲话,00:07:49.039,00:07:49.895,Yes.
00:07:50.880,00:07:51.630,是,00:07:49.960,00:07:51.896,We wouldn't want people gossiping about it.
00:07:52.240,00:07:53.670,桂花糖明日再做吧,00:07:53.254,00:07:55.428,"Vermilion, let's have the osmanthus dessert tomorrow."
00:07:55.280,00:07:56.630,都散了 散了,00:07:56.440,00:07:58.294,"Everyone, disperse."
00:07:58.520,00:07:59.500,快去干活吧,00:07:59.161,00:08:00.822,Go back to your work.
00:08:00.200,00:08:01.390,洗碧陪我进去,00:08:00.822,00:08:02.774,"Jade, let's go inside."
00:08:02.920,00:08:03.830,快把它收起来,00:08:04.000,00:08:05.200,Take it away.
00:08:10.480,00:08:11.460,小主怎么了,,,
00:08:11.800,00:08:12.750,脸色怎么这么差,00:08:11.661,00:08:13.976,"What's wrong, My Lady? You look unwell."
00:08:13.920,00:08:15.110,我心里慌得厉害,00:08:14.957,00:08:16.651,I feel sick and flustered.
00:08:18.040,00:08:21.150,浣碧 你去找温太医来瞧瞧,00:08:19.149,00:08:22.392,"Jade, can you bring Dr. Wen here?"
00:08:22.440,00:08:24.740,记着 必得是温太医,00:08:23.500,00:08:26.212,"Remember, it has to be him."
00:08:44.480,00:08:48.150,温大人 幸好有您在,00:08:45.500,00:08:46.821,Dr. Wen!
00:08:50.080,00:08:51.550,我家小主身子不适,00:08:48.339,00:08:49.939,I'm glad you're on shift.
00:08:51.840,00:08:52.750,您快去瞧瞧吧,00:08:51.184,00:08:54.000,"My Lady is not feeling well.
Please go and see her right away."
00:08:53.640,00:08:54.390,小主没事吧,,,
00:08:54.760,00:08:55.590,不管有事没事,00:08:54.780,00:08:55.900,Is My Lady all right?
00:08:55.840,00:08:57.590,小主说只要大人您去瞧,00:08:55.900,00:08:58.840,She told me that you have to be the one who examines her.
00:08:57.920,00:08:58.710,大人快去吧,,,
00:08:58.920,00:08:59.590,好,00:08:59.109,00:09:00.185,Please go quickly.
,,,00:09:00.185,00:09:01.062,Yes.
00:09:13.320,00:09:16.230,小主似乎受到了很大的惊吓,00:09:14.500,00:09:17.916,"My Lady, you had quite a fright."
00:09:19.320,00:09:22.630,我看到了一些本不该看到的东西,00:09:20.500,00:09:24.103,I saw things I shouldn't have.
00:09:23.160,00:09:24.950,那就要想办法忘掉那些东西,00:09:24.291,00:09:26.534,You should try to put them out of your mind.
00:09:27.800,00:09:28.990,当日在宫外,,,
00:09:30.280,00:09:33.190,大人的承诺不知是否还当真,00:09:29.000,00:09:34.640,"Dr Wen, will you keep the promise
you made to me outside the temple?"
00:09:33.560,00:09:36.590,当真 永远事事以你为重,00:09:34.640,00:09:37.871,"Yes, I will forever put you before everything else."
00:09:40.800,00:09:44.550,永远二字 说来简单,00:09:42.118,00:09:45.706,"""Forever"" is easy to say"
00:09:46.120,00:09:49.510,若真做起来只怕是很难了,00:09:47.290,00:09:50.522,but hard to commit to.
00:09:50.720,00:09:52.470,微臣自知别无所长,,,
00:09:53.080,00:09:55.310,唯一值得一提的就是重诺而已,00:09:51.766,00:09:56.388,"I know I fall short elsewhere.
My only virtue is that I can keep a promise."
00:09:56.000,00:09:56.870,年少相识,00:09:57.000,00:09:58.246,"We met in childhood,"
00:09:57.120,00:09:59.390,甄家救父之恩 没齿难忘,00:09:58.246,00:10:01.161,"and your father's kindness to my family
will not be forgotten, even in my old and toothless days."
00:10:04.200,00:10:06.110,小主吩咐即可,00:10:05.500,00:10:07.828,"My Lady, I will do anything you ask."
00:10:17.040,00:10:18.100,我不想侍寝,00:10:18.300,00:10:20.369,I don't want to share the emperor's bed.
00:10:25.440,00:10:28.310,虽然微臣的心中也不愿小主侍寝,00:10:26.740,00:10:29.756,"Although that is also what my heart desires,"
00:10:29.600,00:10:31.070,可是小主既已入宫,,,
00:10:31.360,00:10:32.870,侍寝便是迟早的事,00:10:30.794,00:10:34.251,"since you have entered the palace, it is unavoidable."
00:10:33.520,00:10:36.510,为前程计 还是越早越好啊,00:10:34.553,00:10:37.778,"For you life ahead, I hope you can
do it sooner, My Lady."
00:10:37.600,00:10:38.910,可我实在害怕,00:10:38.840,00:10:40.562,But I'm too scared
00:10:40.160,00:10:41.380,这个时候侍寝,00:10:41.128,00:10:43.195,to serve His Majesty now.
00:10:44.160,00:10:46.590,温大人 我给你看样东西,00:10:45.206,00:10:48.061,"Dr. Wen, I'd like to show you something."
00:10:58.120,00:11:00.270,小主怎么会有这样的东西,00:10:59.300,00:11:01.990,"How did this come into your possession, My Lady?"
00:11:01.400,00:11:02.620,碎玉轩的海棠,00:11:02.660,00:11:05.102,The crabapple tree in my courtyard
00:11:03.840,00:11:06.910,今年春天便开始不开花了,00:11:05.102,00:11:08.185,did not bloom this spring.
00:11:08.080,00:11:11.590,我今日机缘巧合在树下挖出此物,00:11:09.279,00:11:13.000,I accidentally discovered a jar under the tree.
00:11:13.680,00:11:15.470,听闻从前住在这里的芳贵人,,,
00:11:15.840,00:11:16.790,无故小产,00:11:14.800,00:11:17.847,I've heard of Lady Parfum's unexpected miscarriage.
00:11:17.200,00:11:18.990,想来也是这些东西的缘故,00:11:18.186,00:11:20.296,I suppose this is the cause
00:11:21.160,00:11:23.190,可见宫中勾心斗角多厉害,00:11:22.000,00:11:24.865,and a trace of the fierce rivalries in the palace.
00:11:24.880,00:11:26.270,只怕芳贵人至今,,,
00:11:27.400,00:11:29.350,都不知道自己折损谁手,00:11:26.000,00:11:30.500,"Lady Parfum might never have scented
the cause of her despair."
00:11:29.760,00:11:31.150,幸好小主发现得早,,,
00:11:31.440,00:11:32.110,否则的话,00:11:31.000,00:11:32.476,It was a timely discovery.
00:11:32.440,00:11:33.660,这碎玉轩中的女子,,,
00:11:34.240,00:11:35.380,恐怕都会有大碍,00:11:32.476,00:11:36.735,"Otherwise, all the girls in your palace would have been affected."
00:11:36.240,00:11:38.590,微臣自知无福陪伴小主一生,00:11:37.376,00:11:40.401,"Although I cannot spend my life beside you,"
00:11:39.600,00:11:41.590,但若能够保护小主一世周全,,,
00:11:42.040,00:11:43.750,也算是成全了当日的承诺,00:11:40.778,00:11:44.958,"my promise will be fulfilled
if I can be the guardian of your welfare."
00:11:46.680,00:11:49.190,我的病要紧吗,00:11:47.820,00:11:50.561,Is my illness serious?
00:11:49.760,00:11:51.390,受惊发热 重在疗心,00:11:50.900,00:11:52.810,"The internal heat caused by the shock must be
treated emotionally."
00:11:52.040,00:11:55.270,若好好医治 不出半月也就好了,00:11:53.150,00:11:56.610,It will be cured in half a month if you take care.
00:11:58.520,00:11:59.830,不过小主的意思,,,
00:12:00.120,00:12:01.310,既然是要好好调养,,,
00:12:01.760,00:12:03.430,那微臣便会开出一个,00:11:59.500,00:12:06.176,"But if you wish, I'll prescribe a formula
for a gradual and comprehensive recovery."
00:12:03.800,00:12:04.940,好好调养的方子,,,
00:12:12.480,00:12:15.510,这麝香仁是在麝香中药性最烈者,,,
00:12:16.080,00:12:17.830,小主实在不宜放在身边,00:12:13.839,00:12:18.622,"Musk can cause miscarriage or infertility.
You shouldn't keep this near you."
00:12:18.240,00:12:19.380,还是交予微臣,,,
00:12:19.680,00:12:22.240,他日入药 也算了了一桩罪孽,00:12:19.208,00:12:23.566,"Allow me find a purpose for it at the Imperial Infirmary
to make amends for its past crimes."
00:12:24.840,00:12:28.590,温大人 我实在害怕,00:12:26.000,00:12:27.400,Dr. Wen...
,,,00:12:28.381,00:12:30.188,I can't shake off my fear.
00:12:31.720,00:12:32.390,别怕,00:12:32.840,00:12:34.080,Don't be afraid.
00:12:35.240,00:12:38.150,流朱 送温大人出去,00:12:36.420,00:12:37.260,"Vermilion,"
00:12:39.120,00:12:39.950,是,00:12:38.090,00:12:39.926,escort Dr. Wen out.
,,,00:12:40.000,00:12:41.234,Yes.
00:12:50.560,00:12:52.830,莞常在病了 昨儿还好好的,00:12:51.500,00:12:54.236,"Attendant Sourire is sick?
She was well yesterday."
00:12:53.880,00:12:56.440,莞常在现在邪风侵体,,,
00:12:56.680,00:12:58.550,又兼心悸受惊 诱发时疾,00:12:54.877,00:12:59.792,"The evil qi invaded her body and induced heart palpitations.
Attendant Sourire contracted a seasonal illness."
00:12:59.120,00:13:00.310,需隔断静养,,,
00:13:00.800,00:13:01.940,心悸受惊,00:13:00.000,00:13:01.726,She needs to rest in quarantine.
,,,00:13:01.726,00:13:03.249,Heart palpitations?
00:13:02.360,00:13:04.870,是 也就是受惊过度,00:13:03.437,00:13:05.921,Due to intense fright.
00:13:05.200,00:13:07.990,小主现在浑身发热 呓语不断,00:13:06.260,00:13:09.000,"Attendant Sourire has a high fever
and experiences difficulty talking."
00:13:08.280,00:13:08.910,既是这样,,,
00:13:09.200,00:13:11.630,那淳常在就得搬离碎玉轩避疾了,00:13:09.189,00:13:12.529,"In that case, Attendant Chun must move out."
00:13:12.840,00:13:13.630,是,,,
00:13:14.760,00:13:15.980,现在时气不好,00:13:14.012,00:13:15.071,Yes.
00:13:16.440,00:13:18.630,莞常在又是内外并发之症,00:13:15.826,00:13:20.954,"Attendant Sourire's illness has internal and external factors,
and can be infectious with the change of seasons."
00:13:19.080,00:13:22.670,微臣怕万一染及其他小主贵体,00:13:20.954,00:13:24.274,I'm afraid if other concubines catch the disease...
00:13:22.880,00:13:23.670,那,,,
00:13:24.000,00:13:25.220,那就让她搬吧,,,
00:13:26.080,00:13:28.310,既然莞常在的病是你瞧的,00:13:24.801,00:13:26.852,Attendant Chun will move out then.
00:13:28.560,00:13:30.470,这一时三刻怕也好不了,00:13:27.304,00:13:33.243,"Since you diagnosed Attendant Sourire's illness,
you should continue to tend to her."
00:13:30.760,00:13:32.110,你就继续伺候着,,,
00:13:33.600,00:13:35.470,微臣自当尽心竭力,00:13:34.790,00:13:36.954,"Your Majesty, I will spare no effort."
00:13:37.560,00:13:40.120,今日新晋的宫嫔可以侍寝了,00:13:38.500,00:13:41.861,"Starting tonight, the new concubines can
serve Your Majesty."
00:13:40.880,00:13:42.950,皇上还打算去华妃那里吗,00:13:41.880,00:13:44.404,Would Your Majesty still prefer to visit Consort Fleur?
00:13:44.200,00:13:46.070,你是在试探朕的心意吗,00:13:45.300,00:13:47.840,Are you probing my intentions?
00:13:47.360,00:13:49.230,臣妾不敢揣测圣意,00:13:48.406,00:13:50.718,I dare not speculate about Your Majesty's mind.
00:13:49.800,00:13:51.430,还是请皇上翻牌子吧,00:13:50.907,00:13:53.495,The Attendance Services will present the name tags.
00:14:02.120,00:14:03.950,请皇上翻牌子,00:14:03.120,00:14:05.456,"Your Majesty, please turn over a name tag."
00:14:10.680,00:14:12.070,莞常在的牌子呢,,,
00:14:13.200,00:14:14.070,回皇上的话,00:14:11.700,00:14:13.971,Where's the name tag for Attendant Sourire?
00:14:14.480,00:14:16.750,今天午后太医院来人禀报,00:14:14.197,00:14:18.092,"Your Majesty, the Imperial Infirmary reported this afternoon"
00:14:17.120,00:14:20.790,说莞常在心悸受惊 突发时疾,00:14:18.356,00:14:22.190,that Attendant Sourire contracted a plague due to emotional distress.
00:14:21.080,00:14:22.830,需要隔断静养,,,
00:14:23.080,00:14:24.190,心悸受惊,00:14:22.190,00:14:24.040,She is required to rest in quarantine.
00:14:25.000,00:14:26.910,华妃当着莞常在 沈贵人,00:14:24.080,00:14:25.632,Emotional distress?
00:14:27.240,00:14:28.150,和安答应的面前,,,
00:14:28.400,00:14:30.390,下令赐了夏常在一丈红,00:14:26.047,00:14:32.080,"Consort Fleur granted Attendant Xia ""Three Yards of Red""
in front of Attendant Sourire, Lady Shen, and Companion An."
00:14:31.040,00:14:34.070,夏常在她现在已经残废了,00:14:32.269,00:14:35.700,Attendant Xia has become... paralyzed.
00:14:34.600,00:14:35.430,那为了什么呢,,,
00:14:35.920,00:14:37.430,是夏常在自己无礼,00:14:35.700,00:14:37.069,What did she do this for?
00:14:37.760,00:14:39.430,在宫里想动手打人,00:14:37.069,00:14:40.540,Attendant Xia was disrespectful and intended to beat a concubine.
00:14:39.960,00:14:42.190,不过华妃下手太狠了,00:14:41.000,00:14:43.520,But Consort Fleur's punishment was too harsh.
00:14:42.680,00:14:44.910,在宫里动手是该给点教训,,,
00:14:45.200,00:14:45.910,不必理她,00:14:43.746,00:14:47.306,"Attendant Xia should learn a lesson
about attempting to use violence in the palace."
00:14:46.920,00:14:48.140,华妃身边的福子,,,
00:14:48.480,00:14:50.110,不明不白地掉在井里了,00:14:48.104,00:14:51.498,"Consort Fleur's maid, Fuzi, died in a well for unknown reasons."
00:14:50.840,00:14:53.430,莞常在无意中瞧见了,00:14:51.913,00:14:54.702,And Attendant Sourire saw her dead body.
00:14:53.760,00:14:54.900,不明不白的,,,
00:14:56.000,00:14:57.060,华妃怎么说,00:14:54.928,00:14:56.429,For unknown reasons?
00:14:57.360,00:14:58.390,说是失足,00:14:56.995,00:14:58.425,What did Consort Fleur say?
00:14:58.840,00:15:01.990,可是江福海觉得有不妥的地方,00:14:58.425,00:15:03.409,"She said Fuzi lost her footing,
but Jiang Fuhai believes there were other reasons."
00:15:04.600,00:15:08.380,宫女好歹也是出身八旗的,00:15:05.860,00:15:09.579,Maids are from the Eight Banners.
00:15:09.880,00:15:11.020,华妃,00:15:10.862,00:15:12.631,Consort Fleur...
00:15:13.800,00:15:14.750,你好好查查吧,,,
00:15:15.280,00:15:15.950,是,00:15:14.781,00:15:17.073,Keep investigating.
00:15:17.400,00:15:18.950,莞常在病了,00:15:18.395,00:15:20.400,Attendant Sourire is sick ...
00:15:19.480,00:15:22.230,沈贵人和安答应还好好的,00:15:20.500,00:15:23.680,Noble Lady Shen and Companion An were not affected.
,,,00:15:26.100,00:15:28.160,[Noble Lady Shen]

00:16:07.400,00:16:09.990,先给小主您讲讲规矩,00:16:07.077,00:16:11.152,"Please let her go over the rules with you, My Lady."
00:16:10.520,00:16:12.470,过一会儿凤鸾春恩车,,,
00:16:12.800,00:16:15.360,就要来接小主去养心殿了,00:16:11.690,00:16:16.320,"You will soon be taken to the Hall of Mental Cultivation
by the Phoenix Carriage."
00:16:16.240,00:16:20.350,小主 您就鳘好吧,00:16:17.308,00:16:21.280,"My Lady, await your blessings."

00:16:30.040,00:16:32.150,皇上 沈贵人到了,00:16:31.166,00:16:33.616,"Your Majesty, Noble Lady Shen is here."
00:16:32.920,00:16:33.590,抬进来吧,00:16:33.880,00:16:35.283,Carry her in.
00:17:08.160,00:17:09.030,皇上,00:17:09.400,00:17:10.794,Your Majesty.
00:17:15.480,00:17:16.590,小主喜欢菊花,,,
00:17:16.880,00:17:18.670,皇上就赏了这么多 真是有心,00:17:16.435,00:17:20.610,"My Lady, you like chrysanthemums,
so His Majesty gifted all these to you. How thoughtful!"
00:17:19.560,00:17:22.270,秋天除了赏菊花 还能赏什么,00:17:20.839,00:17:23.532,That's the only flower we have in autumn.
00:17:22.600,00:17:23.660,是你想多了,00:17:23.532,00:17:24.627,Don't overthink.
00:17:24.800,00:17:26.990,真的 皇上最疼小主了,00:17:25.920,00:17:28.200,But it's true. His Majesty cherishes you the most.
00:17:27.400,00:17:29.150,新人入宫都一个多月了,,,
00:17:29.400,00:17:30.950,几位答应那里皇上还没去,,,
00:17:31.200,00:17:32.990,其余的人皇上都是淡淡的,00:17:28.539,00:17:33.880,"The new concubines moved in more than a month ago.
His Majesty hasn't given anyone else much attention."
00:17:33.360,00:17:34.950,唯独对小主另眼相看,,,
00:17:35.240,00:17:37.470,召幸得最多不说赏赐也最多,00:17:34.333,00:17:37.728,"You are not only most-summoned concubine, but also receive the most rewards."
00:17:37.760,00:17:40.190,青天白日的 说这个做什么,00:17:38.860,00:17:41.660,You shouldn't be discussing this in broad daylight.
00:17:42.120,00:17:45.390,小主 这白的是阳春瑞雪,,,
00:17:45.720,00:17:47.390,黄的是金龙凌云,00:17:43.480,00:17:48.540,"The white ones are called ""Auspicious Spring Snow""
and the golden ones are ""Cloud Soaring Dragon""."
00:17:47.720,00:17:48.700,还有那朵并蒂的,,,
00:17:49.160,00:17:50.910,像极了皇上和小主,00:17:48.729,00:17:51.685,"The two snuggling on one stem
resembles you and His Majesty."
00:17:51.280,00:17:53.030,你这丫头 嘴坏极了,00:17:51.949,00:17:53.972,Enough with the teasing!
00:17:53.760,00:17:55.670,皇上驾到,00:17:54.811,00:17:56.931,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:17:57.120,00:17:58.470,皇上吉祥,,,
00:17:58.800,00:18:00.430,说什么呢 笑那么热闹,00:17:58.260,00:17:59.696,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:18:00.680,00:18:02.980,也说给朕听听 起来吧,00:17:59.960,00:18:02.758,What's so funny? Let me hear it.
00:18:03.360,00:18:04.340,谢皇上,00:18:03.475,00:18:05.775,"- Rise.
- I thank Your Majesty."
00:18:06.000,00:18:07.830,这花还喜欢吗,00:18:07.060,00:18:09.367,How do you like the flowers?
00:18:09.640,00:18:11.270,朕昨日经过花房,,,
00:18:11.520,00:18:12.910,看见花开得精神,,,
00:18:13.320,00:18:14.750,就叫人送来给你瞧,00:18:11.020,00:18:15.920,"I saw them in full bloom at the garden house,
so I had them sent to your palace."
00:18:15.160,00:18:17.390,臣妾很喜欢 多谢皇上,00:18:16.222,00:18:18.840,I adore them. I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:18.160,00:18:19.140,回皇上的话,,,
00:18:19.360,00:18:20.790,我们小主特别喜欢菊花,,,
00:18:21.120,00:18:22.260,所以特别感念皇上,00:18:19.142,00:18:23.416,"Your Majesty, My Lady is very fond of chrysanthemums.
She is deeply thankful to your Majesty."
00:18:25.160,00:18:28.390,是了 你衣裳上也绣着菊花,00:18:26.264,00:18:30.110,I can see that from the embroidery on your dress.
00:18:29.560,00:18:30.870,为什么喜欢菊花,,,
00:18:31.560,00:18:33.860,宁可枝头抱香死,00:18:30.638,00:18:32.608,Why do you like chrysanthemums?
00:18:34.160,00:18:36.110,不曾吹落北风中,00:18:33.000,00:18:37.500,"""The withered flowers still hold fragrance on the stem;
They never surrender or fall in the northern wind."""
00:18:36.560,00:18:38.790,臣妾喜欢它的气节,00:18:37.915,00:18:40.580,I like the flowers for their integrity.
00:18:39.480,00:18:40.870,你读过的书不少,00:18:40.731,00:18:42.183,You are well-read.
00:18:41.600,00:18:44.270,臣妾卖弄了 请皇上恕罪,00:18:42.673,00:18:45.480,I didn't mean to show off. I seek Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:18:48.840,00:18:52.430,朕喜欢你读书 读书能知礼,00:18:50.220,00:18:53.703,I like that you read. Books teach us decorum.
00:18:53.280,00:18:54.550,菊花有气节,,,
00:18:55.440,00:18:59.140,可是朕更喜欢菊花独立秋风,00:18:54.420,00:19:01.920,"Chrysanthemums are known for their perseverance.
But I most value their aloofness from the other spring flowers."
00:18:59.480,00:19:00.620,不与百花争艳,,,
00:19:01.200,00:19:04.670,耐得住寂寞 才能享得住长远,00:19:02.146,00:19:06.245,It endures loneliness so it can thrive in eternity.
00:19:05.440,00:19:06.870,臣妾受教了,00:19:06.660,00:19:08.203,I am thankful for Your Majesty's teaching.
00:19:08.840,00:19:09.870,你若喜欢,,,
00:19:10.480,00:19:11.230,朕就让他们,,,
00:19:11.520,00:19:13.350,再挑好的菊花来给你瞧,00:19:10.100,00:19:14.501,"If you like, I will have more chrysanthemums
selected and sent to you."
00:19:14.240,00:19:17.590,对了 听说花房里有绿菊,,,
00:19:17.960,00:19:19.910,培植了好些日子才种出来,00:19:15.406,00:19:20.867,"I know the garden house has worked hard to
cultivate some green chrysanthemums to bloom."
00:19:20.200,00:19:21.070,朕都赏你,,,
00:19:21.560,00:19:22.620,多谢皇上,00:19:21.244,00:19:22.406,You will have all of them.
,,,00:19:22.406,00:19:23.834,I thank Your Majesty.
00:19:31.880,00:19:33.020,这个堂名,,,
00:19:33.960,00:19:35.990,像个老学究书斋的名字,00:19:33.000,00:19:37.406,"The name of your chamber sounds like it belongs
to a scholar's classroom."
00:19:36.400,00:19:37.710,没半点情韵,00:19:37.632,00:19:38.911,How boring.
00:19:39.480,00:19:43.990,你既喜欢菊花 就叫存菊堂吧,00:19:40.580,00:19:45.571,"Since you like the flowers,
I will name it the Chamber of Chrysanthemums for you."
00:19:49.560,00:19:50.830,朕今日过来,,,
00:19:51.280,00:19:52.630,是有个打算想告诉你,00:19:50.500,00:19:54.103,I came today with a purpose in mind.
00:19:55.000,00:19:58.070,朕想让你学着点管家的事,00:19:56.000,00:19:59.372,I want you to learn about housekeeping for the palace.
00:19:58.840,00:20:00.590,琐碎的 麻烦的,,,
00:20:01.320,00:20:03.070,都留着心 多学学,00:19:59.900,00:20:04.520,"The trivial, the troublesome,
you should pay attention and learn them."
00:20:03.920,00:20:06.190,可是臣妾不懂这些,00:20:04.935,00:20:07.334,But I know nothing about housekeeping.
00:20:06.560,00:20:07.950,不懂才要学啊,00:20:07.523,00:20:09.280,That's why you should learn.
00:20:09.040,00:20:11.340,你聪明 识大体,00:20:10.060,00:20:12.726,You're intelligent and prudent.
00:20:11.960,00:20:13.390,朕知道 也喜欢,00:20:12.877,00:20:14.851,I know that and appreciate it.
00:20:14.640,00:20:15.950,所以嘱咐你,,,
00:20:17.120,00:20:18.510,管这宫里的事,00:20:15.832,00:20:17.671,So I am entrusting you with this task.
00:20:18.920,00:20:20.190,就像管着一个家,00:20:18.274,00:20:21.459,Managing the palace is like running a household.
00:20:21.360,00:20:24.550,一点一滴留着心 便会管了,00:20:22.440,00:20:25.954,You will gradually become proficient.
00:20:25.000,00:20:27.270,是 臣妾愿意试试,00:20:26.180,00:20:28.549,"Yes, I will do my best."
00:20:29.200,00:20:29.950,这就对了,00:20:30.100,00:20:31.532,That's the spirit!
00:20:30.840,00:20:33.630,凡事就怕用心学,00:20:31.947,00:20:35.295,You can learn anything once you put your heart into it.
00:20:35.120,00:20:37.190,皇后三病两痛的,00:20:36.410,00:20:38.839,The Empress is not in good health
00:20:39.000,00:20:41.110,华妃终究毛躁气盛些,00:20:40.159,00:20:42.971,and Consort Fleur is too quick-tempered.
00:20:42.760,00:20:44.230,朕喜欢你稳重,00:20:43.801,00:20:45.801,I appreciate your stable personality.
00:20:45.760,00:20:46.740,你学着,,,
00:20:47.240,00:20:49.700,以后就能帮朕料理六宫的事,00:20:46.969,00:20:51.115,I hope one day you can help me manage the palace affairs.
00:20:53.640,00:20:56.100,小主 剪秋姑姑来了,00:20:54.753,00:20:57.569,"My Lady, Madam Autumn is here."
00:21:01.160,00:21:03.110,奴婢剪秋请小主的安,00:21:02.160,00:21:04.480,Peace to My Lady.
00:21:05.000,00:21:05.870,小主别动,,,
00:21:06.080,00:21:07.990,姑姑 怎么劳动您来了,00:21:05.800,00:21:07.236,"Please stay in bed, My Lady."
00:21:08.560,00:21:09.750,叫我怎么当得起,00:21:07.236,00:21:10.951,"Madam, what has led you to come here personally?"
00:21:10.360,00:21:11.390,皇后娘娘听说,,,
00:21:11.640,00:21:13.150,小主病了这么久还不好,,,
00:21:13.480,00:21:14.700,实在是放心不下,00:21:11.479,00:21:15.765,"My Lady, Her Majesty has heard that
you are not recovering and became worried about you."
00:21:14.920,00:21:16.310,就派奴婢过来瞧瞧,,,
00:21:16.920,00:21:18.230,多谢皇后关怀,00:21:16.029,00:21:17.764,She sent me here to visit you.
00:21:19.040,00:21:20.750,小主怎么瘦这么多呀,00:21:17.990,00:21:20.200,I thank Her Majesty for her concern.
00:21:21.360,00:21:22.420,太医怎么说的,00:21:20.491,00:21:22.279,You look gaunt and tired.
00:21:23.280,00:21:24.750,小主该喝药了,00:21:22.430,00:21:23.811,What did the doctor say?
,,,00:21:24.339,00:21:25.927,"My Lady, it's time for medicine."
00:21:46.400,00:21:47.270,小主,00:21:47.280,00:21:48.620,My Lady.
00:21:49.640,00:21:52.270,我家小主身子弱 又受了大惊吓,00:21:50.920,00:21:53.825,"My Lady's weak constitution is still suffering
from her recent fright."
00:21:52.840,00:21:54.870,这太医的药一天三次喝下去,,,
00:21:55.800,00:21:56.860,就是不见好,00:21:54.089,00:21:58.374,"She's been taking the medicine three times a day
but not showing signs of recovery."
00:21:59.960,00:22:01.670,这身上的病好得快,,,
00:22:02.400,00:22:04.700,可心病呢 却要心药医,00:22:01.079,00:22:05.940,"The herbs can treat illness of the body,
but there's no medicine for illness of the mind."
00:22:05.560,00:22:08.190,对了 夏常在的腿算是废了,00:22:06.774,00:22:09.689,Attendant Summer's legs are no longer functional.
00:22:08.760,00:22:10.710,太医说人还能活着,,,
00:22:10.920,00:22:12.030,就是不能走了,00:22:10.000,00:22:13.411,"The imperial doctors said she can still live
but not walk anymore."
00:22:12.720,00:22:14.750,华妃说她住在延禧宫不方便,,,
00:22:15.080,00:22:16.110,就叫挪去冷宫了,00:22:14.000,00:22:18.177,"Consort Fleur said it's inconvenient for her to stay
in the Palace of Prolonging Happiness
and sent her to the Cold Palace."
00:22:17.120,00:22:18.590,说来也真是可怜啊,,,
00:22:19.280,00:22:20.910,不过也怪她自己不争气,00:22:18.280,00:22:22.189,"It's a shame, but it's her own fault."
00:22:21.440,00:22:22.470,还拖累了小主,00:22:22.528,00:22:24.113,And you've been affected too.
00:22:24.280,00:22:27.430,是我自己胆子小 不怪夏常在,00:22:25.360,00:22:28.960,I'm too timid. I don't blame Attendant Xia.
00:22:28.160,00:22:29.380,当然不怪夏常在,,,
00:22:29.880,00:22:31.710,不过小主病得不是时候啊,00:22:29.299,00:22:33.052,"Of course, but you fell ill at the wrong time."
00:22:32.640,00:22:34.430,倒是让沈贵人占了先机,,,
00:22:35.120,00:22:36.590,最先得了宠幸,00:22:33.769,00:22:37.876,"Noble Lady Shen has taken advantage of it
and become the newest favored concubine."
00:22:37.480,00:22:38.990,实在是我福薄,,,
00:22:39.400,00:22:41.110,不如沈贵人得天独厚,00:22:38.480,00:22:40.409,I'm not as blessed.
00:22:42.480,00:22:44.390,若累得娘娘为我担心,00:22:40.409,00:22:42.740,I can't compare to Noble Lady Shen's Heavenly favor.
00:22:45.000,00:22:46.190,真是我的罪过,00:22:43.757,00:22:47.647,"But it would be my fault if I made
Her Majesty worried about me."
00:22:47.840,00:22:49.110,小主好好歇着吧,,,
00:22:49.520,00:22:50.660,奴婢先回景仁宫,00:22:48.880,00:22:50.336,"Rest well, My Lady."
00:22:51.120,00:22:52.230,改日再来看小主,00:22:50.638,00:22:53.449,I will return now and visit you another time.
00:22:53.800,00:22:54.550,康公公,,,
00:22:54.760,00:22:55.510,在,00:22:54.960,00:22:55.739,Mr. Kang.
00:22:56.320,00:22:57.270,好生送姑姑,00:22:55.739,00:22:56.644,Yes.
00:22:57.640,00:22:58.470,嗻,00:22:57.210,00:22:58.725,Please escort Madam out.
00:22:59.240,00:23:00.270,奴婢告退了,00:23:00.319,00:23:02.000,I take my leave.
00:23:06.160,00:23:08.510,这莞常在貌美如花,,,
00:23:09.640,00:23:11.190,却不想胆小如鼠,00:23:08.000,00:23:12.331,Attendant Sourire has the face of a flower but the heart of the mouse.
00:23:11.760,00:23:14.430,这也是个中看不中用的绣花枕头,00:23:12.670,00:23:15.860,"She's no more than the embroidered flowers
on a pillow: pretty, but useless."
00:23:14.920,00:23:17.710,她刚进宫 就看见血淋淋的,00:23:16.124,00:23:17.360,She's new to the palace
00:23:18.120,00:23:19.260,怎么不害怕,00:23:17.360,00:23:20.345,and saw such bloodshed - how could she not be frightened?
00:23:20.920,00:23:22.590,倒是那安答应,,,
00:23:22.840,00:23:25.790,看着娇怯怯的 倒还真没吓病着,00:23:21.978,00:23:25.125,That Companion An looks effete and timid.
00:23:26.680,00:23:27.790,华妃素日的阵仗,00:23:25.314,00:23:27.360,But she didn't get scared or ill.
00:23:28.080,00:23:29.140,你又不是没见过,00:23:27.360,00:23:30.400,Consort Fleur's demeanor is nothing new to you.
00:23:29.840,00:23:31.030,那日她来请安,,,
00:23:31.320,00:23:32.910,你虽是三阿哥的生母,00:23:30.400,00:23:33.960,"But even though you are the Third Prince's mother,
when she came to pay respects,"
00:23:33.160,00:23:35.670,你不也是要先和她问好吗,00:23:33.960,00:23:37.033,you had to bow to her first.
00:23:37.280,00:23:40.390,皇后是怪臣妾懦弱,00:23:38.360,00:23:41.994,Does Your Majesty blame me for being a coward?
00:23:41.120,00:23:44.630,可是三阿哥不得皇上钟爱,00:23:42.334,00:23:45.718,But the Third Prince isn't cherished by His Majesty.
00:23:44.960,00:23:47.310,臣妾又在皇上面前不得脸,,,
00:23:47.760,00:23:48.980,年纪又大了,00:23:46.020,00:23:50.000,"Nor does His Majesty value me, especially as I age."
00:23:49.440,00:23:52.110,哪比得上华妃呀年轻貌美的,,,
00:23:52.400,00:23:53.750,这又有年家撑腰,00:23:50.590,00:23:55.114,"I cannot compare to Consort Fleur's youth and beauty,
and her family's prominence."
00:23:54.400,00:23:56.030,你的眼光要放远些,,,
00:23:56.680,00:23:58.630,好歹你还有个三阿哥,00:23:55.529,00:23:59.969,"You should look further into the future.
You have the Third Prince, after all."
00:23:59.840,00:24:00.950,本宫的大阿哥,,,
00:24:01.200,00:24:03.350,和纯元皇后的二阿哥去得早,00:24:00.800,00:24:04.652,"We have lost my First Prince
and Empress Première's Second Prince."
00:24:03.600,00:24:05.350,三阿哥就是皇上的长子,00:24:04.803,00:24:06.803,The Third Prince is the eldest son now.
00:24:06.080,00:24:07.030,你现在的身份,,,
00:24:07.480,00:24:09.150,可比没有生养过的华妃,,,
00:24:09.440,00:24:10.470,要贵重多了,00:24:07.292,00:24:12.035,"Your status is much more distinguished
than the childless Consort Fleur."
00:24:12.400,00:24:13.430,话虽如此,,,
00:24:14.000,00:24:17.230,可是皇上不喜欢三阿哥呀,00:24:13.582,00:24:18.440,"I understand that, but His Majesty doesn't like the Third Prince."
00:24:17.440,00:24:18.310,皇上不喜欢三阿哥,,,
00:24:18.680,00:24:19.740,你就让他喜欢嘛,00:24:18.560,00:24:20.938,Then you must make it happen!
00:24:22.160,00:24:23.710,连你做额娘的都如此,,,
00:24:24.080,00:24:25.750,难怪三阿哥那么不长进,00:24:23.400,00:24:26.915,"With a mother like you,
no wonder the Third Prince hasn't learned much."
00:24:26.880,00:24:28.310,皇上已经数月,,,
00:24:29.360,00:24:31.350,不进臣妾的宫门半步了,00:24:28.009,00:24:32.695,But His Majesty hasn't stepped into my palace for months.
00:24:36.200,00:24:37.710,娘娘您瞧,00:24:37.320,00:24:38.887,"Your Highness, look."
00:24:38.480,00:24:40.750,这御花园虽然菊花开得多,,,
00:24:41.000,00:24:43.070,却不如咱们翊坤宫那些娇艳,00:24:39.604,00:24:44.120,"There are plenty of chrysanthemums in the Imperial Garden
but they are not as stunning as ours."
00:24:43.600,00:24:44.470,那是啊,,,
00:24:44.720,00:24:46.350,那什么地气养什么样的人哪,00:24:44.689,00:24:47.680,"Of course, the beauty of the flowers reflects the owner."
00:24:46.640,00:24:48.030,咱们翊坤宫的娘娘最美,,,
00:24:48.320,00:24:50.110,那花自然也是最美的呀,00:24:47.720,00:24:51.560,"Our palace has the most beautiful Consort.
Of course we have the most beautiful flowers."
00:24:51.040,00:24:53.910,嘴上抹蜜了 满嘴的胡诌,00:24:52.151,00:24:54.985,"Did you rub honey on your mouth today,
to butter me up like this?"
00:24:54.520,00:24:55.790,瞧我这张嘴呀,00:24:55.274,00:24:56.929,I have to slap my mouth
00:24:56.120,00:24:57.340,又惹娘娘不高兴了,00:24:56.929,00:24:58.639,for making Her Highness frown.
00:24:57.560,00:24:59.990,可是娘娘奴才说的是真的呀,00:24:58.639,00:25:01.280,"But Your Highness, I only spoke the truth."
00:25:04.560,00:25:06.030,娘娘快瞧那些菊花,,,
00:25:06.400,00:25:07.070,奴婢长这么大,,,
00:25:07.400,00:25:08.910,都没见过绿色的菊花呢,00:25:05.640,00:25:10.000,"Your Highness, I've never seen green chrysanthemums before!"
00:25:10.080,00:25:11.470,是挺特别的,,,
00:25:11.960,00:25:13.790,瞧花房的那些人急匆匆的,00:25:11.072,00:25:12.860,They are special indeed.
00:25:14.040,00:25:15.670,肯定是送到咱们翊坤宫去的,00:25:13.199,00:25:17.100,They must be in a hurry to deliver His Majesty's gifts to our palace.
00:25:17.280,00:25:18.910,既然是送给本宫的,,,
00:25:19.240,00:25:20.460,那便让他们停下来,00:25:18.473,00:25:21.453,"If the flowers are for me, they can stop here."
00:25:20.800,00:25:21.860,咱们也好看个新鲜,,,
00:25:22.040,00:25:22.790,是,00:25:21.776,00:25:23.680,We can look at them now.
00:25:23.240,00:25:23.870,你们过来,00:25:24.000,00:25:25.254,Come over here!
00:25:29.840,00:25:31.590,华妃娘娘金安,,,
00:25:31.800,00:25:32.470,起来吧,00:25:31.000,00:25:32.859,Peace to Your Highness.
00:25:37.200,00:25:38.310,华妃娘娘吉祥,00:25:32.859,00:25:33.704,Rise.
00:25:38.640,00:25:39.860,怎么走得那么慢哪,00:25:38.200,00:25:39.674,Peace to Your Highness.
,,,00:25:39.900,00:25:41.575,Why are you walking so slowly?
00:25:40.600,00:25:43.390,这绿菊贵重得连腿都抬不起来了,00:25:41.575,00:25:44.922,Are my green chrysanthemums too heavy for your arms?
00:25:44.560,00:25:46.830,有劳你们种出这么稀罕的花,00:25:45.790,00:25:48.285,"It must have taken a great deal of effort
to grow this rare flower."
00:25:47.160,00:25:48.110,就放这儿吧,00:25:48.285,00:25:49.600,Just leave them here.
00:25:51.120,00:25:51.990,华妃娘娘,,,
00:25:52.440,00:25:55.390,这菊花这菊花,00:25:52.500,00:25:56.680,Your Highness... the chrysanthemums ...
00:25:55.600,00:25:56.470,有话就回,00:25:56.680,00:25:57.840,Speak.
00:25:56.800,00:25:58.710,是送去存菊堂的,00:25:57.920,00:26:00.040,They are for the Chamber of Chrysanthemums.
00:26:04.520,00:26:05.630,那便送去吧,00:26:05.500,00:26:07.071,Then go.
00:26:06.240,00:26:08.310,华妃娘娘恕罪 华妃娘娘恕罪,00:26:07.260,00:26:09.620,I beg Your Highness's forgiveness.
00:26:10.160,00:26:11.910,娘娘恕罪 娘娘恕罪,,,
00:26:12.480,00:26:13.270,掌嘴,00:26:11.460,00:26:13.580,I beg Your Highness's forgiveness.
00:26:14.240,00:26:15.220,都怪奴婢不好,00:26:13.580,00:26:14.929,Slap yourself.
00:26:15.560,00:26:16.270,都怪奴婢不好,,,
00:26:16.600,00:26:17.430,都怪奴婢不好,,,
00:26:17.720,00:26:18.550,都怪奴婢不好,00:26:15.520,00:26:21.885,It was all my fault!
00:26:18.880,00:26:19.830,都怪奴婢不好,00:26:22.300,00:26:24.249,[Chamber of Chrysanthemums]
00:26:20.120,00:26:21.150,都怪奴婢不好,00:26:24.249,00:26:26.249,The writing looks so nice!
00:26:25.720,00:26:27.750,小主 这个匾真好看,00:26:26.500,00:26:28.856,"My Lady, the new plaque looks nice."
00:26:29.160,00:26:30.470,皇上说换就给换上了,,,
00:26:31.040,00:26:32.470,真是把小主放在心上啊,00:26:30.358,00:26:32.211,His Majesty had it replaced it so quickly.
00:26:33.560,00:26:35.750,这样的话别放在嘴上说了,00:26:32.211,00:26:34.000,He holds you in a special place in his heart.
00:26:36.200,00:26:37.470,叫人听见笑话,00:26:34.624,00:26:38.474,"Don't say such things out loud.
Others will mock us."
00:26:51.840,00:26:53.110,动作都快一点,,,
00:26:53.480,00:26:55.310,就这么几盆花搬了这么半天,00:26:53.240,00:26:54.335,Move faster!
00:26:56.880,00:26:57.910,以后翊坤宫上下,00:26:54.335,00:26:56.989,Why is it taking so long? It's just a few pots of flowers.
00:26:58.280,00:26:59.390,绝对不能再出现菊花,00:26:58.000,00:27:01.160,"I will have no chrysanthemums in my palace
ever again!"
00:27:01.240,00:27:02.300,快 搬走,00:27:02.163,00:27:04.309,"Move them, faster!"
00:27:09.880,00:27:11.020,离请安的时间还早,,,
00:27:11.320,00:27:12.110,小主慢慢走,00:27:11.000,00:27:13.400,"It is still early. Take your time, My Lady."
00:27:12.560,00:27:14.190,辇轿坐得骨头都僵了,,,
00:27:14.600,00:27:16.790,这样走走倒也舒坦,00:27:13.664,00:27:18.080,"It's more comfortable to walk.
My bones are stiff from sitting in the sedan."
00:27:19.680,00:27:21.270,你怎么回事啊 竟敢冲撞贵人,,,
00:27:21.600,00:27:22.740,奴才急着给敬事房送水,00:27:20.680,00:27:22.400,What's wrong with you?
00:27:23.120,00:27:24.070,实在无心冒犯贵人,00:27:22.640,00:27:25.118,"My Lady, I was in a hurry to deliver water.
I meant no offense."
00:27:24.320,00:27:25.230,好了好了 采月,,,
00:27:25.480,00:27:26.700,快陪我回去换身衣服吧,00:27:25.420,00:27:28.160,"Forget it, Lunar. We have to go back and get changed quickly."
00:27:27.080,00:27:28.590,要不来不及去请安了,,,
00:27:28.920,00:27:29.670,是,00:27:28.160,00:27:30.000,We can't be late to pay our respects.
00:27:36.360,00:27:38.230,沈贵人今儿来得好早啊,00:27:36.500,00:27:39.794,"Oh, Lady Shen arrived quite early today."
00:27:42.760,00:27:44.950,臣妾向皇后娘娘请安来迟了,,,
00:27:45.280,00:27:46.390,请娘娘恕罪,00:27:43.960,00:27:47.740,"I'm late to pay my respects to Your Majesty.
I entreat Your Majesty's pardon."
00:27:47.160,00:27:48.790,请安贵在有心,,,
00:27:49.040,00:27:51.420,偶尔一次没有什么的 起来吧,00:27:48.264,00:27:51.544,"Your respect is genuine.
It's all right if you're late occasionally."
00:27:52.280,00:27:53.230,谢娘娘,00:27:51.600,00:27:52.840,Rise.
00:27:53.880,00:27:54.790,赐座,00:27:53.204,00:27:54.736,I thank Your Majesty.
00:27:55.400,00:27:57.230,皇后娘娘果然体恤,00:27:55.000,00:27:56.220,Have a seat.
00:27:57.960,00:27:59.510,只是皇后厚爱,00:27:56.371,00:27:58.763,Your Majesty is very considerate.
00:28:00.040,00:28:01.990,怕是要宠坏了沈贵人,00:27:59.140,00:28:03.200,But your indulgence may spoil Noble Lady Shen
00:28:02.400,00:28:03.910,坏了六宫的规矩,,,
00:28:04.240,00:28:05.110,可不是吗,00:28:03.502,00:28:05.160,and the harem's discipline.
00:28:05.800,00:28:07.430,臣妾开句玩笑,00:28:05.220,00:28:06.615,Indeed.
00:28:07.960,00:28:10.340,是不是以后只要说自己有心,,,
00:28:10.880,00:28:13.110,就能不按规矩向中宫请安了呢,00:28:06.879,00:28:14.639,"Pardon my jesting, but are we exempt from paying
respects if we show ""genuine respect"" to Your Majesty?"
00:28:14.160,00:28:15.380,回禀皇后娘娘,,,
00:28:15.680,00:28:17.150,我们贵人并非有意晚了,00:28:15.280,00:28:18.440,"Your Majesty, My Lady was late for a reason."
00:28:17.440,00:28:18.390,而是在请安的路上,,,
00:28:18.720,00:28:20.110,被小太监无心弄脏了衣裳,,,
00:28:20.480,00:28:21.510,只能回宫去换,00:28:18.507,00:28:22.640,"A eunuch splashed water on her dress,
so we went back to change it."
00:28:21.760,00:28:23.550,有心也好 无意也罢,00:28:22.719,00:28:25.056,But she was still late.
00:28:23.800,00:28:26.830,错了就是错了 错了就该承担,00:28:25.056,00:28:28.160,She made a mistake and must bear the consequences.
00:28:32.920,00:28:35.830,皇后娘娘 沈贵人虽然有错,00:28:34.080,00:28:37.294,"Your Majesty, Lady Shen made a mistake"
00:28:36.120,00:28:38.150,但她一向侍奉娘娘勤谨,,,
00:28:38.480,00:28:40.390,还是请娘娘饶恕她一回吧,00:28:37.294,00:28:39.647,but she has always been diligent in her service to Your Majesty.
00:28:41.040,00:28:42.910,敬嫔是咸福宫主位,00:28:39.647,00:28:41.700,Please forgive her this time.
00:28:43.240,00:28:44.670,沈贵人有所错失,00:28:42.302,00:28:47.354,"You are the head of Lady Shen's palace,
and thus responsible for failing to guide her."
00:28:45.040,00:28:46.510,也是你教导不善所致,,,
00:28:48.840,00:28:50.470,一事论一事吧,00:28:50.220,00:28:52.320,Let's leave the matter as it is.
00:28:51.560,00:28:53.940,那妹妹你觉得该如何处理啊,00:28:52.659,00:28:55.360,"Fleur, how do you think we should resolve it?"
00:28:56.840,00:28:59.550,沈贵人恃宠而骄 藐视皇后,00:28:58.200,00:29:01.010,Lady Shen grew conceited over her favor and disrespected the Empress.
00:29:00.160,00:29:01.590,本该杖责三十,00:29:01.274,00:29:03.550,This offense warrants a thirty-lash flogging.
00:29:06.160,00:29:08.720,臣妾以为法外不外乎人情,00:29:07.302,00:29:10.040,But our kindness transcends the law.
00:29:09.560,00:29:11.510,姑念沈贵人是初犯,,,
00:29:11.880,00:29:13.430,就罚她两个月月俸吧,00:29:10.794,00:29:15.534,"Given that it's her first offense, Lady Shen will forfeit
her stipends for the next two months."
00:29:15.080,00:29:17.910,敬嫔教导不善 同罚两个月月俸,00:29:16.339,00:29:19.040,"For setting a poor example, Estime should also suffer
the same punishment."
00:29:21.800,00:29:23.430,皇后娘娘以为如何,00:29:22.940,00:29:25.280,What does Your Majesty think?
00:29:26.560,00:29:28.830,臣妾有错 甘愿领罚,,,
00:29:29.120,00:29:31.350,只是此事不关敬嫔娘娘之事,00:29:28.000,00:29:30.240,"Your Majesty, I am at fault and will accept my punishment."
00:29:31.640,00:29:32.780,还请娘娘体察,00:29:30.240,00:29:34.417,"But this matter does not involve Concubine Estime.
I hope Your Majesty will show leniency."
00:29:33.560,00:29:35.790,既然华妃已为本宫做了决定,,,
00:29:36.240,00:29:38.700,本宫也以为略施小诫即可,00:29:34.794,00:29:39.583,"As Consort Fleur suggested,
I agree that a light punishment is enough."
00:29:39.080,00:29:40.830,再过两个月便是年关,,,
00:29:41.240,00:29:43.110,停两个月月俸也不便,00:29:40.320,00:29:45.844,"It is the New Year in two months.
The forfeit will be one month instead."
00:29:43.360,00:29:44.500,就停一个月吧,,,
00:29:47.320,00:29:48.950,多谢皇后娘娘,,,
00:29:49.400,00:29:51.230,臣妾一定谨记于心 绝不再犯,00:29:48.600,00:29:52.520,"I thank Your Majesty.
I will remember and never make this mistake again."
00:29:52.120,00:29:53.100,都起来吧,00:29:53.000,00:29:54.260,You may rise.
00:29:53.760,00:29:54.980,谢皇后娘娘,00:29:54.700,00:29:56.160,I thank Your Majesty.
00:29:55.200,00:29:57.390,你们都累了 各自回宫吧,00:29:56.160,00:29:58.780,You all must be tired. You may retire.
00:30:00.800,00:30:02.430,臣妾告退,00:30:01.780,00:30:04.030,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:30:11.200,00:30:12.870,那臣妾也先告退了,00:30:12.242,00:30:14.243,"I'll take my leave too, Your Majesty."
00:30:13.240,00:30:16.310,其实今日的事何必如此重责呢,00:30:14.582,00:30:17.740,You didn't have to insist on a heavy punishment today.
00:30:17.040,00:30:18.710,那皇后以为该如何呢,,,
00:30:19.560,00:30:21.510,本宫与妹妹同为姐妹,00:30:18.306,00:30:20.260,What did Your Majesty think is suitable then?
00:30:21.920,00:30:24.350,因为妹妹一向侍奉本宫有心,00:30:20.960,00:30:22.992,You're like a sister to me in the imperial family.
00:30:24.720,00:30:27.870,所以本宫也无谓妹妹请安早晚,00:30:23.218,00:30:29.276,"Because you always have the heart to pay respects to me,
I do not mind what time you arrive."
00:30:29.600,00:30:31.870,皇后认为臣妾为难沈贵人了,00:30:30.895,00:30:33.440,So Your Majesty thinks I was too harsh on Noble Lady Shen?
00:30:32.840,00:30:34.630,皇后娘娘一向宽和,00:30:33.440,00:30:35.800,Your Majesty is generous by nature.
00:30:34.880,00:30:37.150,然而这宫中不比从前在王府,,,
00:30:37.480,00:30:39.750,皇上正因为知道娘娘心慈,00:30:35.800,00:30:38.855,"But the palace is nothing like the estate
we lived in when the Emperor was still a prince."
00:30:40.040,00:30:41.510,才让臣妾协理六宫,00:30:38.855,00:30:42.868,"His Majesty wanted me to assist in palace management
because he knows you are kind-hearted."
00:30:41.800,00:30:43.350,取宽严相济之道,,,
00:30:44.280,00:30:45.670,臣妾若不如此,00:30:42.868,00:30:44.868,So leniency is balanced with strictness.
00:30:46.240,00:30:48.620,岂不是辜负了皇上的一番信任,00:30:45.540,00:30:50.000,"If I failed to do so, wouldn't I be breaking His Majesty's trust?"
00:30:50.440,00:30:52.310,皇上让妹妹协理六宫,,,
00:30:52.560,00:30:55.190,就是认真妹妹堪真六宫表率,00:30:51.704,00:30:56.544,"His Majesty requested your assistance
because he believes you are exemplary to all the other concubines."
00:30:55.880,00:30:57.750,日后中宫请安呢,,,
00:30:58.080,00:30:59.300,还望妹妹早来,00:30:57.160,00:31:00.620,"In the future, I hope you can come early to pay respects."
00:31:01.760,00:31:03.430,臣妾自当牢记,,,
00:31:04.280,00:31:06.840,只是有时皇上垂爱,00:31:03.000,00:31:05.160,I will remember Your Majesty's advice.
00:31:07.360,00:31:09.310,一定要臣妾不必早起,00:31:05.386,00:31:10.446,"But His Majesty is considerate and
often insists that I sleep in."
00:31:09.960,00:31:11.070,请问娘娘,,,
00:31:11.600,00:31:14.470,到时臣妾是该听谁的呢,00:31:11.200,00:31:15.680,May I ask Your Majesty whose order I shall obey?
00:31:17.160,00:31:18.710,你我同为皇上的人,,,
00:31:19.080,00:31:20.670,自然一切以皇上为主,00:31:18.268,00:31:21.802,"We both serve His Majesty.
Naturally, we put His Majesty first."
00:31:23.200,00:31:24.790,皇后既有明示,,,
00:31:25.160,00:31:26.790,那臣妾就先告退了,00:31:24.317,00:31:28.114,"Since Your Majesty has given clear instructions,
I will take my leave now."
00:31:37.160,00:31:38.510,奴才有事回娘娘,,,
00:31:38.800,00:31:39.630,说,00:31:38.349,00:31:40.000,I came to report to Your Majesty.
00:31:40.760,00:31:43.030,福子的确是先被打昏,00:31:40.000,00:31:40.945,Speak.
00:31:43.360,00:31:44.390,再扔进井里的,00:31:42.060,00:31:45.536,"As suspected, Fuzi was deliberately killed."
00:31:44.760,00:31:45.550,当真,,,
00:31:45.880,00:31:46.790,有伤痕为证,00:31:45.800,00:31:46.900,Really?
00:31:47.080,00:31:49.710,福子的颈子和头上都受了重伤,00:31:46.900,00:31:50.900,The bruises on her neck and forehead are evidence.
00:31:50.000,00:31:51.430,且当日有人看见,,,
00:31:51.680,00:31:53.750,皇上去翊坤宫与福子说话,,,
00:31:54.040,00:31:56.270,华妃当时就不高兴了,00:31:51.051,00:31:57.551,"And Consort Fleur's displeasure was observed
when His Majesty talked to Fuzi that night."
00:31:57.680,00:31:59.510,华妃越来越放肆了,00:31:58.900,00:32:00.931,Her behaviour is getting more and more audacious!
00:32:01.280,00:32:04.070,你将这话如实禀报给皇上,00:32:02.500,00:32:05.383,Report this truthfully to His Majesty.
00:32:04.800,00:32:05.470,嗻,00:32:05.911,00:32:06.779,Yes.
00:32:14.400,00:32:16.230,把敬事房的记档给本宫拿来,00:32:15.490,00:32:17.420,I need to see the records for the Attendance Services.
00:32:16.480,00:32:18.110,周公公已经送过来了,00:32:17.420,00:32:19.380,It has been sent here for Your Highness.
00:32:37.240,00:32:39.540,这个月沈贵人侍寝两次,00:32:38.774,00:32:41.274,"Lady Shen - twice this month,"
00:32:40.440,00:32:42.270,连富察贵人也是两次,00:32:41.500,00:32:43.760,and twice for Lady Fuca.
00:32:43.160,00:32:44.220,还真不少啊,00:32:44.099,00:32:45.732,That's quite a lot.
00:32:45.600,00:32:47.590,和娘娘相比 不算多,00:32:46.750,00:32:49.000,Not at all compared to Your Highness.
00:32:48.040,00:32:48.830,可是这个月,,,
00:32:49.160,00:32:50.950,皇上一共就来了后宫七次,00:32:49.060,00:32:52.420,"But His Majesty has only visited the harem
seven times this month."
00:32:51.840,00:32:53.310,还是未雨绸缪的好,00:32:52.759,00:32:54.875,"I have to ""mend the windows before it rains."""
00:32:54.640,00:32:56.830,省得日后她们恃宠若骄,,,
00:32:57.760,00:32:59.350,本宫想管都管不了了,00:32:55.743,00:33:00.640,"In case they grow conceited over favor
and get out of control."
00:33:02.000,00:33:04.150,皇上不是最重满汉一家吗,00:33:03.143,00:33:06.041,His Majesty values the unity between the Manchu and Han peoples.
00:33:06.080,00:33:07.630,去把富察贵人请来,00:33:07.181,00:33:09.042,Bring Lady Fuca here.
00:33:08.360,00:33:10.230,本宫自当好好教她,00:33:09.532,00:33:11.520,I'll teach her a lesson.
,,,00:33:20.000,00:33:22.661,(Noble Lady Fuca)
00:33:11.040,00:33:11.710,是,,,
00:33:29.080,00:33:32.030,皇上常说满汉是一家,00:33:30.000,00:33:33.530,His Majesty often says that Manchus and Hans are one family.
00:33:33.080,00:33:35.790,你们伺候皇上不能不懂汉文,00:33:34.134,00:33:37.180,"As a Manchu concubine, you must also know the Han script."
00:33:36.560,00:33:38.150,皇上写字的时候,,,
00:33:38.360,00:33:40.350,你们就要伺候在一边研墨,00:33:37.746,00:33:41.527,"When His Majesty is writing,
you have to grind the ink by his side."
00:33:41.440,00:33:43.590,这研墨可是门功夫,00:33:42.820,00:33:44.988,Grinding ink is an acquired skill.
00:33:44.040,00:33:45.430,你得好好学,00:33:44.988,00:33:46.724,You have to learn it properly.
00:33:47.440,00:33:48.230,是,00:33:48.421,00:33:49.540,Yes.
00:33:51.360,00:33:53.630,本宫教你都是为了你好,00:33:52.520,00:33:55.140,Everything I teach you is for your own good.
00:33:55.240,00:33:57.670,别以为磨这一个时辰就够了,00:33:56.640,00:33:59.240,Grinding for only two hours is not enough.
00:33:58.280,00:34:00.030,这工夫还远着呢,00:33:59.349,00:34:01.779,There's still a long way to go.
00:34:07.800,00:34:10.910,青海罗卜藏丹津叛乱,00:34:09.585,00:34:12.877,"Luobu Zangdan has revolted in Qinghai Province,"
00:34:12.120,00:34:13.550,西北局势不稳,00:34:13.217,00:34:15.274,threatening the stability in the Northwest.
00:34:15.320,00:34:16.150,张廷玉,00:34:16.479,00:34:18.075,"Zhang Tingyu,"
00:34:17.480,00:34:21.020,你以为朝中何人可以前去平定,00:34:18.641,00:34:22.507,who do you think is suitable for pacifying the rebellion?
00:34:21.480,00:34:25.180,皇上 臣以为论用兵论亲疏,00:34:22.560,00:34:26.495,"Your Majesty, in terms of affinity and military deployment,"
00:34:25.480,00:34:26.950,眼下唯有一人可用,,,
00:34:27.280,00:34:28.110,年羹尧,00:34:26.560,00:34:28.496,there is only one candidate.
00:34:28.600,00:34:29.430,皇上圣明,00:34:28.520,00:34:29.821,Nian Gengyao.
00:34:30.160,00:34:31.710,皇上登基不满一年,00:34:29.821,00:34:31.224,Your Majesty is wise.
00:34:31.960,00:34:34.390,八王九王之势尚未完全消除,00:34:31.639,00:34:35.519,"The influence of your brothers, Lord VIII and Lord IX,
has not been fully eliminated."
00:34:35.080,00:34:37.310,年羹尧是华妃娘娘的长兄,,,
00:34:37.800,00:34:39.470,掌管西陲军务多年,00:34:36.161,00:34:40.880,"General Nian is the brother of Consort Fleur, and
has managed the military affairs in the West for a long time."
00:34:39.880,00:34:41.550,所以臣以为,,,
00:34:41.800,00:34:43.430,年羹尧是最合适的人选,00:34:41.091,00:34:44.800,"Therefore, he is the most suitable candidate in my opinion."
00:34:43.720,00:34:45.790,年羹尧的确为朕的江山,,,
00:34:46.160,00:34:47.470,立下了汗马功劳,00:34:44.880,00:34:49.612,"Nian Gengyao has indeed made
significant contributions to my throne,"
00:34:49.440,00:34:52.870,可是他如今在西北大权独揽,00:34:50.555,00:34:54.361,but his power has grown unchecked in the Northwest.
00:34:53.440,00:34:56.630,左都督岳钟琪系岳飞二十一世孙,00:34:54.625,00:34:58.003,"The Deputy Commander, Yue Zhongqi
is a descendant of the great general Yue Fei."
00:34:57.000,00:34:58.350,熟悉西北边事,,,
00:34:58.760,00:35:00.470,人称常胜将军,00:34:58.080,00:35:02.200,"He is knowledgeable about Northwestern affairs
and known as the Ever-Victorious General."
00:35:00.960,00:35:04.550,且一贯周敏勤慎 不妨,00:35:02.275,00:35:04.731,He is always modest and diligent.
00:35:04.800,00:35:07.990,好 那朕就命年羹尧,00:35:04.882,00:35:06.014,Perhaps...
00:35:08.320,00:35:09.830,接任抚远大将军,00:35:06.014,00:35:11.287,"Very well. I hereby appoint Nian Gengyao as Pacification General-in-Chief,"
00:35:10.600,00:35:14.030,岳钟琪为奋武将军参赞军务,00:35:11.740,00:35:15.765,and Yue Zhongqi as the Counselor-in-Chief.
00:35:14.560,00:35:16.270,前往青海平叛,00:35:15.765,00:35:17.500,They will proceed to Qinghai.
00:35:16.840,00:35:18.150,臣遵旨,00:35:18.141,00:35:19.712,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:35:27.200,00:35:30.150,皇上 翊坤宫的周宁海,,,
00:35:30.640,00:35:32.710,带着华妃娘娘送来的点心,00:35:28.453,00:35:35.377,"Your Majesty, Zhou Ninghai from the Palace of Earthly Honor has
brought you pastries from Her Highness Consort Fleur."
00:35:33.080,00:35:34.590,说要请皇上品尝,,,
00:35:34.920,00:35:35.830,让他搁那儿吧,,,
00:35:36.240,00:35:36.910,嗻,00:35:35.984,00:35:37.540,Let him leave the pastries.
,,,00:35:37.540,00:35:38.333,Aye.
00:35:39.160,00:35:43.390,联记得吉林将军进贡了一壶东珠,00:35:40.812,00:35:44.640,I remember receiving eastern pearls from Jilin.
00:35:44.600,00:35:48.630,你亲自去给华妃送去,00:35:45.560,00:35:49.900,You will send her the pearls personally.
00:35:49.520,00:35:54.350,说朕嘉奖她协理六宫 办事周到,00:35:50.654,00:35:55.740,"Say that I commend her for
her thoughtful assistance in palace management."
00:35:54.960,00:35:55.630,嗻,00:35:56.042,00:35:56.873,Aye.
00:36:00.640,00:36:02.870,夜深了 小主早些歇息吧,00:36:02.000,00:36:04.490,"It's late now. You should rest early, My Lady."
00:36:04.360,00:36:05.310,我今儿不困,,,
00:36:07.360,00:36:08.710,难得小主精神好,00:36:05.470,00:36:07.156,I'm not tired today.
00:36:09.000,00:36:09.980,这么晚了也不困,00:36:08.561,00:36:11.040,You're rarely in such good spirits.
00:36:10.800,00:36:12.310,自从小主生病以后,,,
00:36:12.680,00:36:14.030,除了沈贵人 安答应,,,
00:36:14.440,00:36:15.660,和淳常在常来看望外,00:36:11.957,00:36:16.822,"Since you fell sick,
except for Lady Shen, Attendant Chun, and Companion An,"
00:36:16.160,00:36:18.110,连阿猫阿狗都没有再上门的了,00:36:17.237,00:36:20.132,even the wild cats and dogs have stopped visiting.
00:36:20.560,00:36:21.470,这几日啊,,,
00:36:22.080,00:36:24.270,我见那些宫女太监们都懒懒的,00:36:21.802,00:36:25.730,"These past few days, I've noticed that the palace maids and eunuchs seem listless."
00:36:24.680,00:36:26.030,我才嘱咐他们几句,,,
00:36:26.440,00:36:28.310,连小印子都敢跟我拌嘴了,00:36:25.881,00:36:29.528,"When I give them instructions,
even Xiao-Yinzi started to talk back to me."
00:36:28.680,00:36:29.790,情理之中的事,00:36:29.722,00:36:31.504,That's not surprising.
00:36:30.560,00:36:33.270,他们愿做就做 不愿做也罢了,00:36:31.843,00:36:34.427,"If they don't want to work, leave them be."
00:36:33.440,00:36:34.230,是,00:36:34.616,00:36:35.296,Yes.
00:36:37.120,00:36:40.150,浣碧你听 好像有谁在哭,00:36:38.319,00:36:40.034,"Jade, do you hear that?"
00:36:46.880,00:36:48.230,是小允子的声音,00:36:40.223,00:36:41.401,Someone's crying.
00:36:48.760,00:36:50.470,今儿是他在廊下守夜呢,00:36:48.141,00:36:51.808,It's Xiao-Yunzi. He's on night duty in the corridor.
00:36:51.560,00:36:52.270,去瞧瞧,00:36:52.800,00:36:54.220,Let's go see him.
00:37:01.080,00:37:03.190,好好的 怎么哭得那么伤心,00:37:02.073,00:37:04.700,What is wrong? Why are you crying so sadly?
00:37:04.480,00:37:06.590,奴才叨扰小主 小主恕罪,00:37:05.605,00:37:08.281,"Please forgive me for disturbing you, My Lady."
00:37:09.120,00:37:10.390,人有喜怒哀乐,,,
00:37:10.680,00:37:12.110,伤心流泪何罪之有,00:37:10.311,00:37:13.345,"We all feel joy and sorrow.
Shedding tears is hardly a crime."
00:37:12.720,00:37:14.350,你且告诉我 为什么哭,,,
00:37:15.040,00:37:16.990,奴才的哥哥在四执库当差,00:37:13.873,00:37:16.028,"Tell me, why are you crying?"
00:37:17.680,00:37:19.470,病了一个多月了都没见好,00:37:16.179,00:37:18.644,My elder brother also works in the palace.
00:37:20.440,00:37:21.660,所以奴才伤心,00:37:18.833,00:37:22.861,"He's been gravely ill for over a month.
That's why I'm so worried about him."
00:37:22.040,00:37:24.270,人食五谷杂粮难免有病痛,00:37:23.200,00:37:25.589,"We all ""eat the five grains"" and sickness can follow."
00:37:25.760,00:37:27.110,左右这两日闲着,,,
00:37:27.520,00:37:28.740,你去照顾你哥哥吧,00:37:26.984,00:37:30.496,"Not much work is needed here these days.
You can go and take care of your brother."
00:37:29.640,00:37:30.510,多谢小主,,,
00:37:32.680,00:37:34.550,小主 天凉了,00:37:30.798,00:37:32.480,"Thank you, My Lady!"
00:37:34.840,00:37:35.750,我们赶紧回去吧,00:37:33.875,00:37:37.240,"My Lady, it's cold out here. Let's go inside."
00:37:36.160,00:37:37.910,时候不早了 早点歇息,,,
00:37:38.440,00:37:39.190,嗻,00:37:37.240,00:37:40.302,It's late. You should rest early.
00:37:44.920,00:37:46.750,皇上这几日政务劳累,,,
00:37:47.080,00:37:48.870,臣妾让人炖了湘莲燕窝,00:37:45.959,00:37:48.234,Your Majesty has been toiling with state affairs lately.
00:37:49.240,00:37:50.270,滋润清火,00:37:48.460,00:37:51.644,"I had bird's nest soup prepared with lotus seeds
for Your Majesty. It can clear internal heat."
00:37:50.560,00:37:51.700,皇上多喝些,00:37:51.644,00:37:52.927,Please have some.
00:38:03.640,00:38:04.620,皇后有心了,00:38:04.402,00:38:06.580,I appreciate your thoughtfulness.
00:38:06.520,00:38:08.980,福子的事江福海已向皇上禀报,00:38:07.712,00:38:10.699,Jiang Fuhai has reported Fuzi's death to Your Majesty.
00:38:10.360,00:38:11.270,这后宫里,,,
00:38:11.600,00:38:13.670,争风吃醋的事情真是不少,00:38:11.453,00:38:15.040,The harem is infested with jealous rivalries.
00:38:14.080,00:38:17.270,臣妾无方 还请皇上示下,00:38:15.135,00:38:18.280,I hope Your Majesty can enlighten me on what to do.
00:38:17.520,00:38:18.870,朕知道你说的是谁,00:38:18.371,00:38:20.568,I know who you're referring to.
00:38:19.960,00:38:22.030,后宫难免争风吃醋,00:38:21.058,00:38:23.680,But jealousy is inevitable in the harem.
00:38:23.320,00:38:25.590,若非她们对联有情,,,
00:38:26.160,00:38:27.830,也不会有这么多的是非,00:38:24.344,00:38:29.342,"Without their affection for me,
there wouldn't be so many rivalries."
00:38:28.640,00:38:30.470,朕不忍苛责,00:38:29.719,00:38:32.223,I don't have the heart to punish that.
00:38:31.760,00:38:33.710,你也要耐心调停,00:38:32.827,00:38:35.139,You should patiently reconcile them.
00:38:34.120,00:38:34.950,是,00:38:35.290,00:38:36.234,Yes.
00:38:37.160,00:38:38.790,燕窝润肺,00:38:38.000,00:38:40.798,Bird's nest soup is a nourishing treat.
00:38:40.320,00:38:44.910,已经入冬了 皇后也要多进补啊,00:38:41.175,00:38:46.423,You should have some more supplements in the winter as well.
00:38:45.560,00:38:46.830,谢皇上关怀,00:38:46.763,00:38:48.527,I thank Your Majesty.
00:38:50.480,00:38:54.100,对了 莞常在的病怎么样了,00:38:51.597,00:38:55.261,"By the way, is Attendant Sourire getting better?"
00:38:56.560,00:38:59.310,温太医的医术一向为人称许,00:38:57.826,00:39:00.553,Dr. Wenhas always been praised for his medical skills.
00:38:59.640,00:39:03.070,只是莞常在的病依旧是不见起色,00:39:00.817,00:39:04.309,"However, Attendant Sourire's condition has not improved."
00:39:03.480,00:39:05.110,想来病去如抽丝,,,
00:39:05.400,00:39:06.350,正如太医所说,00:39:04.762,00:39:07.540,"Recovering from an illness is as slow as
reeling cocoons into silk."
00:39:06.680,00:39:08.110,莞常在气弱体虚,,,
00:39:08.360,00:39:09.830,还需要时日调养,00:39:07.540,00:39:11.385,"The doctor said Attendant Sourire needs more time
to recuperate, given her weak constitution."
00:39:10.920,00:39:14.190,既如此 就让她安心养着吧,00:39:12.215,00:39:15.494,"In that case, she'll recuperate peacefully."
00:39:14.640,00:39:15.470,是,00:39:15.871,00:39:16.702,Yes.
00:39:16.440,00:39:18.070,你瞅你们一个一个那样,00:39:17.500,00:39:19.661,You should each take a look at yourselves.
00:39:18.560,00:39:20.510,垂头丧气的给谁看呢,00:39:19.661,00:39:21.860,Enough with your downcast faces!
00:39:21.680,00:39:24.270,师傅 您瞧常在那个样子,00:39:22.841,00:39:26.016,"Shifu [how apprentices address their master],
you should look at Attendant Sourire."
00:39:24.760,00:39:26.070,都是当奴才的,,,
00:39:26.400,00:39:28.030,别人的奴才多神气,00:39:26.016,00:39:29.310,"While the servants in other palaces look spirited,"
00:39:28.600,00:39:30.070,咱们也太没劲了,00:39:29.600,00:39:31.185,we have no life here.
00:39:31.320,00:39:32.630,你以真我就有脸了,00:39:32.403,00:39:34.296,No life? I'm left with no pride!
00:39:33.680,00:39:35.980,富察贵人身边小遊子算什么东西,00:39:35.012,00:39:37.776,"Xiao-Youzi used to be nothing in the palace,"
00:39:36.920,00:39:40.460,仗着小主得宠敢跟我称兄道弟,00:39:38.115,00:39:42.048,"but now he sees himself as equal to me
since Lady Fuca is in favor."
00:39:41.200,00:39:42.310,也不想想,,,
00:39:42.840,00:39:45.470,狗东西 给我提鞋都不配,00:39:42.539,00:39:46.720,That bastard isn't even good enough to carry my shoes!
00:39:47.280,00:39:49.840,说来啊 就是小主自己不争气,00:39:48.540,00:39:51.096,It's all due to our mistress's incompetence!
00:39:50.600,00:39:52.630,都治了两个月了不见好,,,
00:39:52.880,00:39:55.310,前两日 我听温太医的口风,00:39:51.888,00:39:54.012,She's been sick for two months.
00:39:56.000,00:39:57.390,怕是还要养许久,00:39:54.012,00:39:58.400,"From what Dr. Wen said the other day,
it sounded like her situation would last long."
00:39:58.120,00:39:59.510,怕是得了痨症吧,,,
00:39:59.760,00:40:00.550,别胡说,00:39:59.230,00:40:00.815,Is this a fatal disease?
00:40:01.760,00:40:02.980,我瞧小主的样子,00:40:00.815,00:40:02.240,Nonsense!
00:40:03.640,00:40:06.350,好了也是病容残损 得不了盛宠,00:40:03.180,00:40:07.516,"Even if My Lady recovers, she'll still look unwell,
unable to gain His Majesty's favor."
00:40:07.040,00:40:09.390,还连累咱们也做奴才中的奴才,00:40:07.969,00:40:10.453,"We will become ""the servants of the servants"" in the palace."
00:40:09.680,00:40:12.240,你说这碎玉轩也太晦气了,00:40:10.680,00:40:12.985,The Palace of Pearl Jade is cursed.
00:40:13.720,00:40:15.230,赔进一个芳贵人,,,
00:40:15.680,00:40:17.910,又赔进一个病病歪歪的莞常在,00:40:14.930,00:40:19.860,"It ruined Lady Parfum, and soon Attendant Sourire."
00:40:19.320,00:40:22.430,不行 咱们不能跟她葬在这儿,00:40:20.388,00:40:23.593,"No, this palace can't be the living tomb
we're buried in."
00:40:23.920,00:40:25.630,还请师傅多提点徒弟,00:40:25.040,00:40:27.240,"Sir, we will follow your advice."
00:40:26.440,00:40:27.660,以后机灵点就行了,00:40:27.466,00:40:29.440,My advice is to be smarter.
00:40:28.280,00:40:31.950,师傅 今日该您轮着当差了吧,00:40:29.626,00:40:33.260,"Sir, it's your turn to be on shift today."
00:40:33.280,00:40:34.590,她病着少动弹,,,
00:40:35.360,00:40:36.390,我不去能怎么着,00:40:34.429,00:40:38.001,She's ill and inactive. Why bother?
00:40:37.920,00:40:39.630,倒是该筹谋着,,,
00:40:39.960,00:40:41.870,上哪儿找位新小主了,00:40:38.885,00:40:43.053,But it's time to find another mistress to work for.
00:40:49.560,00:40:50.830,小主要喝碗热茶,,,
00:40:51.120,00:40:51.990,你怎么还不端来,00:40:50.620,00:40:53.223,My Lady wanted to have some tea. Why is it taking so long?
00:40:52.600,00:40:53.550,要喝茶水,,,
00:40:53.800,00:40:56.030,自然要先发了炉子再烧水了,00:40:53.713,00:40:57.098,I have to light the stove and boil the water first.
00:40:56.360,00:40:57.310,让小主再等会儿吧,,,
00:40:57.600,00:40:59.830,还有了 这个月内务府,00:40:57.098,00:40:58.591,My Lady will have to wait.
00:41:00.120,00:41:01.870,连小主份例的茶叶都没送来,00:40:58.591,00:41:03.475,"Also, the Household Department didn't send
the tea allotted to her this month."
00:41:02.520,00:41:04.310,等下小主只能喝水了,00:41:03.664,00:41:05.807,My Lady will only have hot water later.
00:41:05.320,00:41:07.070,昨儿我见你喝的水里还有茶叶,,,
00:41:07.520,00:41:08.790,怎到小主这儿就没了,00:41:06.562,00:41:10.284,"I saw tea leaves in your cup yesterday.
How is there no tea left for My Lady?"
00:41:09.520,00:41:11.230,难不成是被你自己喝了,,,
00:41:11.760,00:41:12.630,这是在宫里,00:41:10.560,00:41:12.856,Did you make all the tea for yourself?
00:41:12.920,00:41:14.470,你说话做事要有凭据的,00:41:12.856,00:41:15.794,"This is the palace.
You need evidence when you make such claims."
00:41:15.040,00:41:16.390,还以为这是在你们府里呢,00:41:16.209,00:41:17.967,You're not living at home anymore.
00:41:18.720,00:41:19.550,佩儿,00:41:20.000,00:41:20.966,Violet.
00:41:20.920,00:41:22.990,那流朱姑娘是小主的贴身侍婢,00:41:22.135,00:41:24.305,Vermilion is My Lady's dowry maid.
00:41:23.400,00:41:24.110,你在宫中多年,,,
00:41:24.480,00:41:25.590,怎么这样不识礼数,,,
00:41:26.080,00:41:27.350,赶紧去烧茶水来,00:41:24.494,00:41:27.404,"You've been in the palace for a long time.
How can you be so disrespectful?"
00:41:27.880,00:41:29.910,若茶叶没了 去内务府领取啊,00:41:27.404,00:41:29.114,Make the tea now.
,,,00:41:29.114,00:41:31.564,"If the tea leaves have run out,
collect them from the Household Department."
00:41:38.560,00:41:41.020,常在这个样子怕是好不了了,00:41:39.663,00:41:42.480,"If Attendant Sourire is like this, it's probably incurable."
00:41:41.720,00:41:43.550,师傅既得了丽嫔的喜欢,,,
00:41:43.800,00:41:44.990,还求师傅可怜我,00:41:43.008,00:41:46.560,"Shifu, since you've gained favor from
Concubine Beauté, please let me follow you."
00:41:48.840,00:41:50.230,公公既寻得好的出路,,,
00:41:50.560,00:41:51.870,怎藏着掖着不告知小姐,00:41:49.830,00:41:53.202,"Mr. Kang, if you've found a good place to go,

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;

Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
