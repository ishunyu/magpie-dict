00:02:23.560,00:02:25.720,小主放心得过端妃吗,00:02:23.740,00:02:25.900,"My Lady, do you really trust Consort Honnête?"
00:02:27.180,00:02:29.470,用人不疑 疑人不用,00:02:27.360,00:02:29.650,"""Only use those you trust, never the ones you suspect."""
00:02:29.730,00:02:31.590,皇上驾到,00:02:29.650,00:02:32.309,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:02:35.860,00:02:37.190,皇上万福金安,00:02:36.040,00:02:37.592,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:02:37.860,00:02:38.440,快起来吧,,,
00:02:38.700,00:02:39.310,谢皇上,00:02:38.040,00:02:40.000,"- Rise.
- I thank Your Majesty."
00:02:42.820,00:02:44.230,皇上怎么这个时候过来,00:02:43.000,00:02:44.632,What brings Your Majesty here at this time?
00:02:44.910,00:02:45.990,倒吓了人家一跳,00:02:45.090,00:02:46.436,Your Majesty surprises me.
00:02:49.920,00:02:51.660,小轩窗 正梳妆,00:02:50.100,00:02:52.760,"""By the little carved window, she was combing and adorning herself."""
00:02:52.580,00:02:55.200,原来是这样安静融洽的光景,00:02:52.760,00:02:55.602,Now I know what a peaceful and harmonious sight that is.
00:02:55.960,00:02:57.290,怎么这个时候篦头发,00:02:56.140,00:02:58.003,Why are you combing your hair at this time?
00:02:58.470,00:03:01.000,皇上方才进来时仿佛很高兴,00:02:58.650,00:03:01.491,Your Majesty seemed very happy when you came in.
00:03:01.890,00:03:04.130,有什么高兴事也告诉臣妾,00:03:02.070,00:03:06.130,"Will Your Majesty tell me the happy news
so I can share the feeling with you?"
00:03:04.430,00:03:05.890,也好叫臣妾一同乐一乐,,,
00:03:06.520,00:03:08.550,嬛嬛果真是心细如发,00:03:06.700,00:03:09.130,"Huan Huan, your senses are as refined as your hair."
00:03:10.350,00:03:13.090,早朝的时候大臣们上了奏章,00:03:10.530,00:03:11.895,"In court this morning,"
00:03:13.810,00:03:16.060,说起今秋钱粮颇丰,00:03:11.895,00:03:16.496,officials reported a surplus in revenue and food supplies for this year.
00:03:16.780,00:03:18.690,百姓们也都安居乐业,00:03:16.960,00:03:18.870,The people can live a happy and stable life now.
00:03:19.030,00:03:20.230,朕听了很高兴,00:03:19.210,00:03:20.721,I am very happy to hear that.
00:03:21.150,00:03:22.640,昨夜又去看了端妃,00:03:21.330,00:03:22.820,I also visited Consort Honnête yesterday night.
00:03:23.070,00:03:24.900,端妃平时沉默寡言,00:03:23.250,00:03:25.080,"Consort Honnête is typically taciturn,"
00:03:25.490,00:03:28.660,偶尔说起几句倒是很入情入理,00:03:25.404,00:03:28.840,but she is quite reasonable when she does voice her opinion.
00:03:31.160,00:03:33.660,端妃娘娘久在宫中见识深远,00:03:31.340,00:03:33.929,"Consort Honnête is wise and knowledgeable
because of her long residency in the palace."
00:03:34.330,00:03:36.670,而皇上素来宽仁待下,00:03:34.510,00:03:39.292,"And Your Majesty has always been benevolent to all,
making wise decisions on both household and external affairs."
00:03:37.300,00:03:38.910,对内对外都是英明睿智,,,
00:03:39.420,00:03:41.040,才得今日百业昌盛,00:03:39.600,00:03:42.463,That's why the country enjoys prosperity and stability today.
00:03:41.260,00:03:42.370,百姓安定的局面,,,
00:03:43.180,00:03:45.590,臣妾眼见前朝稳固,00:03:43.360,00:03:45.770,"As I witness the stability in the court,"
00:03:47.060,00:03:49.010,遥想当年纯元皇后为福晋,00:03:47.240,00:03:50.611,"I try to picture when Empress Première
was leading your lord concubines."
00:03:49.350,00:03:50.460,治理王府的风姿,,,
00:03:51.520,00:03:53.430,若是今日纯元皇后还在,00:03:51.700,00:03:53.836,"If Empress Première was still with us today,"
00:03:54.190,00:03:56.800,后宫更会气象一新,00:03:54.370,00:03:56.980,I believe the ambiance of the harem would be much different.
00:03:57.360,00:03:59.100,你听过纯元皇后的事,00:03:57.540,00:03:59.502,You've heard accounts of Empress Première?
00:04:00.490,00:04:01.570,槿汐入宫早,00:04:00.670,00:04:02.040,Jinxi entered the palace early.
00:04:02.240,00:04:03.650,在臣妾身边侍奉时,,,
00:04:04.160,00:04:05.860,常常会说起纯元皇后,00:04:02.109,00:04:07.426,"She often told me how Empress Première
bestowed grace upon all the servants."
00:04:06.160,00:04:07.240,施惠上下的恩泽,,,
00:04:08.160,00:04:09.530,说句犯上冒昧的话,00:04:08.340,00:04:10.302,"Although this may sound presumptuous,"
00:04:10.500,00:04:12.160,若是今日纯元皇后还在,00:04:10.680,00:04:12.566,"if Empress Première was still alive,"
00:04:13.210,00:04:14.790,那槿汐与苏培盛之事,,,
00:04:15.420,00:04:16.580,又会如何处置呢,00:04:13.390,00:04:17.101,"how would Her Majesty resolve the affair
between Jinxi and Su Peisheng?"
00:04:18.210,00:04:20.000,若纯元还在,00:04:18.390,00:04:20.180,If Empress Première was still alive...
00:04:20.420,00:04:21.500,臣妾想,,,
00:04:22.050,00:04:24.790,当今皇后是纯元皇后的亲妹妹,00:04:20.600,00:04:24.610,The Empress is the younger sister of Empress Première.
00:04:25.340,00:04:27.080,彼此性情自然是一路的,00:04:25.520,00:04:27.627,I assume Their Majesties shared the same disposition.
00:04:28.560,00:04:30.170,皇后娘娘虽说,,,
00:04:30.470,00:04:32.970,要以槿汐与苏培盛之事惩戒后宫,00:04:28.740,00:04:33.369,"Although Her Majesty intends to use this incident
as a warning to the harem,"
,,,00:04:33.910,00:04:34.536,I suppose...
00:04:33.730,00:04:36.810,大约也不会真要了他们的性命吧,00:04:35.070,00:04:37.524,Her Majesty will not actually take their lives.
00:04:38.320,00:04:39.930,何况皇上宽仁待下,00:04:38.500,00:04:40.110,"Especially given Your Majesty's benevolence,"
00:04:40.650,00:04:41.690,想必皇后娘娘,00:04:40.830,00:04:41.959,I'm sure Her Majesty
00:04:42.280,00:04:44.020,绝不会与皇上言行相悖,,,
00:04:44.490,00:04:46.070,更不会与纯元皇后相悖,00:04:42.403,00:04:46.467,"will not act in contradiction to Your Majesty
and Empress Première's inclinations."
00:04:46.820,00:04:49.940,宜修如何能与纯元相提并论,00:04:47.000,00:04:50.120,How can Yixiu compare to Empress Première?
00:04:51.410,00:04:53.990,朕想着你怀着双生胎辛苦,00:04:51.590,00:04:54.245,I have been thinking it must be exhausting for you to carry twins.
00:04:54.830,00:04:56.070,宫中却纷传,,,
00:04:56.580,00:04:58.920,你腹中之子并非朕的孩子,00:04:55.010,00:04:59.136,"Yet, the palace is filled with rumors that you are not carrying my children."
00:04:59.590,00:05:00.620,旁人便罢了,00:04:59.770,00:05:01.395,"I don't mind what others say,"
00:05:01.420,00:05:04.080,竟然连皇后也要朕留心,00:05:01.600,00:05:04.793,but even the Empress has also mentioned it.
00:05:06.640,00:05:08.420,皇后娘娘也只是,00:05:06.820,00:05:10.243,Her Majesty is justly concerned about the affairs of the harem.
00:05:08.720,00:05:10.090,关心后宫之事罢了,,,
00:05:10.680,00:05:12.470,端妃有句话说得很是,00:05:10.860,00:05:12.872,Consort Honnête was correct.
00:05:13.140,00:05:15.850,宫中现在有两位嫔妃有孕,00:05:13.320,00:05:16.030,"With two concubines pregnant,"
00:05:16.650,00:05:19.230,哪里能见得这样生死打杀的东西,00:05:16.830,00:05:19.543,the palace shouldn't see any bloodshed.
00:05:19.900,00:05:22.180,即便要罚也该缓一缓,00:05:20.080,00:05:22.360,"Even if they should be punished, it should be postponed."
00:05:22.860,00:05:24.140,皇上方才问小主,,,
00:05:24.400,00:05:25.770,为何这个时候才篦头,00:05:23.040,00:05:26.051,"Earlier, Your Majesty asked My Lady why she was combing her hair at this time."
00:05:26.070,00:05:26.940,原是有缘故的,00:05:26.250,00:05:27.386,There is a reason for it.
00:05:27.410,00:05:29.740,槿汐出事小主又气又伤心,00:05:27.386,00:05:30.186,Jinxi's situation has upset and saddened My Lady.
00:05:30.200,00:05:31.780,已经有两天没有睡好觉了,00:05:30.380,00:05:31.960,It's been two days since My Lady got a decent night's sleep.
00:05:32.620,00:05:33.980,还是温太医的法子好,,,
00:05:34.410,00:05:36.450,说用篦子梳梳头可以松缓精神,00:05:32.800,00:05:37.437,"Dr. Wen suggested combing the hair
can help calm anxiety and improve sleep."
00:05:36.790,00:05:37.500,可以睡得好一些,,,
00:05:37.710,00:05:38.370,多嘴,00:05:37.480,00:05:38.994,Quiet.
00:05:39.130,00:05:40.580,谁让你在皇上面前嚼舌根的,00:05:39.310,00:05:41.248,"Who gave you permission to ""chew your tongue"" before His Majesty?"
00:05:42.380,00:05:44.540,皇上您别听浣碧乱说,00:05:42.560,00:05:44.720,"Your Majesty, don't listen to Jade."
00:05:45.260,00:05:46.960,臣妾没事睡得很好,00:05:45.440,00:05:47.291,I have been sleeping very well.
00:05:47.680,00:05:48.760,你还要瞒朕吗,00:05:47.860,00:05:49.251,You still want to deceive me?
00:05:50.100,00:05:51.300,看你眼下的乌青,,,
00:05:51.640,00:05:52.970,就知道你一定没睡好,00:05:50.280,00:05:53.440,I can tell you haven't slept well by the dark circles under your eyes.
00:05:54.140,00:05:57.630,嬛嬛 你一味委曲求全,00:05:54.320,00:05:57.810,"Huan Huan, you always make compromises"
00:05:58.440,00:06:00.720,还要拦着浣碧不许说实话,00:05:58.620,00:06:01.255,and even forbid Jade from telling the truth.
00:06:02.650,00:06:04.510,臣妾能再度侍奉皇上身边,00:06:02.830,00:06:05.622,It's already a blessing for me to serve Your Majesty again.
00:06:04.780,00:06:05.610,已是万幸,,,
00:06:05.860,00:06:07.070,受些委屈又何妨,00:06:06.040,00:06:07.960,It's of no concern that sometimes I need to make compromises.
00:06:08.570,00:06:12.060,只是槿汐她陪在臣妾身边多年,00:06:08.750,00:06:12.434,But I just can't bear to see Jinxi suffer
00:06:12.780,00:06:15.530,臣妾心里总会有些舍不得,00:06:12.774,00:06:15.868,as she has been by my side all these years.
00:06:16.750,00:06:19.360,这说到底总是槿汐的不是,00:06:16.930,00:06:19.806,"However, I understand Jinxi is at fault here."
00:06:20.380,00:06:21.910,皇后娘娘是后宫之主,00:06:20.560,00:06:22.090,Her Majesty is the head of the harem.
00:06:23.040,00:06:24.710,她若真想要以宫规处置,00:06:23.220,00:06:24.890,"If she wants to punish Jinxi by the palace rules,"
00:06:25.340,00:06:28.170,臣妾也奈何不了只得听从,00:06:25.520,00:06:28.350,there is nothing I can do but obey.
00:06:28.590,00:06:31.380,纵然后宫由皇后掌管,00:06:28.770,00:06:31.560,"Though the Empress is in charge of the harem,"
00:06:31.760,00:06:34.720,难不成朕就不许过问了吗,00:06:31.940,00:06:34.900,I can always step in.
00:06:35.850,00:06:38.260,皇上切勿因此迁怒了皇后娘娘,00:06:36.030,00:06:38.704,Your Majesty must not vent anger on Her Majesty over this.
00:06:39.190,00:06:40.550,皇上要怪就怪臣妾,00:06:39.370,00:06:40.956,I am the only one to blame.
00:06:41.190,00:06:42.300,没有管教好宫人,00:06:41.370,00:06:42.480,I failed to properly instruct my servant.
00:06:43.110,00:06:45.560,这样的事朝朝代代都有,00:06:43.290,00:06:46.003,This kind of thing has happened in every dynasty.
00:06:46.320,00:06:47.480,不是到了朕这里,,,
00:06:47.740,00:06:49.150,才开天辟地第一桩,00:06:46.500,00:06:50.000,"Ever since ""heaven and earth were separated,""
these relationships have existed."
00:06:50.740,00:06:54.110,论起来他们都是饮食男女,00:06:50.920,00:06:54.290,They are just normal men and women with human desires.
00:06:55.080,00:06:57.440,太监虽算不得男人,00:06:55.260,00:06:57.620,"Though eunuchs don't count as men,"
00:06:58.160,00:07:00.070,也总是有人的情意,00:06:58.340,00:07:00.250,they still have human affection.
00:07:01.080,00:07:03.820,朕又何必如此灭人欲,00:07:01.260,00:07:04.000,I shouldn't try to extinguish their human desires.
00:07:05.670,00:07:06.790,其实此事,,,
00:07:07.260,00:07:09.250,说起来总是宫墙之内的事,00:07:05.774,00:07:09.625,"This incident, after all, happened within these palace walls."
00:07:10.430,00:07:12.040,稍稍遮掩过去就是了,00:07:10.610,00:07:12.220,It's better to solve it quietly.
00:07:13.050,00:07:15.010,若是大肆张扬到了臣民耳中,00:07:13.230,00:07:15.190,"If we let this draw too much attention from the citizenry,"
00:07:15.310,00:07:16.340,岂非叫人笑话,00:07:15.490,00:07:16.520,it will only give rise to ridicule.
00:07:17.140,00:07:19.510,且苏培盛是自小服侍皇上的人,00:07:17.320,00:07:19.690,"Besides, Su Peisheng has been serving Your Majesty since your childhood."
00:07:20.640,00:07:22.010,朝夕相处的时候,00:07:20.820,00:07:22.190,He has spent more days and nights by Your Majesty's side
00:07:22.650,00:07:24.230,只怕比臣妾还多上许多,00:07:22.830,00:07:24.410,than I have.
00:07:25.150,00:07:26.680,也算是功过相抵了,00:07:25.330,00:07:26.860,His hard work should offset one mistake.
00:07:27.230,00:07:28.560,什么朝夕相处,00:07:27.410,00:07:29.268,"""Spent more days and nights by my side""?"
00:07:29.360,00:07:31.980,这话听起来倒像是吃醋一般,00:07:29.540,00:07:32.160,It sounds like you are jealous of him.
00:07:32.660,00:07:36.320,真真是唯女子与小人难养也,00:07:32.840,00:07:36.500,"It's true that ""Only women and small men are hard to deal with."""
00:07:37.330,00:07:38.410,嬛嬛是女子,00:07:37.510,00:07:38.590,"I am a woman,"
00:07:39.000,00:07:40.330,肚子里的是小人儿,00:07:39.180,00:07:40.510,with small men in my belly.
00:07:40.910,00:07:42.120,皇上既觉得难养,00:07:41.090,00:07:42.300,"If Your Majesty thinks we are hard to deal with,"
00:07:42.790,00:07:43.830,那就不养也罢了,00:07:42.970,00:07:44.010,then just leave us alone.
00:07:44.920,00:07:46.160,朕哪里舍得,00:07:45.100,00:07:46.340,How can I bear to do that?
00:07:55.220,00:07:56.050,槿汐,00:07:55.400,00:07:56.230,Jinxi!
00:07:56.970,00:08:00.010,娘娘 娘娘,00:07:57.150,00:07:57.920,Your Highness!
00:08:00.600,00:08:01.210,回来就好,00:07:59.281,00:08:00.190,Your Highness...
00:08:01.480,00:08:02.010,娘娘可好,00:08:00.640,00:08:02.560,"- It's good that you're back.
- How is Your Highness?"
00:08:02.270,00:08:04.260,回来就好 回来就好啊,00:08:02.806,00:08:04.796,"Good, good to see you back."
00:08:04.600,00:08:05.430,请娘娘恕罪,00:08:04.796,00:08:05.800,"Your Highness, please forgive me."
00:08:05.730,00:08:06.590,快起来快起来,00:08:05.910,00:08:06.770,"Rise, quickly!"
00:08:07.980,00:08:08.770,皇上说了,00:08:08.160,00:08:08.950,His Majesty said that
00:08:09.320,00:08:10.900,只罚一年的月钱算是惩罚,00:08:09.500,00:08:11.080,your punishment is just one year's stipend.
00:08:11.820,00:08:13.030,人好好的就好,00:08:12.000,00:08:13.550,"As long as you're fine, nothing else matters."
00:08:14.820,00:08:17.160,谢娘娘恩德 谢皇上恩德,00:08:15.000,00:08:17.340,I'm thankful for Your Highness and His Majesty's grace.
00:08:19.540,00:08:21.620,你扶槿汐回屋子里去歇息吧,00:08:19.720,00:08:21.838,Go with Jinxi and help her get some rest.
00:08:22.250,00:08:24.110,这两日就不用过来伺候了,00:08:22.619,00:08:24.479,You don't need to serve me these two days.
00:08:25.080,00:08:29.290,奴婢没事 苏培盛呢,00:08:25.260,00:08:26.528,"I'm all right, Your Highness."
,,,00:08:28.301,00:08:29.470,How is Su Peisheng?
00:08:29.750,00:08:32.210,都好已经回养心殿去伺候了,00:08:29.930,00:08:32.390,All is well. He's already back to work at the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:08:34.510,00:08:35.460,快去休息吧,00:08:34.690,00:08:35.840,Go have some rest.
00:08:35.840,00:08:36.380,谢娘娘,00:08:36.020,00:08:36.560,I thank Your Highness.
00:08:36.510,00:08:38.250,浣碧 扶槿汐进去休息,00:08:36.690,00:08:38.430,"Jade, help Jinxi get rested."
00:08:39.220,00:08:39.930,走吧,00:08:39.400,00:08:40.110,Let's go.
00:09:05.420,00:09:08.160,奴才苏培盛给皇上请安,00:09:05.600,00:09:08.751,Su Peisheng... bows before Your Majesty.
00:09:10.300,00:09:11.750,皇上万福金安,00:09:10.260,00:09:12.033,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:09:12.920,00:09:13.630,回来了,00:09:13.100,00:09:13.810,You are back.
00:09:14.510,00:09:15.540,奴才多谢皇上,00:09:14.690,00:09:15.871,I thank Your Majesty.
00:09:16.130,00:09:18.250,粉身碎骨难报皇上大恩,00:09:16.310,00:09:18.921,Even sacrificing my life would not repay Your Majesty's grace.
00:09:19.300,00:09:20.890,回来就好研墨,00:09:19.480,00:09:21.296,Good to have you back. Now grind ink.
00:09:21.930,00:09:22.510,嘛,00:09:22.110,00:09:22.690,Yes.
00:09:25.600,00:09:27.640,皇上您先用完银耳羹,00:09:25.780,00:09:27.895,"Your Majesty, please have some cloud ear soup first."
00:09:28.230,00:09:29.590,奴才这就替您研墨,00:09:28.410,00:09:30.000,I will prepare your ink right away.
00:09:46.410,00:09:48.250,朕知道你想问什么,00:09:46.590,00:09:48.430,I know what you want to ask.
00:09:49.040,00:09:52.160,永寿宫没事崔槿汐也没事,00:09:49.220,00:09:52.340,The Palace of Eternal Longevity and Cui Jinxi are both fine.
00:09:53.550,00:09:56.000,朕罚了你们一年的月银,00:09:53.730,00:09:56.180,I punished you both with a fine of one year's stipend.
00:09:56.300,00:09:57.290,小惩大戒,00:09:56.480,00:09:58.149,A small punishment to prevent you from making a bigger mistake.
00:09:58.470,00:09:59.800,这样不体面的事,00:09:58.650,00:10:00.622,I have to take the Empress's opinion into account
00:10:00.140,00:10:02.500,朕不能不顾及皇后的道理,00:10:00.622,00:10:02.680,on this kind of inappropriate matter.
00:10:03.310,00:10:04.420,得表个态度出来,00:10:03.490,00:10:04.751,I need to demonstrate my stance.
00:10:05.350,00:10:06.090,奴才明白,00:10:05.530,00:10:06.685,"Your Majesty, I understand."
00:10:10.940,00:10:13.900,这样的事也不早让朕知道,00:10:11.120,00:10:14.080,You should have told me earlier.
00:10:17.700,00:10:20.480,奴才是怕这样的事说出来,00:10:17.880,00:10:20.660,I'm afraid that this kind of matter
00:10:21.070,00:10:22.440,污了皇上的耳朵,00:10:21.250,00:10:22.880,would soil Your Majesty's ears.
00:10:22.700,00:10:25.160,算了以后别再来往了,00:10:22.880,00:10:25.340,Forget it. Don't stay in personal contact with her anymore.
00:10:25.500,00:10:26.830,没得再落人口舌,00:10:25.680,00:10:27.010,In case there are gossips again.
,,,00:10:30.430,00:10:31.775,"Your Majesty,"
00:10:30.250,00:10:35.840,皇上奴才和槿汐老早就相识,00:10:33.246,00:10:36.020,Jinxi and I have known each other for a long time
00:10:36.170,00:10:36.960,又是同乡,00:10:36.350,00:10:37.744,and we're from the same hometown.
00:10:38.380,00:10:39.340,奴才老了,00:10:38.560,00:10:40.125,I'm getting old.
00:10:40.510,00:10:42.800,挨了一刀的家伙没儿没女的,00:10:40.502,00:10:42.691,I've taken the cut and will never have children.
00:10:43.640,00:10:44.840,也不配有人送终,00:10:43.585,00:10:45.284,I deserve no one by my death bed.
00:10:45.640,00:10:48.930,奴才只想和槿汐就个伴,00:10:45.820,00:10:47.280,I just want to...
,,,00:10:48.016,00:10:49.600,have Jinxi's company.
,,,00:10:50.910,00:10:52.032,Your Majesty...
00:10:50.730,00:10:54.720,皇上奴才是当真的,00:10:53.315,00:10:54.900,I'm sincere.
00:10:58.900,00:10:59.560,好吧,00:10:59.080,00:11:00.000,All right.
00:11:01.200,00:11:03.030,就当朕没说过这个话,00:11:01.380,00:11:03.210,Forget what I said just now.
00:11:03.370,00:11:04.570,也没听见你说什么,00:11:03.550,00:11:04.750,Nor did I hear what you said.
00:11:05.450,00:11:06.440,你自己看着办吧,00:11:05.630,00:11:06.620,Have it your own way.
00:11:07.450,00:11:10.790,奴才谢皇上大恩 谢皇上,00:11:07.630,00:11:09.839,I thank Your Majesty for the great grace.
,,,00:11:09.839,00:11:10.970,I thank Your Majesty.
00:11:15.840,00:11:17.080,给各位小主请安,00:11:16.020,00:11:17.373,Peace to My Ladies.
00:11:18.260,00:11:19.090,娘娘刚起,00:11:18.440,00:11:19.440,Her Majesty just got up.
00:11:19.260,00:11:20.870,请各位小主稍后来请安,00:11:19.440,00:11:21.050,Please come back later to pay your respects.
00:11:21.260,00:11:23.220,娘娘这里的菊花开得正好,00:11:21.440,00:11:23.400,The chrysanthemums here are in full bloom.
00:11:23.680,00:11:25.290,臣妾们在这里赏花,00:11:23.860,00:11:25.470,We'll enjoy the flowers in the courtyard
00:11:25.810,00:11:27.590,让娘娘不必着急,00:11:25.990,00:11:27.770,so that Her Majesty can take her time.
00:11:27.970,00:11:29.260,各位小主自娱便是,00:11:28.150,00:11:29.440,"As you please, My Ladies."
00:11:32.400,00:11:33.680,姐姐方才说得真是,00:11:32.580,00:11:34.124,What you said is so true.
00:11:34.270,00:11:35.260,有什么样的主子,,,
00:11:35.770,00:11:36.890,就有什么样的奴才,00:11:34.450,00:11:37.040,"Like master, like servant."
00:11:38.570,00:11:39.980,这事闹得沸沸扬扬,00:11:38.750,00:11:40.160,The whole thing caused an uproar.
00:11:40.740,00:11:43.150,我看熹妃如何收回这个脸面,00:11:40.920,00:11:43.952,I want to see how Consort Lumiere can save face.
00:11:44.410,00:11:46.440,还如何收拾得起脸面哪,00:11:44.590,00:11:46.620,How can she save face?
00:11:46.780,00:11:48.120,丢得满宫都是了,00:11:46.960,00:11:48.489,She won't find it anywhere in the harem!
00:11:48.830,00:11:51.490,我要是她就主仆俩一起躲起来,00:11:49.010,00:11:53.960,"If I were her, my servant and I would hide together
and never leave the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:11:51.960,00:11:53.790,再不出永寿宫的大门,,,
00:11:58.380,00:11:59.960,崔槿汐是她的心腹,00:11:58.560,00:12:00.366,Cui Jinxi is her trusted subordinate.
00:12:00.720,00:12:02.750,保不定这东西是她自己,00:12:00.900,00:12:04.280,Perhaps she needed that sachet to seduce His Majesty.
00:12:03.050,00:12:04.130,用来勾引皇上的呢,,,
00:12:04.680,00:12:07.380,只不过是底下人替她保管着罢了,00:12:04.860,00:12:07.560,She just had the servant keep it for her.
00:12:22.740,00:12:24.730,熹妃娘娘金安,00:12:22.920,00:12:24.910,Peace to Your Highness Consort Lumiere.
00:12:28.330,00:12:30.940,还未恭喜祺贵人终于放出来了,00:12:28.155,00:12:31.608,"I haven't gotten a chance to congratulate you, Lady Delice -
you are finally released from confinement."
00:12:36.580,00:12:39.670,想必祺贵人禁足时一定是闷坏了,00:12:36.760,00:12:39.850,You must've been extremely bored when confined.
00:12:40.590,00:12:42.420,一出来就往人堆里扎,00:12:40.770,00:12:42.864,Jumping into the crowd the minute you're released.
00:12:45.340,00:12:47.630,谁是谁非娘娘心里明镜似的,00:12:45.520,00:12:47.810,Your Highness has eyes like mirrors to see what's right and wrong.
00:12:48.300,00:12:50.760,何必指鹿为马颠倒黑白呢,00:12:48.480,00:12:50.940,"No need to ""call a stag a horse"" or ""describe black as white""."
00:12:57.860,00:12:59.190,皇后娘娘开恩,,,
00:12:59.820,00:13:01.520,为了八月中秋团圆,00:12:58.040,00:13:01.856,Her Majesty made the request to His Majesty for you to be released
00:13:02.490,00:13:04.730,特地求了皇上把祺贵人放出来,00:13:01.856,00:13:04.880,so we can reunite for the Mid-Autumn Festival.
00:13:05.700,00:13:07.360,以为祺贵人长了教训,00:13:05.880,00:13:07.840,"I thought you learned your lesson,"
00:13:08.320,00:13:09.560,不想还是这么毛躁,00:13:08.500,00:13:09.740,but you're still so quick to lose your temper.
00:13:10.540,00:13:12.030,当真是白费苦心了,00:13:10.720,00:13:12.663,What a terrible waste of Her Majesty's good intentions!
00:13:13.000,00:13:14.160,嫔妾有什么不是,,,
00:13:14.460,00:13:15.410,也只是自己的不是,00:13:13.180,00:13:15.560,"It's my own mistake if I did something wrong,"
00:13:16.370,00:13:17.780,比不得娘娘身边的人,00:13:16.550,00:13:18.220,"which is nothing compared to Your Highness's servant,"
00:13:18.040,00:13:19.620,做出这等没脸面的事来,00:13:18.220,00:13:19.800,who did such a shameless thing.
00:13:21.210,00:13:24.550,可不知是不是上梁不正下梁歪啊,00:13:21.390,00:13:24.843,"I wonder if it's ""because the top beam is crooked, the entire house is twisted."""
00:13:33.270,00:13:35.930,奴婢前两日病着不能起身,00:13:33.450,00:13:36.261,"For the past few days, I've been sick and unable to get up."
00:13:36.640,00:13:39.730,如今既好了便赶来服侍娘娘了,00:13:36.820,00:13:39.910,"Now that I am better, I came to serve Your Highness."
00:13:42.900,00:13:43.730,我来吧,00:13:43.080,00:13:44.023,Allow me.
00:13:46.360,00:13:48.980,浣碧也是早起天凉,00:13:46.540,00:13:51.520,"Jade, you should have carried a cape for Her Highness on such a cold morning."
00:13:49.450,00:13:51.360,怎么不知道给娘娘带个披肩呢,,,
00:13:52.200,00:13:54.990,万一真冻病了皇上又要心疼了,00:13:52.380,00:13:55.170,His Majesty will worry if Her Highness gets sick.
00:13:59.880,00:14:01.240,祺贵人身为宫嫔,,,
00:14:02.130,00:14:05.540,方才的话是该对熹妃娘娘说的吗,00:14:00.060,00:14:05.720,"Lady Délice, as a concubine, is it appropriate for you
to speak to Her Highness Consort Lumière in this way?"
00:14:06.470,00:14:08.580,所谓上梁不正下梁歪,00:14:06.650,00:14:09.454,"You say ""The top beam is crooked, so the entire house is twisted""."
00:14:09.010,00:14:11.470,那么熹妃娘娘身为妃位,00:14:09.454,00:14:13.640,But Consort Lumière ranks as Consort while you're just a Noble Lady -
00:14:12.140,00:14:13.420,小主只是个贵人,,,
00:14:14.020,00:14:16.850,总该知道尊卑有别吧,00:14:14.200,00:14:17.385,at least you should know the difference between superiors and inferiors.
00:14:17.730,00:14:21.220,再说了小主当日苛待宫人,00:14:17.910,00:14:22.280,"Moreover, when you mistreated your residents the other day,"
00:14:22.150,00:14:23.640,难道也是熹妃娘娘,,,
00:14:23.980,00:14:25.470,上梁不正的缘故吗,00:14:22.280,00:14:25.613,"do you also blame ""an upper beam that was crooked""?"
00:14:26.150,00:14:28.610,小主也未免有些太强词夺理了,00:14:26.330,00:14:28.800,You can twist your words but they won't be the truth.
00:14:28.860,00:14:30.400,强词夺理的是你崔槿汐,00:14:29.040,00:14:30.880,"You are the one twisting the words, Cui Jinxi!"
00:14:30.700,00:14:31.980,明明是你秽乱宫闱,00:14:30.880,00:14:32.960,You are the one who desecrated the harem!
00:14:32.780,00:14:35.490,奴婢与苏培盛是交好,00:14:32.960,00:14:35.670,"Yes, I'm on good terms with Su Peisheng."
00:14:36.120,00:14:37.030,可那又怎样,00:14:36.300,00:14:37.399,"Well, what of it?"
00:14:38.040,00:14:39.500,小主纵然不喜欢,00:14:38.220,00:14:39.831,"Even if you don't like it,"
00:14:40.290,00:14:42.700,恕奴婢出慎刑司的人是皇上,00:14:40.470,00:14:42.880,it was His Majesty who released me.
00:14:43.630,00:14:46.170,所以秽乱宫闱四个字,00:14:43.810,00:14:48.320,"Therefore, I do not deserve the accusation of ""desecrating the harem""."
00:14:46.590,00:14:48.080,奴婢万万担当不起,,,
00:14:48.880,00:14:51.120,小主若硬说奴婢是秽乱宫闱,00:14:49.060,00:14:51.300,"If you insist on this,"
00:14:51.760,00:14:54.380,那岂不是暗指皇上包庇了奴婢,00:14:51.940,00:14:54.560,are you implying that His Majesty sheltered me
00:14:54.760,00:14:56.130,纵容宫中大乱,00:14:54.940,00:14:56.310,and allowed me to create disorder in the palace?
00:14:58.680,00:14:59.970,那么你们的心思呢,00:14:58.860,00:15:00.301,So what do you all think?
00:15:00.690,00:15:01.930,也和祺贵人一般吗,00:15:00.870,00:15:02.110,Do you share the same mind as Lady Délice?
00:15:02.860,00:15:03.890,嫔妾不敢,00:15:03.040,00:15:04.280,"We dare not, Your Highness."
00:15:05.570,00:15:06.730,皇后娘娘已经起来了,00:15:05.750,00:15:06.910,Her Majesty is ready.
00:15:07.110,00:15:08.230,请各位小主进去呢,00:15:07.290,00:15:08.599,"My Ladies, please come in."
00:15:17.040,00:15:19.320,今天槿汐也来了,00:15:17.220,00:15:19.500,"Ah, Jinxi is here."
00:15:19.710,00:15:21.200,是皇后娘娘,00:15:19.890,00:15:21.380,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:15:21.750,00:15:23.960,伺候熹妃娘娘是奴婢的本分,00:15:21.930,00:15:24.140,It's my duty to serve Consort Lumiere.
00:15:24.710,00:15:27.250,槿汐呀你可是宫中的老人儿了,00:15:24.890,00:15:27.430,"Jinxi, you're senior in the palace."
00:15:27.880,00:15:30.960,以后服侍着熹妃应该格外上心,00:15:28.060,00:15:31.140,You should serve Consort Lumiere with extra care.
00:15:31.220,00:15:32.630,别惹出什么事端来,,,
00:15:32.930,00:15:34.460,叫熹妃烦心才是,00:15:31.400,00:15:34.800,Don't cause any more trouble and upset her.
00:15:35.180,00:15:38.170,是多谢皇后娘娘指点,00:15:35.360,00:15:38.350,Yes. I thank Your Majesty for your guidance.
00:15:39.270,00:15:40.430,中秋将至,00:15:39.450,00:15:40.610,The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching.
00:15:40.890,00:15:43.560,听闻果郡王很快就会回京了,00:15:41.070,00:15:43.740,Noble Prince Guo is coming back to the capital.
00:15:44.230,00:15:46.220,加之熹妃产期将近,00:15:44.410,00:15:46.400,"Besides, Consort Lumiere will deliver her child soon,"
00:15:47.020,00:15:48.610,惠嫔也有了身孕,00:15:47.200,00:15:48.790,and Concubine Vertu is pregnant.
00:15:48.820,00:15:51.810,皇上的意思是要好好操办,00:15:49.000,00:15:51.990,His Majesty wants a proper celebration.
00:15:53.360,00:15:55.200,但凭娘娘做主,,,
00:15:55.530,00:15:57.520,臣妾等不胜欢欣,00:15:53.540,00:15:57.980,We will be delighted to follow your arrangement.
00:16:04.080,00:16:06.540,奴才苏培盛给娘娘请安,00:16:04.260,00:16:06.720,Su Peisheng bows before Your Highness.
00:16:06.960,00:16:07.620,你来了,00:16:07.140,00:16:07.800,You're here.
00:16:09.130,00:16:11.460,皇上让奴才送一品红枣雪蛤来,00:16:09.310,00:16:12.760,"His Majesty asked me to bring a serving of
red dates and hasma to nourish Your Highness's health."
00:16:11.800,00:16:12.580,给娘娘补身,,,
00:16:15.050,00:16:16.130,多谢皇上心意,00:16:15.230,00:16:16.310,I thank His Majesty.
00:16:17.760,00:16:18.840,公公也辛苦了,00:16:17.940,00:16:19.020,"Thank you too, sir."
00:16:20.890,00:16:22.380,浣碧赐座,00:16:21.070,00:16:22.560,"Jade, grant Mr. Su a seat."
00:16:23.560,00:16:24.300,多谢娘娘,00:16:23.740,00:16:24.706,I thank Your Highness.
00:16:32.820,00:16:35.440,数日不见公公清减了不少,00:16:33.000,00:16:35.620,"I haven't seen you for a few days, sir.
You have slimmed down a lot."
00:16:37.580,00:16:38.360,奴才本以为,,,
00:16:38.620,00:16:40.360,自个儿的身子还挺强健的呢,00:16:37.760,00:16:40.520,I thought I was pretty strong and healthy.
00:16:41.040,00:16:43.370,没想到只到慎刑司数日,00:16:41.220,00:16:43.550,I didn't expect to become feeble like this
00:16:43.540,00:16:44.750,做了几天的粗活,,,
00:16:45.420,00:16:46.830,身子就这么不济了,00:16:43.720,00:16:47.000,after several days of hard labor work in the Department of Penalty.
00:16:47.750,00:16:49.290,真是老了不中用了,00:16:47.930,00:16:49.470,I'm indeed old and useless.
00:16:52.090,00:16:54.300,奴才如今还是回到皇上的身边,00:16:52.270,00:16:56.920,"Since I'm still serving His Majesty, no one dares gossip."
00:16:54.880,00:16:56.750,倒也不敢有人说三道四的,00:16:57.900,00:16:59.343,But ...
00:16:57.720,00:17:01.010,只是槿汐那边,00:16:59.720,00:17:01.190,How are things with Jinxi?
00:17:01.430,00:17:02.550,公公心知肚明,00:17:01.610,00:17:02.919,"I'm sure your heart can see it, sir,"
00:17:03.850,00:17:05.510,槿汐会被人说三道四,,,
00:17:05.900,00:17:07.850,也是因为她在本宫身边的缘故,00:17:04.030,00:17:08.000,"the reason so many people gossip about Jinxi
is that she works for me."
00:17:09.440,00:17:11.930,此次的事虽说是公公一不小心,,,
00:17:12.490,00:17:14.980,掉出了那枚缨络才闹出的事端,00:17:09.620,00:17:15.160,The incident was only because you accidentally dropped the sachet.
00:17:16.110,00:17:17.690,本宫一力想保住你们二人,00:17:16.290,00:17:19.200,I endeavored to protect the two of you and I was at my wits' end.
00:17:18.030,00:17:19.020,却也无计可施,,,
00:17:20.160,00:17:21.900,好在皇上顾念旧情,00:17:20.340,00:17:22.080,"Fortunately, His Majesty took into account your past service."
00:17:22.410,00:17:23.030,是啊,00:17:22.590,00:17:23.323,Yes.
00:17:24.710,00:17:25.950,奴才一时疏忽,00:17:24.890,00:17:26.130,I was careless.
00:17:26.830,00:17:29.320,没想到就连带皇后娘娘也上了心,00:17:27.010,00:17:29.500,I didn't expect that even Her Majesty the Empress would become involved.
00:17:31.340,00:17:32.870,奴才会谨记教训的,00:17:31.520,00:17:33.125,I'll keep this lesson in mind.
00:17:33.800,00:17:35.660,这个教训不仅公公要谨记,,,
00:17:36.630,00:17:38.220,本宫也会牢牢记住,00:17:33.980,00:17:38.400,"This is not only a lesson for you, sir;
it is now in my memory as well."
00:17:38.800,00:17:39.420,是,00:17:38.980,00:17:39.713,Yes.
00:17:41.260,00:17:42.340,那槿汐那边,00:17:41.440,00:17:42.520,So Jinxi...?
00:17:43.100,00:17:43.840,你放心,00:17:43.280,00:17:44.322,You can rest assured.
00:17:44.390,00:17:45.630,有娘娘这么一句话,,,
00:17:45.940,00:17:47.350,奴才没有什么不放心的,00:17:44.570,00:17:47.520,"I absolutely can, having heard Your Highness say so."
00:17:47.940,00:17:48.970,奴才先告辞了,00:17:48.120,00:17:49.225,Allow me to take my leave.
00:17:49.520,00:17:50.140,好,00:17:49.700,00:17:50.433,Certainly.
00:17:59.870,00:18:00.820,使不得使不得,00:18:00.050,00:18:01.300,"No, you shouldn't have."
00:18:01.120,00:18:02.480,我自个儿来 自个儿来,00:18:01.300,00:18:02.660,Let me do it myself. Let me do it.
00:18:02.740,00:18:03.530,坐吧,00:18:02.920,00:18:03.710,Just sit.
00:18:06.410,00:18:07.700,衣裳磨破了都不知道,00:18:06.590,00:18:08.408,You don't see your clothes have worn out.
00:18:08.750,00:18:10.790,到了御前不怕被皇上训斥啊,00:18:08.930,00:18:10.970,Aren't you afraid of being scolded by His Majesty?
00:18:13.380,00:18:14.710,知道你会的多,00:18:13.560,00:18:15.041,"I know you're versatile,"
00:18:15.420,00:18:18.170,只是也保不齐样样都忙得过来啊,00:18:15.575,00:18:18.854,but ...you can't attend to everything.
00:18:21.390,00:18:22.050,你还好吗,00:18:21.570,00:18:22.230,Are you all right?
00:18:22.680,00:18:25.050,好啊 我好得很,00:18:22.860,00:18:25.230,I'm good; I'm really good.
00:18:27.230,00:18:29.970,别人越说我不好我越要过得好,00:18:27.410,00:18:30.150,"The more miserable they think I am,
the more committed I am to living well."
00:18:30.900,00:18:32.180,日子是活给自己的,00:18:31.080,00:18:32.360,I live for myself.
00:18:33.230,00:18:34.690,难不成我一脖子吊死,00:18:33.410,00:18:36.280,Am I going to hang myself to fulfill their wish?
00:18:34.980,00:18:36.100,倒遂了他们的心愿,,,
00:18:37.700,00:18:38.610,是这个理,00:18:37.880,00:18:38.880,You are right.
00:18:41.320,00:18:42.360,不过我也知道,00:18:41.500,00:18:42.691,"However, I know"
00:18:43.280,00:18:45.650,你当初是为了熹妃娘娘的事,00:18:43.460,00:18:45.830,you came to me back then
00:18:46.160,00:18:47.450,不得已才来找我的,00:18:46.340,00:18:47.932,because you had to help Consort Lumière.
00:18:49.290,00:18:51.120,你若不是心甘情愿的话,00:18:49.470,00:18:51.300,"If your heart hasn't been committed,"
00:18:52.040,00:18:53.780,外头流言传得这么难听,00:18:52.220,00:18:53.960,"the rumors now must be hard to bear,"
00:18:54.460,00:18:56.330,不如咱们断了不要勉强,00:18:54.640,00:18:56.920,"we can end this now,
so you don't need to put up with all this."
00:18:57.050,00:18:57.830,说什么呢,00:18:57.230,00:18:58.576,What are you talking about?
00:18:59.010,00:19:01.370,我们在一起不就是为了做个伴吗,00:18:59.190,00:19:01.550,We are together because we need a partner in our lives.
00:19:05.260,00:19:06.750,除了熹妃娘娘,00:19:05.440,00:19:06.930,"Besides Consort Lumière,"
00:19:07.520,00:19:10.600,和我相关的就只有你一个了,00:19:07.700,00:19:10.780,you are the only person connected to me.
00:19:12.860,00:19:15.190,在慎刑司那两天我也算想明白了,00:19:13.040,00:19:15.370,"During my days in the Department of Penalty, I also realized"
00:19:16.230,00:19:17.390,为了流言纷扰,,,
00:19:17.740,00:19:19.350,而伤害一个真正爱护自己的人,00:19:16.410,00:19:19.505,it would be the most foolish and unworthy thing to do -
00:19:20.150,00:19:21.940,才是最大的愚蠢和不值,00:19:20.330,00:19:22.643,"to hurt a person who truly cares about me -
over a few rumors."

00:19:41.180,00:19:42.760,今天是小主的好日子,00:19:41.360,00:19:43.240,"It's a big day for you, My Lady."
00:19:43.140,00:19:44.590,不如穿件红色的喜气,00:19:43.320,00:19:44.960,Why not wear something red to look festive?
00:19:45.510,00:19:47.750,像乡下媒婆涂红脸的腮帮子,00:19:45.690,00:19:48.119,It looks like the red cheeks of a country matchmaker.
00:19:48.560,00:19:50.050,去给我换一件绿颜色的来,00:19:48.740,00:19:50.230,Bring me something green.
00:19:51.270,00:19:52.800,小主天天不是穿绿色的,00:19:51.450,00:19:52.980,"My Lady, you wear green"
00:19:53.100,00:19:53.890,就是青色的,00:19:53.280,00:19:54.070,or light blue every day.
00:19:54.560,00:19:55.720,今儿换件颜色吧,00:19:54.740,00:19:56.126,Why don't you wear a different color today?
00:19:56.480,00:19:57.850,我说绿的就是绿的,00:19:56.660,00:19:58.332,"I said green, and I mean green."
00:19:58.940,00:19:59.730,要喜庆些,00:19:59.120,00:20:00.170,"If you insist on being festive,"
00:19:59.990,00:20:02.100,就给我换那个绿色绣合欢花的吧,00:20:00.170,00:20:02.630,"then bring me that dress with the ""coupling joy"" flowers embroidered."
00:20:02.450,00:20:03.110,是,00:20:02.630,00:20:03.290,Yes.
00:20:11.120,00:20:11.780,小主,00:20:11.300,00:20:11.960,My Lady.
00:20:17.750,00:20:18.710,挺好看的,00:20:17.930,00:20:18.890,You look good.
00:20:19.960,00:20:22.710,晚上重华宫中秋夜宴你陪我去,00:20:20.140,00:20:22.890,"You will accompany me to the Mid-Autumn banquet
at the Palace of Layered Brilliance."
00:20:24.390,00:20:27.420,奴婢这样打扮只是不想太丑,00:20:24.570,00:20:27.600,I just don't want to look too ugly.
00:20:28.060,00:20:29.760,并没有抢小主风头的意思,00:20:28.240,00:20:30.000,I have no intention of stealing the glory from Your Highness.
00:20:30.020,00:20:32.010,能在打扮得好看的年纪好好打扮,00:20:30.200,00:20:32.700,You're at an age when you should dress up to look good.
00:20:32.520,00:20:33.430,这不是很好吗,00:20:32.700,00:20:34.269,There is nothing wrong with that.
00:20:35.270,00:20:37.140,奴婢并不是要打扮给王爷看的,00:20:35.450,00:20:37.395,I'm not dressing up for His Lordship.
00:20:37.820,00:20:40.480,要是小主打扮起来会更加好看,00:20:38.000,00:20:41.280,"My Lady, you could look even more beautiful
if you want to make an effort."
00:20:44.030,00:20:45.740,我在他面前只有惭愧,00:20:44.210,00:20:45.920,I only feel ashamed in front of him.
00:20:46.620,00:20:47.650,若有什么风头,00:20:46.800,00:20:47.830,"If I were to dress up,"
00:20:48.450,00:20:49.740,也只有在皇上面前,00:20:48.630,00:20:49.920,it would be only for His Majesty.
00:21:00.340,00:21:02.620,皇上驾到,00:21:00.520,00:21:02.800,His Majesty the Emperor!
00:21:07.260,00:21:08.800,皇上万福金安,00:21:07.440,00:21:08.980,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:21:09.680,00:21:10.290,都坐,00:21:09.860,00:21:10.810,All sit.
00:21:12.680,00:21:13.300,坐下,00:21:12.860,00:21:13.480,Take your seat.
00:21:18.730,00:21:21.270,手这样凉 可是着了风寒了,00:21:18.910,00:21:21.450,"Your hands are freezing, did you catch a cold?"
00:21:21.980,00:21:23.770,最近夜里是觉得风凉了,00:21:22.160,00:21:24.160,"Recently, it has been windy and cold at night."
00:21:32.500,00:21:33.410,老十七,00:21:32.680,00:21:33.590,Where is Yunli?
00:21:34.540,00:21:35.990,臣弟来晚了,00:21:34.720,00:21:36.170,"I'm late, Your Majesty."
00:21:38.380,00:21:39.460,还请皇兄恕罪,00:21:38.560,00:21:40.189,I beg Your Majesty’s pardon for my delay.
00:21:40.750,00:21:43.960,朕早就习惯你在宴席上迟到早退,00:21:40.930,00:21:44.140,I'm already used to your late arrivals and early departures.
00:21:45.510,00:21:47.460,当初你执意要去盛京,00:21:45.690,00:21:47.640,You insisted on going to Shengjing back then.
00:21:48.720,00:21:50.550,如今人都添了几分憔悴,00:21:48.900,00:21:50.730,You look a little haggard right now.
00:21:51.390,00:21:53.420,到了盛京不幸染了风寒,00:21:51.570,00:21:53.600,"Unfortunately, I caught a cold when I arrived in Shengjing."
00:21:53.850,00:21:54.510,病了十几日,00:21:54.030,00:21:55.030,I was sick for over ten days.
00:21:55.060,00:21:56.340,倒不是什么风尘之故,00:21:55.240,00:21:56.520,It was not due to traveling.
00:21:56.640,00:21:58.130,怎么没有人来报知朕,00:21:56.820,00:21:58.310,Why did no one tell me you were sick?
00:21:58.560,00:22:00.470,身边跟着的人都是做什么的,00:21:58.740,00:22:00.650,What exactly were those servants doing?
00:22:00.820,00:22:01.930,是臣弟不让他们说的,00:22:01.000,00:22:02.299,I didn't let them say anything.
00:22:02.940,00:22:05.020,都是小病而已如今都好了,00:22:03.120,00:22:05.200,"It was just an insignificant ailment.
I'm fully recovered now."
00:22:06.530,00:22:08.990,你是缺个照顾你起居的人了,00:22:06.710,00:22:09.170,You need a person who can take care of you in your everyday life.
00:22:09.490,00:22:11.320,如今可有中意的人吗,00:22:09.670,00:22:11.500,Do you have anyone in mind right now?
00:22:12.280,00:22:13.490,如果有中意的人的话,00:22:12.460,00:22:13.670,I wouldn't be coming alone
00:22:14.290,00:22:15.700,臣弟也不会只身前来了,00:22:14.470,00:22:15.880,if I had one.
00:22:16.790,00:22:18.400,也许臣弟毕生所求都只是,00:22:16.970,00:22:18.580,Maybe all I want in my life is
00:22:19.170,00:22:20.200,庄生晓梦罢了,00:22:19.350,00:22:20.825,"""Zhuangzi's dream to become a butterfly."""
00:22:25.050,00:22:27.460,其实允禧啊也长大很多了,00:22:25.230,00:22:27.640,"Speaking of which, Yunxi is of age as well."
00:22:27.800,00:22:30.170,也该找个福晋好好静静心了,00:22:27.980,00:22:30.350,It is also time to search for a wife and settle down.
00:22:31.100,00:22:31.880,皇嫂笑话,00:22:31.280,00:22:32.372,"Please don't tease me, imperial sister-in-law."
00:22:32.640,00:22:34.250,臣弟和十七哥心思一样,00:22:32.820,00:22:34.430,I share my 17th brother's desire
00:22:34.970,00:22:36.640,必要求一位心爱之人才好,00:22:35.150,00:22:36.933,that I have to find someone that I love.
00:22:38.190,00:22:40.600,你看大的不好教坏小的,00:22:38.370,00:22:40.780,"Look, the older one doesn't set a good example."
00:22:41.400,00:22:43.060,允禧都不敢娶妻了,00:22:41.580,00:22:43.240,Now Yunxi doesn't want to marry.
00:22:44.400,00:22:47.190,大清只要有皇兄枝繁叶茂就好,00:22:44.580,00:22:47.593,"The Great Qing needs only our imperial brother
to ""spread out the branches"" for our family."
00:22:48.070,00:22:50.900,臣弟们也好偷偷闲了,00:22:48.250,00:22:51.080,So we have more time doing nothing.
00:22:59.420,00:23:00.330,惠嫔娘娘安好,00:22:59.600,00:23:00.812,Peace to Concubine Vertu.
00:23:00.960,00:23:02.320,还未向惠嫔娘娘道喜,00:23:01.140,00:23:02.689,I haven't said congratulations to Your Highness.
00:23:03.290,00:23:04.330,多谢王爷,00:23:03.470,00:23:04.510,I thank Your Lordship.
00:23:10.930,00:23:12.460,熹妃娘娘安好,00:23:11.110,00:23:12.640,Peace to Consort Lumière.
00:23:19.310,00:23:20.220,王爷同安,00:23:19.490,00:23:20.702,The same to you Your Lordship.
00:23:21.560,00:23:24.020,娘娘即将临盆 身体可还康泰,00:23:21.740,00:23:24.200,"Your Highness's due date is near.
How's your health?"
00:23:24.940,00:23:26.900,劳王爷挂心一切都好,00:23:25.120,00:23:27.080,"I thank Your Lordship for caring.
Everything is going well."
00:23:35.120,00:23:37.650,皇上 小主该去喝安胎药了,00:23:35.300,00:23:37.830,"Your Majesty, it's time for My Lady to take her prenatal tonic."
00:23:38.330,00:23:39.030,你赶紧去,00:23:38.510,00:23:39.550,Go quickly.
00:23:39.910,00:23:40.990,臣妾去去就来,00:23:40.090,00:23:41.359,"I'll be back soon, Your Majesty."
00:23:53.760,00:23:58.720,但愿人长久 千里共婵娟,00:23:53.797,00:23:59.169,"""I pray our life be long;
A thousand miles apart, we can still share the beauty of the full moon."""

00:24:05.560,00:24:06.550,小主还好吧,00:24:05.740,00:24:06.730,"My Lady, are you all right?"
00:24:07.730,00:24:08.770,总以为能忍住,00:24:07.910,00:24:08.950,I thought I could hold it in.
00:24:10.150,00:24:11.230,总以为能忘了他,00:24:10.330,00:24:11.410,I thought I could forget about him.
00:24:11.740,00:24:12.850,险些失了分寸,00:24:11.920,00:24:13.294,I almost couldn't behave properly.
00:24:14.160,00:24:15.610,小主和王爷心里的苦,00:24:14.340,00:24:15.790,I fully understand the bitterness in the hearts of
00:24:16.030,00:24:18.270,奴婢如何不明白只是,00:24:16.210,00:24:18.450,"His Lordship and you, My lady. It's just..."
00:24:18.580,00:24:19.610,他要好好活着,00:24:18.760,00:24:20.000,He must live a good life.
00:24:23.830,00:24:25.040,小主心绪不好,00:24:24.010,00:24:25.220,Your emotions are disturbed.
00:24:25.380,00:24:26.710,我们还是缓一缓再回去吧,00:24:25.560,00:24:26.890,Let's take time to soothe your feelings.
00:24:27.460,00:24:28.540,奴婢陪您去走一走,00:24:27.640,00:24:28.871,I will accompany you for a walk.
00:24:47.400,00:24:48.060,你还好吗,00:24:47.580,00:24:48.580,How have you been?
00:24:49.820,00:24:51.400,方才席间已经说过了,00:24:50.000,00:24:51.580,I already said earlier at the banquet
00:24:52.320,00:24:53.400,本宫一切安好,00:24:52.500,00:24:53.769,that everything is fine.
00:24:54.740,00:24:57.400,方才是方才现在是现在,00:24:54.920,00:24:57.580,That was then. Now is now.
00:24:58.950,00:25:00.160,我在盛京逗留数月,00:24:59.130,00:25:00.529,I stayed in Shengjing for several months.
00:25:01.330,00:25:02.280,如今回京,00:25:01.510,00:25:02.460,"Now I'm back,"
00:25:03.460,00:25:06.950,只想听娘娘真心说自己安好,00:25:03.640,00:25:07.130,"I need to hear Your Highness say you're fine from your heart,"
00:25:07.790,00:25:08.620,才能放心,00:25:07.970,00:25:09.555,so that I can put my mind at ease.
00:25:12.800,00:25:15.130,王爷若关心太多本宫是否安好,00:25:12.980,00:25:15.310,"If Your Lordship cares too much about my well-being,"
00:25:16.430,00:25:18.040,王爷自身就无法安好,00:25:16.610,00:25:18.220,Your Lordship will be ill at ease.
00:25:19.430,00:25:20.840,实在不必劳心过多,00:25:19.610,00:25:21.133,Please don't exert your mind.
00:25:22.180,00:25:23.390,浣碧我们回去吧,00:25:22.360,00:25:23.570,"Jade, let's go back."
00:25:23.730,00:25:24.310,不要走,00:25:23.910,00:25:24.716,Don't leave.
00:25:25.730,00:25:27.840,放手放手,00:25:25.910,00:25:27.266,Let me go.
,,,00:25:27.492,00:25:28.813,Let me go.
00:25:29.940,00:25:30.650,放手,00:25:30.120,00:25:30.830,Let go.
00:25:41.120,00:25:42.820,我总觉得你的日子过得不舒心,00:25:41.300,00:25:43.151,"I always think you're not truly happy,"
00:25:44.370,00:25:47.830,即便听闻永寿宫焕然如金屋,00:25:43.618,00:25:49.520,"even with the Palace of Eternal Longevity
being as opulent as a golden house."
00:25:50.340,00:25:52.080,无论住的是金屋还是茅屋,00:25:50.520,00:25:52.260,"Whether it's house made of gold or of hay,"
00:25:53.300,00:25:54.500,都是本宫自愿的,00:25:53.480,00:25:54.982,I chose to live in it myself.
00:25:56.680,00:25:58.170,能不能舒心且看自己,00:25:56.860,00:25:59.180,"Whether one can live comfortably depends entirely on oneself,"
00:25:59.180,00:25:59.960,无关他人,00:25:59.360,00:26:00.140,and not anyone else.
00:26:01.310,00:26:02.340,即便是富贵人,00:26:01.490,00:26:02.633,"Even Noble Lady Paix,"
00:26:04.640,00:26:05.970,当日虽然身份卑微,00:26:04.820,00:26:06.339,"despite her humble status back then,"
00:26:06.850,00:26:08.510,可也比如今自由自在多了,00:26:07.030,00:26:08.690,was much more free.
00:26:09.440,00:26:10.180,何况是你,00:26:09.620,00:26:11.040,Isn't it even more true for you...
00:26:10.860,00:26:11.690,你又不是她,00:26:11.040,00:26:12.059,You're not her.
00:26:13.320,00:26:14.850,又怎知她不是自得其乐,00:26:13.500,00:26:15.181,How do you know whether she's happy?
00:26:15.190,00:26:15.730,是否真心快乐,00:26:15.370,00:26:16.250,It's not only the person themselves
00:26:16.070,00:26:16.980,未必只有自己知道,00:26:16.250,00:26:17.349,that can tell if they're happy.
00:26:19.570,00:26:22.740,月有阴晴圆缺何况人生百变呢,00:26:19.750,00:26:22.920,"The moon waxes and wanes, and so does life."
00:26:24.370,00:26:25.030,王爷,00:26:24.550,00:26:25.210,"Your Lordship,"
00:26:26.540,00:26:28.750,不要再为不值得伤心的人伤心了,00:26:26.720,00:26:28.930,please don't be sad about people who are not worthy.
,,,00:26:33.140,00:26:34.160,If we...
00:26:32.960,00:26:36.920,做人如果不能由着自己的心的话,00:26:35.179,00:26:37.440,"cannot live our life following our hearts,"
00:26:38.510,00:26:39.460,还不如明月,00:26:38.690,00:26:40.151,we are more pathetic than the moon.
00:26:41.180,00:26:44.890,到了十五总还能圆一回,00:26:41.360,00:26:45.070,At least the moon reaches fullness every fifteenth.
00:26:45.850,00:26:48.060,所以来世我不会再选择那么艰苦,00:26:46.030,00:26:48.240,So I won't choose this hardship in the next life.
00:26:52.860,00:26:54.560,王爷与本宫再耽搁下去,00:26:53.040,00:26:54.740,"If Your Lordship and I delay any longer,"
00:26:55.360,00:26:56.640,只怕要惊动皇上了,00:26:55.540,00:26:56.971,His Majesty will be alerted.
00:27:08.330,00:27:09.410,你也好生珍重,00:27:08.510,00:27:09.590,Please take good care of yourself.
00:27:12.960,00:27:13.570,你也是,00:27:13.140,00:27:13.901,You too.
00:27:16.630,00:27:18.790,为了避嫌还是我先回去,00:27:16.810,00:27:18.970,"To avoid suspicion, I'll go back first."
00:27:19.420,00:27:20.910,过了片刻你再入席就是了,00:27:19.600,00:27:21.090,You can go in a while later.

00:34:12.590,00:34:14.370,皇上孩子太小,00:34:12.770,00:34:14.550,"Your Majesty, the babies are too little."
00:34:14.760,00:34:16.460,先让乳娘抱回去吧,00:34:14.940,00:34:16.640,Let's have the nursemaids take them back.
00:34:17.470,00:34:18.500,快快快 快去,00:34:17.650,00:34:18.718,"Yes, yes, go ahead."
00:34:18.760,00:34:19.800,奴婢已经看过了,,,
00:34:20.260,00:34:22.050,也好回去向太后复命,00:34:18.940,00:34:22.200,"Now I've seen the twins, I can report back to Her Majesty."
00:34:22.720,00:34:23.340,好,00:34:22.900,00:34:23.820,Very well.
00:34:23.640,00:34:24.600,奴婢告辞了,00:34:23.820,00:34:24.969,I shall take my leave.
00:34:24.980,00:34:25.630,去吧,00:34:25.160,00:34:25.810,Yes.
00:34:30.150,00:34:33.730,嬛嬛你知道朕有多高兴吗,00:34:30.330,00:34:33.910,"Huan Huan, do you know how happy I am?"
00:34:34.820,00:34:36.930,你一下子给朕生了两个孩子,00:34:35.000,00:34:38.800,You gave birth to two children at once. It is a huge contribution.
00:34:37.450,00:34:38.650,立了这么大的功劳,,,
00:34:39.360,00:34:40.900,朕要封你为贵妃,00:34:39.540,00:34:41.231,I will promote you to Noble Consort.
00:34:42.160,00:34:44.820,要让你做朕最钟爱的贵妃,00:34:42.340,00:34:45.000,You will be my beloved Noble Consort.
00:34:45.660,00:34:47.700,皇上若要给臣妾贵妃的名位,00:34:45.840,00:34:49.960,"Your Majesty, I do not deserve the title of Noble Consort."
00:34:48.330,00:34:49.790,臣妾实实不敢承受,,,
00:34:50.540,00:34:52.500,除了你在朕的心中,,,
00:34:53.040,00:34:55.290,没有人能担得起贵妃的名位,00:34:50.720,00:34:55.440,"Besides you, no one else deserves this title in my mind."
00:34:57.170,00:34:59.510,好好的怎么打冷战了可是冷了,00:34:57.350,00:34:59.690,You just shuddered. Do you feel cold?
00:35:00.800,00:35:03.210,斐雯娘娘刚生完怎么可以开窗,00:35:00.980,00:35:03.390,"Petunia, why did you leave the door open?"
00:35:03.510,00:35:04.840,万一冻着怎么办快关上,00:35:03.690,00:35:05.510,Her Highness could catch a cold. Close it immediately!
00:35:06.350,00:35:07.090,回皇上的话,00:35:06.530,00:35:07.270,"Your Majesty,"
00:35:07.730,00:35:09.930,方才接生嬷嬷说殿里血腥气重,00:35:07.910,00:35:11.440,"the birthing madam said that there was a strong smell
of blood in the hall, and told me to keep the door open."
00:35:10.310,00:35:11.270,才叫把门开着的,,,
00:35:11.610,00:35:12.590,所以奴婢没有关,00:35:11.790,00:35:12.845,So I didn't close it.
00:35:12.860,00:35:14.220,冻着了娘娘还顶嘴,00:35:13.040,00:35:14.400,You make excuses for exposing Her Highness to cold?
00:35:14.650,00:35:15.480,出去掌嘴二十,00:35:14.640,00:35:15.660,Slap her twenty times outside.
00:35:15.980,00:35:16.640,嗻,00:35:16.160,00:35:16.820,Yes.
00:35:18.900,00:35:19.520,苏培盛,00:35:19.080,00:35:19.920,Su Peisheng.
00:35:19.740,00:35:20.350,奴才在,00:35:19.920,00:35:20.530,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:35:20.660,00:35:21.390,传旨六宫,00:35:20.840,00:35:21.910,Deliver my decree to the whole harem:
00:35:22.660,00:35:26.120,永寿宫熹妃晋熹贵妃,00:35:22.840,00:35:26.300,"Consort Lumière of the Palace of Eternal Longevity
is promoted to Noble Consort Lumière."
00:35:27.120,00:35:30.110,于皇子满月之日同册嘉礼,00:35:27.300,00:35:30.290,The formal ceremony will be held on the day when the twins turn one month old.
00:35:30.960,00:35:35.170,熹贵妃出月后赐协理六宫之权,00:35:31.140,00:35:35.350,"Noble Consort Lumière will be entrusted with the authority
to assist in palace affairs after sitting the month."
00:35:35.880,00:35:36.540,遵旨,00:35:36.060,00:35:37.022,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:35:38.760,00:35:40.620,嬛嬛你可喜欢吗,00:35:38.940,00:35:40.800,"Huan Huan, do you like it?"
00:35:41.260,00:35:44.090,皇上赏赐 臣妾自然喜不自胜,00:35:41.440,00:35:44.270,I rejoice at Your Majesty's reward.
00:35:45.890,00:35:46.840,皇上在里头听着呢,00:35:46.070,00:35:47.209,His Majesty is listening inside.
00:35:47.470,00:35:48.380,你自个儿掌嘴吧,00:35:47.650,00:35:48.560,I'll let you slap yourself.
00:35:48.680,00:35:49.420,我下手没轻重的,00:35:48.860,00:35:49.950,My hand might be too heavy.
00:35:49.770,00:35:50.850,允公公听见的,,,
00:35:51.100,00:35:53.140,这件事情真的不关奴婢的事,00:35:49.950,00:35:53.320,"Mr. Yun, you heard that it was not my fault."
00:35:53.810,00:35:55.850,奴婢只是照盼咐做事,00:35:53.990,00:35:56.030,I was just following the instructions.
00:35:56.780,00:35:58.520,皇上爱惜娘娘一时拿你撒气,00:35:56.960,00:35:58.700,His Majesty took it out on you because he cherishes Her Highness.
00:35:59.110,00:35:59.850,另lJ往心里去啊,00:35:59.290,00:36:00.370,Don't hold any grudge.
00:36:00.740,00:36:01.850,皇上爱惜娘娘,,,
00:36:02.450,00:36:04.810,就要拿咱们做奴才的撒气吗,00:36:00.920,00:36:04.960,"Why does His Majesty take it out on us servants
just because he cherishes Her Highness?"
00:36:05.080,00:36:05.940,说话别失了分寸,00:36:05.260,00:36:06.158,Mind your tongue!
00:36:06.490,00:36:07.950,让皇上听见可就不止掌嘴了,00:36:06.670,00:36:08.400,It won't just be slapping yourself if His Majesty hears that.
00:36:16.460,00:36:19.370,娘娘 奴才斗胆向娘娘讨个赏,00:36:16.640,00:36:19.550,"Your Highness, I boldly request a reward."
00:36:20.010,00:36:21.710,娘娘这般的恩福双全,00:36:20.000,00:36:22.116,Your Highness is favored by His Majesty and blessed by Heaven.
00:36:22.130,00:36:23.340,随便赏奴才个什么,,,
00:36:23.800,00:36:25.510,也好让奴才沾点喜气啊,00:36:22.310,00:36:25.680,Any reward from Your Highness will bring me good luck.
00:36:27.060,00:36:28.890,要赏就赏个大恩典,00:36:27.240,00:36:29.070,You deserve a big reward.
00:36:29.470,00:36:31.310,还得皇上来给才体面呀,00:36:29.650,00:36:31.640,It would be more appropriate if it's from His Majesty.
00:36:34.810,00:36:37.560,从前你们俩受了极大的委屈,00:36:34.990,00:36:37.740,You two endured great hardship in the past.
00:36:38.730,00:36:41.070,既然今天贵妃开口了,00:36:38.910,00:36:41.250,"Since the Noble Consort requested,"
00:36:41.950,00:36:45.150,朕就把槿汐正式赐给你做妻子,00:36:42.130,00:36:45.330,I'll grant Jinxi to be your official wife.
00:36:45.660,00:36:46.990,你可要好好待人家,00:36:45.840,00:36:47.170,Treat her well.
00:36:48.120,00:36:49.110,好,00:36:48.300,00:36:49.290,Yes!
00:36:49.410,00:36:49.900,谢皇上,00:36:49.590,00:36:50.090,I thank Your Majesty.
00:36:50.250,00:36:51.530,多谢皇上 娘娘厚爱,00:36:50.430,00:36:52.140,I thank Your Majesty and Your Highness for the good graces.
00:36:52.160,00:36:52.870,奴才一定,00:36:52.340,00:36:53.050,"I will,"
00:36:53.370,00:36:55.110,奴才一定对槿汐好,00:36:53.550,00:36:55.290,I... I will treat Jinxi well!
00:36:56.130,00:36:57.040,还杵着做什么,00:36:56.310,00:36:57.220,What are you all waiting for?
00:36:57.340,00:36:58.320,多谢皇上 多谢娘娘,,,
00:36:58.670,00:36:59.530,赶紧问他们要酒喝去,00:36:57.520,00:36:59.821,"- I thank Your Majesty and Your Highness!
- Go ask for drinks from them."
00:36:59.800,00:37:00.460,娘娘,00:36:59.980,00:37:00.640,Your Highness!
00:37:06.340,00:37:07.500,你先好好歇息,00:37:06.520,00:37:07.680,Have a good rest.
00:37:08.100,00:37:10.010,朕晚上再来看你,00:37:08.280,00:37:10.190,I'll come back to see you tonight.
00:37:11.560,00:37:12.890,臣妾恭送皇上,00:37:11.740,00:37:13.070,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:37:23.240,00:37:24.570,恭送皇上,00:37:23.420,00:37:24.825,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:37:35.290,00:37:36.660,方才敬妃娘娘过来看过,00:37:35.470,00:37:37.066,Consort Estime was here earlier.
00:37:37.080,00:37:38.160,小主可要见一见,00:37:37.260,00:37:38.453,"Will you see her, My Lady?"
00:37:39.710,00:37:41.040,眼下我也乏了,00:37:39.890,00:37:41.220,I feel tired now.
00:37:42.050,00:37:44.540,你去回敬妃的话谢她的盛情,,,
00:37:45.380,00:37:46.250,待我好些,00:37:42.230,00:37:48.400,"Thank Consort Estime for me, and tell her
that I will invite her over after I recover."
00:37:46.890,00:37:48.250,再亲自请她来小聚,,,
00:37:52.560,00:37:53.760,按我的话去回吧,00:37:52.740,00:37:54.656,Reply to her with what I said.
00:37:54.810,00:37:56.770,眼下谁来我都不见,00:37:54.990,00:37:56.950,I won't see any visitors for now.
00:37:58.900,00:37:59.510,是,00:37:59.080,00:37:59.690,Yes.
00:38:03.070,00:38:05.560,一个小公主 一个小阿哥,00:38:03.250,00:38:07.000,The little princess and the little prince are identically adorable.
00:38:05.860,00:38:06.820,一样的可爱,,,
00:38:07.570,00:38:10.280,太后高兴得都看不过来了,00:38:07.750,00:38:10.460,Your Majesty is too joyful to take your eyes off the babies.
00:38:10.950,00:38:12.030,这样的喜事,00:38:11.130,00:38:12.510,What a joyous occasion!
00:38:12.330,00:38:14.910,就算眼睛看花了也是高兴,00:38:12.510,00:38:15.090,I would keep looking at them until my eyes get sore.
00:38:16.500,00:38:19.660,抱远一点 别沾了哀家的病气,00:38:16.680,00:38:19.840,"Keep them farther from me, so that I won't pass my weak qi to them."
00:38:20.210,00:38:22.170,熹贵妃的龙凤胎是早产的,00:38:20.390,00:38:22.350,Noble Consort Lumière's twins were born prematurely.
00:38:22.630,00:38:24.090,你们要好生照看着,00:38:22.810,00:38:24.270,You must take good care of them.
00:38:24.460,00:38:25.700,不许有一点闪失,00:38:24.640,00:38:26.069,No mistake will be pardoned.
00:38:26.220,00:38:26.920,是,00:38:26.400,00:38:27.100,Yes.
00:38:28.010,00:38:29.470,名字都取好了吗,00:38:28.190,00:38:29.650,Have you decided on their names?
00:38:30.010,00:38:31.750,六阿哥叫弘瞻,00:38:30.190,00:38:31.930,The Sixth Prince is named Hongyan.
00:38:33.810,00:38:35.220,让我看看六阿哥,00:38:33.990,00:38:35.400,Let me look at the Sixth Prince.
00:38:39.810,00:38:40.680,好孩子,00:38:39.990,00:38:40.860,Good boy.
00:38:42.860,00:38:44.060,白白嫩嫩的,00:38:43.040,00:38:44.693,"Unlike you, he has fair and tender skin."
00:38:44.900,00:38:47.640,不像皇帝生下来黑黯黯的,00:38:45.080,00:38:47.820,You had dark skin when you were born.
00:38:49.240,00:38:50.320,熹贵妃白,,,
00:38:50.570,00:38:52.610,所以生下来的孩子自然白嫩,00:38:49.420,00:38:52.760,"Noble Consort Lumière has fair skin, and so do the twins."
00:38:53.330,00:38:54.860,公主还没有定封号,00:38:53.510,00:38:55.266,The princess's honorary name hasn't been determined yet.
00:38:55.750,00:38:57.780,让熹贵妃自己去想吧,00:38:55.930,00:38:57.960,I'll leave that up to Noble Consort Lumière.
00:38:58.080,00:39:00.820,也好阿哥的名字你定,00:38:58.260,00:39:02.800,Good. You name the prince and she names the princess.
00:39:01.170,00:39:02.620,公主的名字她定,,,
00:39:03.500,00:39:05.490,就等惠嫔的孩子生下来,00:39:03.680,00:39:07.720,I will name the child of Concubine Vertu once it's born.
00:39:06.210,00:39:07.550,名字哀家来取,,,
00:39:16.430,00:39:17.840,如今双生子落地,,,
00:39:18.230,00:39:20.390,臣妾的清白也可分明了,00:39:16.610,00:39:20.560,"Now that the twins have ""landed on the ground"",
I can finally be vindicated from the rumor."
00:39:21.690,00:39:23.470,外头再有什么流言辈语,00:39:21.870,00:39:25.200,I will impose stern punishment on whoever spreads any rumors.
00:39:23.820,00:39:25.020,朕定严惩不贷,,,
00:39:27.440,00:39:29.180,臣妾能再陪伴四郎左右,,,
00:39:29.530,00:39:31.610,诞下孩儿已是上天庇佑,00:39:27.620,00:39:31.760,"I'm blessed by Heaven to come back to Si Lang's side
and give birth to our children."
00:39:32.200,00:39:33.560,臣妾没什么可抱怨的,00:39:32.380,00:39:33.740,There's nothing for me to complain about.
00:39:33.870,00:39:35.110,你是谨言慎行,,,
00:39:35.790,00:39:37.950,别人却怀疑你腹中的孩儿,00:39:34.050,00:39:38.120,"While you were cautious of your words and actions,
others suspected the children in your belly."
00:39:39.500,00:39:42.990,终究朕是要理一理后宫的舌头,00:39:39.680,00:39:43.170,"I must ""straighten the tongues"" in the harem."
00:39:44.170,00:39:45.410,后宫的事再大,,,
00:39:45.840,00:39:47.450,也不过是女人之间的事情,00:39:44.350,00:39:47.600,Harem affairs are just the concerns of women.
00:39:48.130,00:39:49.540,自有皇后娘娘做主,00:39:48.310,00:39:49.720,Her Majesty will exercise good judgment.
00:39:50.380,00:39:52.470,皇上又何必要镗这趟浑水,00:39:50.560,00:39:52.650,Why would Your Majesty wade into the muddy water?
00:39:52.930,00:39:55.040,反叫人落了偏心臣妾的口实,00:39:53.110,00:39:55.409,Others might affirm their belief that Your Majesty is partial towards me.
00:39:55.560,00:39:57.010,朕就是要她们晓得,,,
00:39:57.430,00:39:58.840,朕最疼的是你,00:39:55.740,00:39:59.000,I am showing my partiality towards you to the whole harem.
00:39:59.600,00:40:02.560,这样她们就不敢再轻视你半分,00:39:59.780,00:40:02.740,Then they will never dare to slight you at all.
00:40:03.480,00:40:06.770,皇后从前也是担得起贤德二字的,00:40:03.660,00:40:06.950,The Empress used to uphold a virtuous name.
00:40:07.860,00:40:09.650,如今也是耳根子软了,00:40:08.040,00:40:10.164,"But now her ""ears have grown soft"","
00:40:10.650,00:40:13.400,不知是否是岁数大了的缘故,00:40:10.806,00:40:13.560,which might be due to her age.
00:40:14.820,00:40:18.440,至近至远东西 至深至浅清溪,00:40:15.000,00:40:18.620,"""East and West are the nearest and the furthest apart;
A clear stream can be deep but look shallow."""
00:40:19.580,00:40:23.040,至高至明日月 至亲至疏夫妻,00:40:19.760,00:40:23.220,"""The sun and the moon are the highest and brightest;
Husband and wife can be closest and most distant."""
00:40:24.380,00:40:26.330,只要四郎时刻相信嬛嬛,00:40:24.560,00:40:26.510,"As long as Si Lang has faith in me,"
00:40:26.790,00:40:29.040,那咱们就是至亲夫妻了,00:40:26.970,00:40:29.220,"we will be ""the closest husband and wife""."
00:40:30.210,00:40:32.250,皇后娘娘驾到,00:40:30.390,00:40:32.430,Her Majesty the Empress!
00:40:42.640,00:40:43.720,参见皇上,00:40:42.820,00:40:43.900,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:40:44.600,00:40:45.180,坐吧,00:40:44.780,00:40:45.586,Have a seat.
00:40:45.860,00:40:46.510,是,00:40:46.040,00:40:46.690,Yes.
00:40:47.320,00:40:49.480,嫔妾失礼 还请娘娘恕罪,00:40:47.500,00:40:49.660,I hope Your Majesty forgives my bad manners.
00:40:50.940,00:40:52.100,你躺着就好了,00:40:51.120,00:40:52.280,Just stay there.
00:40:52.570,00:40:53.530,你现在可是,,,
00:40:53.820,00:40:55.610,我们大清的有功之人哪,00:40:52.750,00:40:55.760,You have borne a great accomplishment for the entire nation.
00:40:56.120,00:40:57.530,多谢皇后娘娘关怀,00:40:56.300,00:40:57.710,I thank Your Majesty.
00:40:59.620,00:41:02.240,熹贵妃诞下这两个婴孩之后,,,
00:41:02.750,00:41:05.200,臣妾也没有旁的东西可以赠送,00:40:59.800,00:41:05.400,"Noble Consort Lumière has given birth to two children.
I have no other gifts than these:"
00:41:05.580,00:41:07.160,倒是从前姐姐在时,,,
00:41:07.500,00:41:09.620,有几块上好的羊脂玉给了臣妾,00:41:05.760,00:41:09.800,"My sister gave me several pieces of precious
suet-white jade a long time ago."
00:41:10.380,00:41:12.590,臣妾已叫工匠连夜赶工,00:41:10.560,00:41:12.826,I urged the craftsmen to work hard overnight
00:41:12.840,00:41:14.920,制成了一双玲珑玉璧,00:41:12.826,00:41:17.252,to carve them into a pair of jade bi for the babies as their amulets.
00:41:15.180,00:41:17.260,给两个孩子保平安用,,,
00:41:19.850,00:41:21.960,她的东西自然是极好的,00:41:20.030,00:41:22.140,"Her things are naturally the finest,"
00:41:22.890,00:41:23.970,给孩子用也好,00:41:23.070,00:41:24.376,and suitable for the babies.
00:41:24.690,00:41:25.680,难为你舍得,00:41:24.870,00:41:26.313,I appreciate your generosity.
00:41:26.560,00:41:27.350,姐姐之前,,,
00:41:27.560,00:41:29.770,留给臣妾的念想之物不少,00:41:26.740,00:41:29.920,My sister left me many items to remember her with.
00:41:29.980,00:41:32.100,臣妾都时不时拿出细看一番,00:41:30.160,00:41:34.320,"I take them out and look at them sometimes
to remind myself of the good times we spent together."
00:41:32.490,00:41:34.150,也是姐妹间的情分,,,
00:41:37.030,00:41:37.770,这是自然,00:41:37.210,00:41:38.080,Of course.
00:41:40.540,00:41:43.320,朕有数月不曾去看过皇后了,00:41:40.720,00:41:43.500,I haven't visited you for months.
00:41:46.370,00:41:47.990,臣妾人老色衰了,00:41:46.550,00:41:48.396,I am old and my looks have faded.
00:41:48.460,00:41:50.170,远不及年轻的妃嫔们,00:41:48.640,00:41:51.840,"I can't compare to the young concubines
who are healthy and able to conceive children."
00:41:50.340,00:41:51.670,体健适宜生育,,,
00:41:52.460,00:41:53.330,皇上闲暇时,,,
00:41:53.720,00:41:55.380,多去年轻的妃嫔那儿走走,00:41:52.640,00:41:55.560,"Your Majesty should visit young concubines more when you have time,"
00:41:55.680,00:41:57.130,别总把自己关在养心殿,,,
00:41:57.510,00:41:58.970,看摺子见大臣,00:41:55.860,00:41:59.120,"instead of locking yourself all day
in the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:42:01.970,00:42:03.380,臣妾今早出来时,,,
00:42:03.390,00:42:04.850,在整理姐姐的遗物,00:42:02.150,00:42:07.720,"I was in the middle of sorting my sister's
belongings before I headed here this morning."
00:42:05.100,00:42:07.560,才整理了一半便放在那里,,,
00:42:08.560,00:42:11.600,趁天色还早臣妾先行告退,00:42:08.740,00:42:11.780,I'll take my leave while it's still well lit.
00:42:13.280,00:42:13.810,去吧,00:42:13.460,00:42:14.141,Certainly.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.180,00:42:59.180,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.180,00:43:19.180,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.180,00:43:36.180,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.180,00:43:54.180,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.180,00:44:02.180,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.180,00:44:14.180,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.180,00:44:33.180,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
