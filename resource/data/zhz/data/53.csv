00:02:21.970,00:02:22.710,娘子,00:02:23.100,00:02:23.977,"Mistress,"
00:02:23.180,00:02:26.220,这几日可曾听见温大人的劝说,00:02:24.280,00:02:27.320,have you considered Dr. Wen's suggestion?
00:02:26.980,00:02:27.710,如果跟温大人,,,
00:02:28.020,00:02:29.300,安安稳稳地过一辈子,00:02:27.856,00:02:30.709,It wouldn't be a bad choice to ...
00:02:30.730,00:02:31.840,也是不错的,00:02:31.752,00:02:33.639,live a tranquil life with him.
00:02:32.730,00:02:35.770,槿汐你是最明白我的,00:02:33.830,00:02:35.105,"Jinxi,"
00:02:36.530,00:02:37.640,又何必来试我呢,00:02:35.397,00:02:37.240,you know me the best.
,,,00:02:37.574,00:02:39.479,Why would you test my intentions?
00:02:39.740,00:02:41.570,我是不会和温实初在一起的,00:02:40.605,00:02:42.867,I will not be together with Wen Shichu.
00:02:43.950,00:02:46.440,父亲病重 困住甯古塔,00:02:45.217,00:02:47.612,My father is gravely ill and confined in Ningguta.
00:02:47.790,00:02:49.530,甄氏一族没有人来照顾,00:02:48.862,00:02:51.187,There is no one to take care of the whole Zhen clan.
00:02:51.540,00:02:53.200,从前允礼能为我做的,00:02:52.666,00:02:54.880,What Yunli was able to do for me
00:02:54.340,00:02:56.170,如今都要靠我一人扛起,00:02:55.323,00:02:57.657,is now my responsibility to carry alone.
00:02:58.420,00:02:59.710,温实初帮不了我,00:02:59.296,00:03:01.144,Wen Shichu can't help me.
00:03:01.340,00:03:02.630,我只能靠我自己,00:03:02.216,00:03:04.000,I have only myself to rely upon.
00:03:04.760,00:03:07.800,好娘子既然心意已决,00:03:05.860,00:03:08.831,"Yes, Mistress, since you have made up your mind,"
00:03:08.100,00:03:08.960,就不会是一个人,00:03:08.831,00:03:10.448,you will not be alone.
00:03:09.640,00:03:11.930,奴婢和浣碧都会追随着娘子的,00:03:10.740,00:03:13.030,Jade and I will always follow you.
00:03:13.230,00:03:16.470,只是不知道娘子预备怎么做呢,00:03:14.228,00:03:15.687,But Mistress ...
00:03:17.030,00:03:18.190,允礼死得蹊跷,00:03:15.975,00:03:17.906,What plan do you have in mind?
00:03:19.860,00:03:20.980,我不能不理会,00:03:17.906,00:03:19.520,Yunli's death was suspicious ...
00:03:22.740,00:03:24.700,他去滇藏之前曾和我说过,00:03:20.813,00:03:22.560,and I must not ignore it.
00:03:25.830,00:03:28.070,准葛尔部叛乱至今未平,00:03:23.840,00:03:26.414,He told me before he left for Yunnan and Tibet
00:03:28.450,00:03:30.070,常有细作混入滇藏,00:03:26.930,00:03:31.040,that the rebellious Dzungars often send spies to the area.
00:03:31.750,00:03:34.830,他的意外是滇藏乱民,00:03:32.850,00:03:34.560,It's hard to tell ...
00:03:35.630,00:03:37.210,还是准葛尔细作所为,00:03:34.839,00:03:36.214,whether his accident
00:03:37.550,00:03:38.460,都不得而知,00:03:36.506,00:03:39.532,"was vandalism or caused by Dzungar spies,"
00:03:39.880,00:03:43.170,更或许还和宫里有关,00:03:40.980,00:03:42.488,or even ...
00:03:45.890,00:03:47.090,可无论是哪一种,00:03:42.988,00:03:44.770,someone related to the palace...
00:03:48.770,00:03:50.180,眼下凭我一己之力,00:03:46.766,00:03:48.357,But whoever did it ...
00:03:50.560,00:03:51.640,根本无法为他报仇,00:03:49.646,00:03:52.946,"I don't possess the ability to
revenge his death at the moment."
00:03:54.900,00:03:56.010,我腹中的孩子,00:03:56.000,00:03:57.600,The child inside my belly
00:03:58.230,00:03:59.850,注定要成为遗腹子了,00:03:59.273,00:04:01.416,is destined to be born without a father.
00:04:01.650,00:04:04.770,可是果郡王一脉不能因我而终止,00:04:02.690,00:04:06.034,"But the bloodline of Noble Prince Guo
must be preserved."
00:04:07.030,00:04:12.370,这个孩子我一定要给他一个名分,00:04:07.906,00:04:09.425,This child ...
,,,00:04:11.635,00:04:14.187,I must give him a rightful status
00:04:13.370,00:04:14.410,好好长大,00:04:14.187,00:04:16.132,and properly raise him.
00:04:16.630,00:04:17.990,还有我的父亲,00:04:17.608,00:04:19.123,And my father...
00:04:19.630,00:04:21.040,我从前步步隐忍,,,
00:04:21.420,00:04:22.830,只为能保住他们平安,00:04:20.711,00:04:22.685,I exercised restraint every step I took
,,,00:04:22.685,00:04:24.401,only trying to protect my family.
00:04:24.180,00:04:27.290,可是如今父亲突然病重在甯古塔,00:04:25.056,00:04:26.619,But now my father ...
,,,00:04:26.828,00:04:28.763,suddenly fell ill in Ningguta ...
00:04:28.970,00:04:30.340,我不能眼睁睁看着他,00:04:30.000,00:04:31.596,I can't bear imagining him ...
00:04:30.720,00:04:33.470,娘子你想要做到这些,00:04:31.596,00:04:32.872,"Mistress,"
,,,00:04:33.224,00:04:35.483,there is only one person under heaven
00:04:34.390,00:04:37.430,这天下可就只有一个人能帮你啊,00:04:35.483,00:04:38.720,who can help you achieve all this.
00:04:40.480,00:04:41.140,不错,00:04:41.356,00:04:42.490,Correct.
00:04:44.780,00:04:46.020,允礼曾告诉我,00:04:45.701,00:04:47.198,Yunli told me that
00:04:48.870,00:04:52.860,皇上曾在梦中唤我的名字,00:04:49.746,00:04:51.215,His Majesty
,,,00:04:51.966,00:04:54.419,called my name while he was unconscious.
00:04:54.920,00:04:56.530,我虽然没有十足的把握,00:04:56.020,00:04:58.089,I'm not entirely sure how ...
00:04:58.420,00:04:59.780,但我要尽力一试,00:04:59.296,00:05:01.273,but I will do my utmost to ...
00:05:02.710,00:05:04.050,我要用皇上的手,00:05:03.591,00:05:05.871,use His Majesty's hand
00:05:05.680,00:05:09.170,皇上的权力来报仇,00:05:06.780,00:05:08.511,and his power
00:05:10.100,00:05:10.800,娘子,00:05:09.595,00:05:11.187,to take revenge.
,,,00:05:11.187,00:05:12.226,"Mistress,"
00:05:11.350,00:05:14.060,这一步可是难之又难 险之又险,00:05:12.226,00:05:15.186,this is the hardest and riskiest move.
00:05:15.810,00:05:17.020,你想清楚了吗,00:05:16.686,00:05:18.450,Have you really thought this through?
00:05:17.770,00:05:18.850,我还有退路吗,00:05:18.691,00:05:21.286,There is no other path forward.
00:05:20.940,00:05:22.020,允礼死了,00:05:21.861,00:05:23.328,Yunli is already dead -
00:05:24.780,00:05:28.860,我这一己之身还有什么可顾忌的,00:05:25.656,00:05:28.091,What is there to care about?
,,,00:05:28.425,00:05:30.334,My body is an empty shell.
00:05:30.030,00:05:31.070,小姐的意思,00:05:30.951,00:05:32.170,"My Lady,"
00:05:31.540,00:05:33.280,是要和皇上重修于好吗,00:05:32.598,00:05:34.852,is your plan to reconcile with His Majesty?
00:05:35.210,00:05:37.160,若是小姐和皇上在此相会,00:05:36.041,00:05:38.260,"If you meet His Majesty here,"
00:05:37.870,00:05:39.160,恐怕只瞒得了一时,00:05:38.701,00:05:40.703,I'm afraid that sooner than later
00:05:40.170,00:05:42.000,要是有朝一日惊动了宫中,00:05:40.995,00:05:43.151,the harem would be alarmed
00:05:42.630,00:05:43.620,有人起了杀机,00:05:43.151,00:05:45.131,and someone would want to kill us.
00:05:44.210,00:05:46.830,那咱们就只能坐以待毙了,00:05:45.131,00:05:46.246,Then we could only ...
,,,00:05:46.650,00:05:48.076,sit here and wait for death.
00:05:52.350,00:05:53.090,回宫,00:05:53.450,00:05:55.387,We will return to the palace.
00:06:15.290,00:06:15.950,温大人,,,
00:06:17.330,00:06:17.990,嬛儿,00:06:16.390,00:06:17.550,Dr. Wen.
00:06:20.500,00:06:21.660,我很难看是不是,00:06:18.430,00:06:19.465,Huan'er.
00:06:22.540,00:06:24.000,怎么能这么说呢,00:06:21.600,00:06:23.052,"I look terrible, don't I?"
00:06:24.420,00:06:26.710,只是近几日气血有些不足,00:06:23.640,00:06:25.183,"No, why would you say that?"
00:06:27.590,00:06:28.460,面色有些黯淡,00:06:25.520,00:06:28.060,"It's just that your qi and circulation have been poor,"
00:06:29.760,00:06:30.710,我有着身孕,00:06:28.466,00:06:30.167,which makes your skin look dull.
00:06:31.550,00:06:33.040,气血不足对孩子不好,00:06:30.860,00:06:34.120,Insufficiency of qi and blood does no good to the baby inside me.
00:06:34.510,00:06:36.550,劳烦你开些益气补血的药给我,00:06:35.610,00:06:38.359,"May I trouble you to prescribe some
  herbs that will build my qi and blood?"
00:06:37.680,00:06:38.340,还有,00:06:38.780,00:06:39.649,"Also,"
00:06:39.480,00:06:41.590,从前的神仙玉女粉还在吗,00:06:40.311,00:06:42.825,do you still have the Immortal Jade Maiden Powder?
00:06:43.150,00:06:44.060,这好端端的,,,
00:06:44.360,00:06:45.770,怎么想起神仙玉女粉来了,00:06:44.250,00:06:46.800,What do you need that powder for?
00:06:46.440,00:06:48.180,小姐执意要把孩子生下来,00:06:47.361,00:06:49.453,"My Lady is determined to keep the child,"
00:06:49.150,00:06:50.990,只是小姐这样憔悴支离,,,
00:06:51.410,00:06:53.400,生出来的孩子又怎会好看呢,00:06:50.000,00:06:54.634,but how can the baby look well if My Lady is withered like this?
00:06:54.120,00:06:56.320,所以要吃一些益气补血的吃食,00:06:55.220,00:06:57.680,"So she needs not only healthy foods and tonics,"
00:06:56.580,00:06:58.690,再加上神仙玉女粉内外兼养,00:06:57.680,00:07:00.000,but also the powder to improve her complexion.
00:07:00.960,00:07:03.620,你肯好好地待自己就最好不过了,00:07:01.794,00:07:04.966,I can't be happier to see you treating yourself well.
00:07:04.090,00:07:05.540,那些益气补血的药月善,,,
00:07:05.960,00:07:07.120,要见效快的才好,00:07:05.133,00:07:08.412,Make sure the herbs are quick acting ...
00:07:08.300,00:07:09.210,我讨厌看到自己,,,
00:07:09.590,00:07:10.500,这样病怏怏的样子,00:07:09.400,00:07:11.600,I hate seeing this haggard face.
00:07:10.930,00:07:11.590,好,00:07:12.030,00:07:12.857,I will.
00:07:12.220,00:07:15.130,益气补血用东阿阿胶即可见效,00:07:13.320,00:07:16.230,"Ejiao is very effective for replenishing qi
and enriching the blood."
00:07:15.760,00:07:17.380,我会每日配了拿给槿汐,00:07:16.860,00:07:19.200,I will prepare it and send it to Jinxi daily.
00:07:18.520,00:07:19.630,你一定要细心调养,00:07:19.396,00:07:21.197,Please do nurse and nourish yourself.
00:07:20.440,00:07:21.890,来我给你把把脉吧,00:07:21.540,00:07:23.541,"Here, let me take your pulse."
00:07:35.370,00:07:37.360,脉象滑而冲和并无不妥,00:07:36.470,00:07:38.585,"Your pulse is smooth and strong.
All is well."
00:07:37.830,00:07:39.860,嬛儿你一定要悉心调理,00:07:38.930,00:07:40.960,"Huan'er, you must attend to yourself carefully."
00:07:40.160,00:07:41.150,切勿再伤心动气了,00:07:40.960,00:07:42.667,Don't let sad emotions affect your qi.
00:07:42.960,00:07:44.070,太医院恐有差遣,,,
00:07:44.750,00:07:45.830,我还得回宫候命,00:07:44.060,00:07:47.600,"The Imperial Infirmary might have tasks for me today.
I have to return to the palace now."
00:07:46.540,00:07:47.780,药我会尽早给送过来,00:07:47.640,00:07:49.492,I will send the herbs as soon as possible.
00:07:49.630,00:07:50.500,槿汐,,,
00:07:50.840,00:07:51.800,你且送送温太医,00:07:50.730,00:07:52.900,"Jinxi, please see Dr. Wen out."
00:07:52.010,00:07:53.840,是温大人,00:07:52.900,00:07:53.796,Yes.
,,,00:07:54.213,00:07:56.023,"After you, Dr. Wen."
00:07:59.350,00:08:02.390,我要回宫的事先别叫他知道,00:08:00.450,00:08:02.005,Don't tell him yet ...
,,,00:08:02.422,00:08:04.217,about my plan to return to the palace.
00:08:03.900,00:08:04.510,是,00:08:04.821,00:08:05.621,Yes.
00:08:07.070,00:08:08.850,终究不过是以色事人,00:08:08.170,00:08:10.950,"All I can do now is ""adorn myself to please others""."
00:08:29.880,00:08:30.710,好香啊,00:08:30.711,00:08:31.931,You smell sweet.
00:08:33.470,00:08:35.000,皇上惯会取笑臣妾,00:08:34.570,00:08:36.369,Your Majesty always likes to tease me.
00:08:35.550,00:08:36.630,朕会诳你吗,00:08:36.650,00:08:38.000,Why would I lie to you?
00:08:51.030,00:08:52.270,皇上又在延禧宫,,,
00:08:52.650,00:08:55.060,是皇上身子好了以后,00:08:51.697,00:08:53.750,His Majesty went to the Palace of Prolonging Happiness again?
00:08:55.320,00:08:57.530,最常去的就是延禧宫和春禧殿,00:08:53.750,00:08:58.824,"Yes, since His Majesty recovered,
he has been visiting Concubine An and Lady Paix the most."
00:08:58.490,00:09:01.700,甯贵人已经不用担心 倒是安嫔,00:08:59.366,00:09:02.576,"There is no need to worry about Lady Paix,
but for Concubine An ..."
00:09:02.790,00:09:04.370,安嫔娘娘看似温顺,,,
00:09:04.790,00:09:06.250,心思却不好琢磨,00:09:03.890,00:09:05.890,"Her Highness Concubine An seems obedient,"
00:09:06.420,00:09:08.530,本宫不让她生她有什么法子,00:09:05.890,00:09:07.517,but her mind is not easy to predict.
00:09:09.250,00:09:10.370,你告诉绘春,00:09:07.517,00:09:09.797,What can she do when I don't allow her to have a baby?
00:09:10.670,00:09:11.790,每次侍寝后,,,
00:09:12.050,00:09:14.630,都要盯着安嫔服用避孕的汤药,00:09:10.350,00:09:15.520,"Tell Spring to watch Consort An taking the
contraceptive tonics after every service"
00:09:14.970,00:09:15.830,以免后患,,,
00:09:16.090,00:09:16.710,是,00:09:15.903,00:09:17.190,to avoid future troubles.
,,,00:09:17.190,00:09:18.060,Yes.
00:09:33.650,00:09:34.230,宝鹃,00:09:34.750,00:09:35.664,Coua.
00:09:40.330,00:09:41.820,快去把这香炉里的东西倒了,00:09:41.161,00:09:42.651,Go empty the censer quickly.
00:09:42.040,00:09:42.620,是,00:09:43.140,00:09:44.054,Yes.
00:09:47.960,00:09:48.700,槿汐,00:09:48.836,00:09:49.776,"Jinxi,"
00:09:49.000,00:09:51.160,这宫里有没有什么人,,,
00:09:51.800,00:09:53.380,能在皇上面前说上话的,00:09:49.776,00:09:54.156,"do you know anyone in the palace who
can influence His Majesty's opinion?"
00:09:53.880,00:09:55.210,现如今能在皇上面前,,,
00:09:55.510,00:09:57.540,说得上话的只有苏培盛,00:09:54.756,00:09:58.416,Su Peisheng is the only one who can do that for us.
00:09:58.640,00:10:00.380,他从小伺候皇上长大,00:09:59.740,00:10:01.563,He has been serving His Majesty since a young age
00:10:00.680,00:10:01.920,最了解皇上的性子,00:10:01.563,00:10:03.200,and knows His Majesty's temperament the best.
00:10:02.930,00:10:04.590,娘子若想设法回宫,00:10:03.806,00:10:05.967,"If you are planning a way to return to the palace,"
00:10:05.810,00:10:08.640,必须要有能碰得上皇上的机会,00:10:06.910,00:10:09.740,you have to find a chance to meet His Majesty.
00:10:10.440,00:10:11.930,可如今我们在宫外,,,
00:10:12.900,00:10:15.060,身边实在没有什么,00:10:11.540,00:10:13.573,But we are not in the palace now.
00:10:15.570,00:10:17.230,可以让他为我所用的东西了,00:10:14.000,00:10:18.320,I have nothing to exchange for Su Peisheng's help.
00:10:19.450,00:10:20.310,娘子错了,,,
00:10:21.370,00:10:23.150,苏培盛跟着皇上一辈子,00:10:20.326,00:10:21.690,"Not nothing, Mistress."
00:10:23.490,00:10:24.320,什么没见过,00:10:22.470,00:10:25.490,"What hasn't Su Peisheng seen
through his life-long service to His Majesty?"
00:10:24.830,00:10:26.820,收买苏培盛最好的办法,,,
00:10:27.120,00:10:28.490,绝不是金帛和利益,00:10:25.706,00:10:29.336,Treasures or benefits might have little effect.
00:10:29.420,00:10:30.150,那,,,
00:10:30.380,00:10:32.160,苏培盛是身子残缺的人,00:10:30.520,00:10:31.480,Then...
00:10:32.840,00:10:34.250,不能娶妻生子,00:10:31.480,00:10:33.385,Su Peisheng is not physically complete.
00:10:34.920,00:10:36.910,才是他一辈子最大的苦楚,00:10:33.940,00:10:38.000,"Having no chance to start a family is
the deepest distress in his life."
00:10:37.840,00:10:40.170,所以宫中才有太监,,,
00:10:40.510,00:10:43.050,偷偷地与宫女相好结成对食,00:10:38.940,00:10:44.160,"That's why some eunuchs and maids in
the palace secretly become ""eat-together partners“."
00:10:44.310,00:10:47.590,就当彼此安慰彼此的苦处,00:10:45.410,00:10:50.040,"After all, ""half a bowl is better than no rice at all."""
00:10:48.020,00:10:48.970,聊胜于无,,,
00:10:49.390,00:10:50.010,槿汐,,,
00:10:50.730,00:10:52.340,我不许你为我做这样的事情,00:10:50.490,00:10:51.402,"Jinxi,"
00:10:53.610,00:10:55.060,这是最好的打算了,00:10:51.830,00:10:53.690,I won't allow you to do this for me.
00:10:56.230,00:10:57.820,奴婢与苏培盛是同乡,00:10:54.710,00:10:56.369,This is our best option.
00:10:58.400,00:10:59.440,奴婢刚入宫时,00:10:57.315,00:10:59.293,Su Peisheng and I are from the same hometown.
00:10:59.700,00:11:02.480,苏培盛对奴婢也是颇为照顾的,00:10:59.500,00:11:03.520,"He helped me greatly when I first became
a maid in the harem."
00:11:03.740,00:11:05.230,而且入宫这么多年,00:11:04.840,00:11:07.199,"Besides, after all these years..."
00:11:06.200,00:11:09.440,苏培盛对奴婢也并非无意,00:11:07.407,00:11:10.478,he does still have some feelings towards me.
00:11:10.330,00:11:12.370,奴婢愿意尽力一试,00:11:11.161,00:11:13.201,I'm willing to try my best.
00:11:12.580,00:11:13.290,槿汐,,,
00:11:13.960,00:11:15.080,你跟着我已经受尽了,00:11:13.201,00:11:14.286,"Jinxi,"
00:11:15.420,00:11:16.410,旁人没有受过的辛苦,00:11:14.836,00:11:17.440,you've already endured too many ordeals living with me.
00:11:17.130,00:11:18.090,现下还要为了我,,,
00:11:18.800,00:11:20.000,要与他结为对食,00:11:18.006,00:11:19.520,Now you are even going to...
00:11:21.430,00:11:23.040,这在宫中虽是常见,00:11:19.770,00:11:21.789,"become his ""eat-together partner"" for me."
00:11:23.850,00:11:25.090,可他终究不是男子,00:11:22.530,00:11:24.390,"I know it is common in the harem,"
00:11:25.260,00:11:26.000,娘子,00:11:24.783,00:11:26.190,"but after all, he is not a complete man..."
,,,00:11:26.190,00:11:26.930,"Mistress,"
00:11:26.810,00:11:29.340,这条路奴婢已经想得很明白了,00:11:27.910,00:11:30.606,I've thought this through
00:11:30.310,00:11:31.770,你再劝也是没有用的,00:11:31.023,00:11:32.923,and I won't let you change my mind.
00:11:32.270,00:11:33.390,奴婢不是说过,,,
00:11:34.060,00:11:35.300,只要你决意回宫,00:11:33.101,00:11:34.950,I said that
00:11:35.820,00:11:37.600,奴婢为你做什么都是愿意的,00:11:35.159,00:11:39.179,"I would do anything for you
since you're determined to return to the palace."
00:11:39.530,00:11:43.020,至于以后不赌如何知道,00:11:40.361,00:11:44.160,Who knows about the future if we don't take the chance now?
00:11:43.740,00:11:44.730,万一幸运,00:11:44.795,00:11:46.160,"If I'm lucky,"
00:11:45.780,00:11:50.120,苏培盛就是奴婢终身的依靠了,00:11:46.880,00:11:51.355,Su Peisheng will be the one I rely on all life long.
00:11:54.330,00:11:55.570,奴婢去收拾收拾,00:11:55.430,00:11:57.273,I will go get ready.
00:11:58.420,00:11:59.250,你要去哪儿啊,00:11:59.520,00:12:01.120,Where are you going?
00:12:01.590,00:12:03.500,苏培盛在宫外有一个私宅,00:12:02.690,00:12:04.892,"Su Peisheng has a private residence outside the palace,"
00:12:04.550,00:12:05.670,奴婢知道在哪里,00:12:05.426,00:12:07.024,and I know its location.
00:12:06.510,00:12:07.920,也有把握能见到他,00:12:07.610,00:12:09.284,I'm confident I'll find him there.
00:12:08.850,00:12:11.970,槿汐你实在不必为我这样,00:12:09.950,00:12:13.070,"Jinxi, you truly don't need to do this for me."
00:12:12.560,00:12:13.890,咱们总还有别的法子,00:12:13.660,00:12:15.115,We can find another way.
00:12:14.310,00:12:15.800,这是最好的法子了,00:12:15.410,00:12:16.983,This is the best way.
00:12:17.360,00:12:20.770,再说娘子回宫本对苏培盛无害,00:12:18.460,00:12:21.870,"Besides, your return to the palace does no harm to Su Peisheng."
00:12:21.530,00:12:23.860,如果有一天娘子真的再复得宠,00:12:22.406,00:12:25.028,"If one day you regain His Majesty's favor,"
00:12:24.240,00:12:25.700,对苏培盛只有好处,00:12:25.340,00:12:27.409,Su Peisheng will only benefit from it.
00:12:26.910,00:12:31.200,再加上奴婢的一些微薄力量,00:12:28.010,00:12:32.300,"With what little I am capable of,"
00:12:32.250,00:12:34.110,此事便可有把握,00:12:33.350,00:12:35.502,we can make sure that it happens.
00:12:35.750,00:12:36.740,娘子放心,00:12:36.581,00:12:38.371,"Don't worry, Mistress."
00:12:48.220,00:12:51.340,槿汐是你,00:12:49.096,00:12:50.642,Jinxi?
00:12:53.060,00:12:53.670,来人,00:12:51.575,00:12:53.160,It's you.
00:12:53.940,00:12:54.590,来了,00:12:54.160,00:12:55.040,"Someone, come here."
00:12:55.190,00:12:56.640,换上皇上新赏的茶叶,00:12:55.040,00:12:55.773,Yes.
,,,00:12:56.290,00:12:58.408,Replace this with the tea His Majesty granted me.
00:12:59.360,00:13:00.190,先喝我的吧,00:13:00.236,00:13:01.623,You can drink mine first.
00:13:04.860,00:13:05.850,多谢苏公公,00:13:05.736,00:13:07.040,"Thank you, Mr. Su."
00:13:06.740,00:13:08.530,自个儿家里别那么生分,00:13:07.040,00:13:09.630,"You don't have to be so polite.
Make yourself at home."
00:13:08.910,00:13:09.820,叫我的名吧,,,
00:13:10.660,00:13:11.320,培盛,00:13:10.010,00:13:11.378,Call me by my name.
00:13:13.040,00:13:13.700,坐坐坐,00:13:11.760,00:13:12.800,Peisheng.
,,,00:13:14.140,00:13:15.092,Sit down.
00:13:15.250,00:13:18.580,这宅子新装了住得可舒心呢,00:13:16.126,00:13:18.064,Your residence is newly refurbished...
,,,00:13:18.697,00:13:20.281,How do you like it?
00:13:19.630,00:13:23.250,还行只是一个人住有点冷清了,00:13:20.281,00:13:24.671,"Not bad, it's just a little cold and quiet living here alone."
00:13:26.130,00:13:27.540,这么多年也都惯了,00:13:27.120,00:13:29.120,But I'm used to it after so many years.
00:13:29.100,00:13:33.210,那我现在才来说要陪你,00:13:30.000,00:13:31.488,Then...
00:13:34.770,00:13:35.680,有些晚了,00:13:32.480,00:13:37.215,"Would it be too late if I say I want
to come here to accompany you?"
00:13:42.980,00:13:47.190,怎么你终于肯了,00:13:43.856,00:13:45.236,So you...
,,,00:13:46.070,00:13:48.313,You are finally saying yes to me?
00:13:51.410,00:13:54.320,累了一天了腿酸了吧,00:13:52.241,00:13:55.151,"You must have sore legs after
a whole day's work."
00:13:57.000,00:13:59.660,其实这世上的事情,,,
00:14:00.000,00:14:01.210,就是这样千回百转,00:13:57.741,00:14:02.401,Life is composed of innumerable twists and turns.
00:14:01.840,00:14:03.040,该是谁身边的人,00:14:02.940,00:14:04.169,"But eventually,"
00:14:04.630,00:14:06.040,就会到谁身边去,00:14:04.618,00:14:07.883,everyone finds their way to the one they belong with.
00:14:08.220,00:14:10.750,只是可怜了莞嫔,00:14:09.096,00:14:12.320,It's just unfortunate that Concubine Sourire
00:14:11.550,00:14:13.970,从此便孤身一人无人照拂了,00:14:12.708,00:14:14.936,will be alone and unattended.
00:14:16.430,00:14:17.720,实在是有些不忍,00:14:17.530,00:14:19.767,I don't have the heart to see that happen.
00:14:20.190,00:14:22.980,你是指莞嫔和皇上,00:14:21.066,00:14:24.656,Are you thinking ... Concubine Sourire and His Majesty...?
00:14:24.360,00:14:25.350,你可有把握,00:14:25.236,00:14:27.016,Do you suppose it could happen?
00:14:27.700,00:14:29.110,若是莞嫔还有机会,00:14:28.800,00:14:30.585,"If Concubine Sourire still has a chance,"
00:14:29.950,00:14:32.690,那我岂不是也能两全其美,00:14:30.826,00:14:34.736,"then that would allow us to also have a happy ending,
instead of disappointment."
00:14:33.030,00:14:33.860,各不辜负了,,,
00:14:37.120,00:14:39.160,眼下宫中皇上身边,,,
00:14:39.580,00:14:40.950,正缺一个可意的人,00:14:38.220,00:14:42.050,"At the moment, His Majesty lacks
a concubine he's deeply fond of."
00:14:42.170,00:14:44.250,只是宫中皇后独大,00:14:43.046,00:14:45.472,But the Empress is dominant in the harem now.
00:14:45.130,00:14:47.460,莞嫔要是以废妃的身份入宫,00:14:46.230,00:14:48.849,"As a banished concubine, I'm afraid it would be very difficult for"
00:14:48.050,00:14:49.080,恐怕太难哪,00:14:48.849,00:14:50.680,Concubine Sourire to re-enter the harem.
00:14:50.890,00:14:54.170,难不难的谋事在人成事在天,00:14:51.766,00:14:55.360,"Whether it's difficult or not,
""people propose and Heaven disposes."""
00:14:55.220,00:14:56.300,尽力就好,00:14:56.294,00:14:58.124,We can only do the best we can.
00:14:58.980,00:15:00.220,若是皇上有一天,,,
00:15:00.900,00:15:02.640,能和莞嫔重新在一起,00:15:00.080,00:15:03.740,"If one day His Majesty accepts Concubine Sourire's return,"
00:15:04.570,00:15:07.020,那你我岂不是,,,
00:15:07.400,00:15:08.810,也顺理成章地在一块了,00:15:05.670,00:15:09.910,then wouldn't it be natural for you and I to be together?
00:15:22.040,00:15:22.700,来了,00:15:23.140,00:15:24.134,He's here.
00:15:24.340,00:15:24.990,苏公公,00:15:25.440,00:15:26.465,Mr. Su.
00:15:27.460,00:15:29.450,奴才给娘娘请安,00:15:28.560,00:15:30.550,Peace to Your Highness.
00:15:29.920,00:15:31.710,公公免礼 快坐,00:15:30.751,00:15:32.631,"Sir, no need to bow. Have a seat."
00:15:32.300,00:15:32.920,多谢娘娘,,,
00:15:33.090,00:15:33.800,浣碧上茶,00:15:33.400,00:15:34.984,"- I thank Your Highness.
- Jade, the tea."
00:15:34.600,00:15:35.250,坐,00:15:35.700,00:15:36.684,Please sit.
00:15:38.060,00:15:39.420,我早已不是娘娘了,00:15:38.936,00:15:40.553,I am no longer a Concubine.
00:15:40.140,00:15:41.470,公公不该这么叫的,,,
00:15:42.900,00:15:44.510,奴才这么称呼娘娘,00:15:41.240,00:15:43.112,"You shouldn't address me like that, sir."
00:15:44.980,00:15:46.350,自有奴才的缘故,00:15:44.000,00:15:47.450,I have my own reasons to address Your Highness that way.
00:15:47.320,00:15:49.600,公公此话我就不懂了,00:15:48.196,00:15:50.720,I don't quite understand what you mean by that.
00:15:52.200,00:15:54.400,那日槿汐来找奴才,00:15:53.300,00:15:55.750,Jinxi came to me the other day.
00:15:55.580,00:15:56.860,虽然没多说什么,,,
00:15:57.490,00:15:59.980,但是奴才也猜得出几分,00:15:56.456,00:16:00.856,"She didn't say much, but I was able to guess some of it."
00:16:00.830,00:16:05.540,如今见娘娘虽居禅房却容光焕发,00:16:01.930,00:16:06.830,"Now that I see Your Highness's radiant
complexion despite living in a temple,"
00:16:06.040,00:16:07.780,奴才心里就更有数了,00:16:07.122,00:16:09.255,I am more certain of how things stand.
00:16:08.550,00:16:10.460,那公公此来又是为何呢,00:16:09.650,00:16:11.852,"Then sir, what brought you here today?"
00:16:11.340,00:16:12.710,奴才是来道贺,00:16:12.440,00:16:14.380,I am here to congratulate Your Highness
00:16:13.590,00:16:16.210,恭贺娘娘心愿必可达成,00:16:14.380,00:16:17.310,that your wish will come true.
00:16:18.060,00:16:19.170,公公何出此言,00:16:19.058,00:16:20.764,Why do you say that?
00:16:21.310,00:16:22.010,娘娘,00:16:22.410,00:16:23.485,"Your Highness,"
00:16:22.940,00:16:24.850,奴才在皇上身边多年,00:16:24.040,00:16:26.158,I have attended His Majesty for many years.
00:16:25.560,00:16:28.310,皇上想些什么倒也能够揣测几分,00:16:26.660,00:16:29.577,I am somewhat able to fathom how His Majesty thinks.
00:16:29.360,00:16:31.720,当年若非娘娘执意不肯,,,
00:16:31.940,00:16:32.900,向皇上低头,00:16:30.460,00:16:34.224,"If it were not for Your Highness's refusal to
bend to His Majesty's will at that time,"
00:16:33.530,00:16:35.650,皇上怎么舍得让娘娘出宫呢,00:16:34.630,00:16:37.170,"how would His Majesty have had the heart
to let you leave the palace?"
00:16:36.070,00:16:38.860,要不如今也总在妃位了可不是,00:16:37.170,00:16:40.167,"Otherwise, Your Highness would have
been ranked a Consort now, right?"
00:16:39.540,00:16:42.490,从前的事就不必再提了,00:16:40.640,00:16:43.590,There's no need to talk of the past.
00:16:44.120,00:16:45.700,娘娘的意思是,00:16:45.220,00:16:46.800,What does Your Highness mean?
00:16:46.540,00:16:48.030,我当年任性离宫,00:16:47.640,00:16:49.444,I willfully insisted on leaving the palace.
00:16:48.540,00:16:49.830,然而我家中得罪,00:16:49.640,00:16:51.431,But my family was convicted -
00:16:50.920,00:16:53.130,我又有何脸目再侍奉皇上,00:16:52.020,00:16:54.605,I no longer have the standing to serve His Majesty.
00:16:54.510,00:16:58.130,离宫这几年我也十分想念皇上,00:16:55.565,00:16:59.185,Since leaving the palace I've missed His Majesty very much.
00:16:59.220,00:17:02.760,种种情由还请公公代为转达,00:17:00.320,00:17:03.860,"Mr. Su, I hope you can impart
my thoughts and feelings to His Majesty."
00:17:02.930,00:17:03.590,是,00:17:04.030,00:17:04.940,Yes.
00:17:04.480,00:17:08.060,娘娘当年是奉旨到甘露寺修行,00:17:05.580,00:17:09.160,"Your Highness was sent to the
Temple of Pure Dew by His Majesty's decree."
00:17:08.860,00:17:09.970,如今却在这里,,,
00:17:10.780,00:17:12.770,其实奴才心里边也明白,00:17:09.960,00:17:11.487,"Then, Your Highness moved here."
00:17:13.030,00:17:14.940,必定是在甘露寺受了委屈,00:17:11.880,00:17:16.040,"I can surmise that Your Highness must
have endured unfair treatment at the temple."
00:17:15.740,00:17:17.070,这里荒山野岭的,,,
00:17:18.200,00:17:19.480,娘娘您受苦了,00:17:16.840,00:17:19.128,Living in such desolate quarters in the mountains ...
00:17:20.200,00:17:21.740,其实日子苦些怕什么,00:17:19.128,00:17:21.243,must have caused much suffering to Your Highness.
00:17:22.870,00:17:24.360,只怕心里更不安乐,00:17:21.243,00:17:23.575,There's nothing to be afraid of from material hardship.
00:17:26.170,00:17:28.250,我若此生还有机会,00:17:23.970,00:17:25.893,I'm only afraid of the unhappiness in my heart.
00:17:28.540,00:17:30.120,再见皇上和公主一面,00:17:27.046,00:17:30.996,"If I had a chance to see His Majesty
and the princess once again in my life,"
00:17:31.090,00:17:32.420,那我便死也瞑目了,00:17:32.190,00:17:34.271,I would be able to rest in peace when I die.
00:17:38.300,00:17:40.590,承蒙娘娘昔日对奴才的关爱,00:17:39.400,00:17:42.160,"I am thankful for the good graces
Your Highness bestowed on me in the past."
00:17:41.060,00:17:43.170,这件事奴才必当尽力,00:17:42.160,00:17:44.270,I will do my utmost.
00:17:44.640,00:17:45.510,公公请起,,,
00:17:46.480,00:17:47.560,只是世事无常,00:17:45.740,00:17:46.902,Please rise.
00:17:48.310,00:17:50.140,只怕皇上早有新人在侧,00:17:47.356,00:17:49.044,Nothing is constant in this world.
00:17:51.360,00:17:52.520,早已经忘了我了,00:17:49.268,00:17:51.949,"I'm afraid His Majesty already has
new concubines by his side"
00:17:54.150,00:17:55.140,娘娘言重了,00:17:52.460,00:17:54.085,and has long forgotten me.
00:17:56.320,00:17:57.980,奴才若没有几分把握,00:17:55.250,00:17:56.856,Your Highness should not say so.
00:17:58.320,00:18:00.030,也不敢贸然地来见娘娘,00:17:57.420,00:17:59.080,"If I didn't have some confidence,"
,,,00:17:59.080,00:18:01.309,I wouldn't have come to see Your Highness so suddenly.
00:18:00.410,00:18:03.700,这么说公公心中早有良策了,00:18:01.510,00:18:05.102,"By that, sir, do you mean you already have a good plan?"
00:18:05.450,00:18:06.910,自娘娘出宫了以后,00:18:06.550,00:18:08.302,"Since Your Highness left the harem,"
00:18:07.460,00:18:10.120,皇上心里十分惦记着娘娘,00:18:08.560,00:18:11.345,His Majesty has always had you in his heart.
00:18:10.920,00:18:12.580,可是以皇上天子之威,,,
00:18:12.880,00:18:15.960,是绝不可能低头来就范娘娘的,00:18:11.796,00:18:17.015,"However, as the Emperor, His Majesty
will not bend his head and give in to Your Highness."
00:18:16.880,00:18:19.540,娘娘冰雪聪明往细里想就知道,00:18:17.980,00:18:20.890,"Your Highness has a brilliant mind and
will understand if you think it through."
00:18:20.550,00:18:21.960,若不是皇上默许,,,
00:18:22.510,00:18:23.920,即便有太后赞成,00:18:21.323,00:18:23.250,"If it weren't for His Majesty's implicit approval,"
00:18:24.310,00:18:25.220,这两年芳若,00:18:23.250,00:18:25.381,"even if the Empress Dowager allowed it,"
00:18:25.560,00:18:27.220,能这么频频地来看娘娘,00:18:25.381,00:18:29.079,"how could Madam Orchid have visited
Your Highness so frequently over the past years?"
00:18:31.020,00:18:32.180,皇上病重的时候,,,
00:18:32.480,00:18:34.720,从未唤过纯元皇后以外的人,00:18:32.120,00:18:33.815,"When His Majesty was sick in the past,"
00:18:35.230,00:18:36.600,娘娘可是头一位呀,00:18:33.815,00:18:36.064,he called out no one's name other than Empress Première's.
00:18:37.700,00:18:38.860,那日太后也在,00:18:36.064,00:18:37.760,Your Highness was the first exception.
00:18:39.240,00:18:40.520,可把她吓了一跳呢,00:18:38.800,00:18:40.340,The Empress Dowager was present that day.
,,,00:18:40.340,00:18:42.010,It surprised Her Majesty greatly.
00:18:42.240,00:18:44.400,这就是皇上对娘娘的旧情,00:18:43.340,00:18:45.652,"This shows His Majesty's enduring affection for Your Highness,"
00:18:44.740,00:18:46.450,也是十分要紧的旧情啊,00:18:45.652,00:18:47.550,which matters very much.
00:18:48.210,00:18:49.290,实不相瞒,,,
00:18:49.620,00:18:51.290,果郡王当时也在场,00:18:49.086,00:18:50.496,"To tell the truth,"
00:18:51.580,00:18:53.250,他也听到皇上的呓语,00:18:50.496,00:18:52.506,State Prince Guo was present as well.
,,,00:18:52.680,00:18:54.726,He heard His Majesty saying this in his sleep.
00:18:54.630,00:18:56.750,可惜王爷是再回不来了,00:18:55.730,00:18:57.975,"Unfortunately, His Lordship won't be coming back anymore."
00:18:57.210,00:18:58.670,王爷怎就回不来了呢,00:18:58.310,00:19:00.000,How is it that His Lordship is not coming back?
00:19:00.720,00:19:03.380,这原是宫中秘事本不该说的,00:19:01.820,00:19:04.939,"That's meant to remain secret in the palace.
I  shouldn't have mentioned it."
00:19:04.850,00:19:07.510,皇上的意思又是秘不发丧,00:19:05.950,00:19:08.860,His Majesty does not intend to announce his death.
00:19:09.980,00:19:10.890,可惜呀,00:19:11.080,00:19:12.365,How sad.
00:19:11.520,00:19:14.350,果郡王这一脉到这儿给生生断了,00:19:12.620,00:19:15.450,State Prince Guo's bloodline ended so abruptly.
00:19:18.110,00:19:20.600,娘娘累了吧喝口水再说吧,00:19:19.210,00:19:21.790,"Your Highness must be tired.
Please have some water before you continue."
00:19:24.330,00:19:26.860,王爷年纪轻轻的真是可怜,00:19:25.206,00:19:28.130,"His Lordship was young.
This is so unfortunate."
00:19:28.250,00:19:29.080,可不是吗,00:19:29.350,00:19:30.574,That's certainly true.
00:19:30.210,00:19:32.320,净顾着说别人的了,00:19:31.393,00:19:34.087,"Aiyo, we've been busy talking about others."
00:19:33.210,00:19:35.170,其实娘娘想要见皇上一面,00:19:34.310,00:19:36.270,"In fact, if Your Highness wishes to see His Majesty -"
00:19:35.460,00:19:36.450,也不是不能啊,00:19:36.270,00:19:37.550,That's not impossible.
00:19:37.210,00:19:39.700,前两日正说起二月二龙台头,00:19:38.086,00:19:40.800,"A couple of days ago, we were discussing
the incense offering and spring hike"
00:19:40.090,00:19:41.500,要敬香踏春的事情,,,
00:19:41.880,00:19:43.340,奴才就尽力地劝皇上,00:19:40.800,00:19:42.980,"for the Longtaitou Festival on the
second day of the second month."
00:19:43.680,00:19:44.840,到甘露寺来敬香,00:19:42.980,00:19:45.981,"I will try my best to convince His Majesty
to offer incense at the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:19:45.390,00:19:48.130,到时候再引皇上到凌云峰来吧,00:19:46.490,00:19:49.480,"At that time, I will prompt His Majesty
to come to Peak Lingyun."
00:19:49.270,00:19:50.100,难为公公,00:19:50.224,00:19:51.907,"Thank you for the trouble, Mr. Su."
00:19:51.270,00:19:54.140,此事不容易办,00:19:52.370,00:19:55.240,It is not... an easy task.
00:19:55.270,00:19:56.480,还请公公费心了,00:19:56.146,00:19:58.391,I appreciate you making such an effort.
00:19:57.480,00:19:59.100,倒也未必十分艰难,00:19:58.580,00:20:00.406,It's not necessarily very difficult.
00:19:59.530,00:20:01.390,且容奴才再想想法子,00:20:00.406,00:20:02.266,Please allow me to think of a way.
00:20:02.780,00:20:03.570,苏公公,,,
00:20:04.530,00:20:05.770,眼下我真不知道,00:20:03.611,00:20:04.834,Mr. Su.
00:20:06.620,00:20:08.280,该如何回报您这片心意,00:20:05.406,00:20:09.156,I really don't know how to repay your kindness at this time.
00:20:08.540,00:20:12.400,娘娘这件事奴才既是帮娘娘,00:20:09.640,00:20:11.191,Your Highness ...
,,,00:20:11.191,00:20:13.542,I am helping Your Highness
00:20:13.080,00:20:14.410,也是帮奴才自己,00:20:14.180,00:20:15.844,and also helping myself.
00:20:21.590,00:20:24.000,有什么事奴才会着人来报的,00:20:22.690,00:20:25.350,I will send someone if there is anything to report.
00:20:24.550,00:20:26.010,奴才先告辞了,00:20:25.650,00:20:27.319,Allow me to take my leave now.
00:20:27.180,00:20:29.010,浣碧去送一送,00:20:28.280,00:20:30.110,"Jade, please send Mr. Su on his way."
00:20:29.560,00:20:30.550,留步留步,00:20:30.470,00:20:31.990,"No need, please stay."
00:20:30.890,00:20:33.470,不用了奴婢去送就好了,00:20:31.990,00:20:34.720,"It's all right, Mistress. Allow me to accompany him."

00:20:57.590,00:20:58.920,你身上的这身衣裳,00:20:58.690,00:21:00.327,The clothes you are wearing now
00:20:59.630,00:21:01.290,都已经是前几年的样子了,00:21:00.506,00:21:02.855,look like they're from a few years ago.
00:21:03.470,00:21:04.380,也该换换了,00:21:04.494,00:21:05.898,You should have new clothing.

00:21:29.070,00:21:30.530,皇上驾到,00:21:28.880,00:21:30.000,Be careful!
00:21:33.790,00:21:34.740,皇上吉祥,00:21:30.170,00:21:31.797,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:21:34.960,00:21:35.540,起来吧,00:21:34.890,00:21:36.060,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:21:35.750,00:21:36.450,谢皇上,00:21:36.060,00:21:36.800,You may rise.
00:21:36.920,00:21:38.660,朕刚去看了皇额娘,00:21:36.850,00:21:38.020,I thank Your Majesty.
,,,00:21:38.020,00:21:40.000,I just visited Imperial Mother.
00:21:39.590,00:21:41.040,她的气色还是不太好,00:21:40.690,00:21:42.140,She still looks unwell.
00:21:41.960,00:21:43.750,听说你一直照顾着,00:21:43.060,00:21:44.892,I heard that you've been taking care of her.
00:21:44.170,00:21:46.380,臣妾孝敬太后是应该的,00:21:45.270,00:21:47.480,It is only my duty to attend to Her Majesty.
00:21:48.220,00:21:48.920,起来吧,00:21:49.320,00:21:50.187,Rise.
00:21:51.060,00:21:52.890,皇上您瞧这天气多好啊,00:21:51.891,00:21:53.721,"Your Majesty, the weather is so nice."
00:21:53.140,00:21:54.970,连惠嫔娘娘都带着小公主,,,
00:21:55.350,00:21:56.060,出来踏春了,00:21:54.016,00:21:56.936,"Concubine Vertu has brought the Princess out
to ""set foot on spring grass."""
00:21:57.270,00:21:57.970,是啊,,,
00:21:59.060,00:22:00.300,再过几日就是,00:21:58.370,00:21:59.237,Indeed.
00:22:00.650,00:22:02.230,二月二龙台头的日子了,00:22:00.160,00:22:04.182,"In a few days, it will be Longtaitou Festival.
[Dragon Raises its Head Festival]"
00:22:03.480,00:22:07.440,按理说是要踏春还要祈福敬香的,00:22:04.606,00:22:08.316,"The tradition is to do a spring hike
and incense offering."
00:22:08.110,00:22:11.150,皇上可还是要在宝华殿祈福,00:22:08.941,00:22:12.148,"Does Your Majesty want to offer prayers
at Baohua Hall as usual?"
00:22:11.870,00:22:15.700,年年都在宝华殿连宫都没出过,00:22:12.970,00:22:16.800,"I've been at the Baohua Hall every year,
never stepping outside the palace."
00:22:16.540,00:22:18.080,算什么踏青春游,00:22:17.371,00:22:19.305,What kind of spring hike is that?
00:22:19.250,00:22:21.490,朕可听说京城里的百姓,,,
00:22:21.790,00:22:25.750,在这日都要出游踏春赶庙会的,00:22:20.224,00:22:26.560,"I heard that people in the capital go out
for a trip and attend temple fairs."
00:22:25.920,00:22:26.580,是啊,00:22:26.560,00:22:27.647,They do.
00:22:27.170,00:22:28.130,与其如此,00:22:28.270,00:22:29.230,"If so,"
00:22:28.800,00:22:32.710,朕还是省省心在养心殿看折子吧,00:22:29.900,00:22:33.643,"I'd rather stay at the Hall of Mental
Cultivation to read my memorandums."
00:22:33.100,00:22:33.840,皇上,00:22:33.810,00:22:34.852," Your Majesty,"
00:22:34.520,00:22:36.220,龙台头可是大日子呀,00:22:35.584,00:22:37.870,Longtaitou is a big festival.
00:22:36.770,00:22:38.880,俗话说二月二龙台头,00:22:37.870,00:22:38.768,As the saying goes:
00:22:39.310,00:22:40.850,大仓满小仓流啊,00:22:38.768,00:22:42.330,"""The day the dragon raises its head,
come the blessings for plentiful crops."""
00:22:41.230,00:22:42.310,这可是祈求一年,,,
00:22:42.650,00:22:43.850,风调雨顺的大日子,00:22:42.330,00:22:44.691,This is the best day to pray for favorable winds and rains.
00:22:44.110,00:22:45.850,皇上您可别含糊着过了,00:22:44.960,00:22:46.950,Your Majesty shouldn't let it pass by.
00:22:46.530,00:22:48.140,这天民间的百姓,,,
00:22:48.450,00:22:50.110,最爱去拜花神迎春了,00:22:47.630,00:22:51.078,"On this day, the people love to worship
the Flower God to welcome the spring,"
00:22:50.450,00:22:52.560,可要数花神庙里边最热闹,00:22:51.078,00:22:53.705,"which makes the Flower God Temple
the busiest place of all."
00:22:53.080,00:22:54.530,那人山人海啊,00:22:53.705,00:22:55.630,I was sweating all over last year
00:22:54.990,00:22:57.610,去年奴才还被挤得满身是汗,00:22:56.090,00:22:58.710,amidst the huge crowds of people.
00:22:57.910,00:22:59.950,脚趾头都差点没踩烂了,00:22:59.010,00:23:01.050,My toe was almost crushed even!
00:23:00.580,00:23:02.320,皇上可是想去那儿,00:23:01.680,00:23:03.420,Does Your Majesty want to go there...?
00:23:02.540,00:23:04.160,人多太闹,00:23:03.640,00:23:05.260,The crowd is too noisy.
00:23:05.170,00:23:06.830,朕可不想凑这个热闹,00:23:06.270,00:23:07.930,I don't want to join in the bustle.
00:23:07.210,00:23:09.880,奴才是想要是把踏青游春,00:23:08.310,00:23:11.400,I was thinking if we put the trip together with
00:23:10.300,00:23:12.630,和祈福敬香搁到一块,00:23:11.400,00:23:13.939,"the blessing and the incense offering,"
00:23:13.220,00:23:14.760,倒是有个地方最合适,00:23:14.320,00:23:16.110,I could suggest a suitable place.
00:23:15.350,00:23:17.050,臣妾倒是记得小时候,00:23:16.450,00:23:18.410,"Your Majesty, I remember when I was little,"
00:23:17.310,00:23:20.020,去斗爱云峰赏春风景秀美,00:23:18.410,00:23:21.120,the spring view on Peak Lingyun was lushly beautiful.
00:23:20.600,00:23:22.890,再去甘露寺烧香祈福,,,
00:23:23.440,00:23:25.480,一日时间倒也是正好,00:23:21.700,00:23:24.899,"And then Your Majesty could visit the Temple of Pure Dew
to pray and offer incense."
00:23:26.070,00:23:27.560,还是惠嫔娘娘知道,00:23:25.168,00:23:26.830,That would be only a one day trip.
00:23:27.820,00:23:29.350,奴才正想提这个地方呢,00:23:27.170,00:23:28.920,"Yes exactly, Your Highness."
00:23:29.780,00:23:31.640,现今甘露寺春色正美,00:23:28.920,00:23:30.700,I was just about to mention that place.
,,,00:23:30.700,00:23:33.050,"This is the best time for spring scenery
at the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:23:31.950,00:23:34.940,也不失是一个清静散心的好地方,00:23:33.050,00:23:35.861,And it's a quiet place for a leisurely walk.
00:23:35.330,00:23:37.530,再加上甘露寺又是皇家的地方,00:23:36.206,00:23:38.630,"Since the temple belongs to the Imperial Family,"
00:23:37.870,00:23:38.830,闲人少啊,,,
00:23:39.710,00:23:40.790,甘露寺,00:23:38.970,00:23:40.264,there will be fewer people.
,,,00:23:40.810,00:23:42.159,The Temple of Pure Dew.
00:23:41.830,00:23:42.620,奴才知道,00:23:42.720,00:23:43.689,I understand
00:23:42.830,00:23:44.790,甘露寺有皇上不想见的人,00:23:43.689,00:23:45.816,there's someone Your Majesty doesn't want to see.
00:23:45.130,00:23:47.160,反正咱们只是到那儿去敬香嘛,00:23:46.006,00:23:47.961,We are just offering incense there.
00:23:47.460,00:23:48.200,又不见她,,,
00:23:48.510,00:23:49.840,再加上如今出宫,00:23:47.961,00:23:49.341,We don't need to see her.
00:23:50.130,00:23:52.620,正好可以为太后的病情祈福,00:23:49.341,00:23:53.280,"Also, we can pray for Her Majesty
the Empress Dowager's health at the temple."
00:23:53.010,00:23:54.090,更显得诚意些,00:23:53.280,00:23:55.190,It will show more sincerity.
00:23:54.510,00:23:55.470,要是时辰早,00:23:55.610,00:23:56.862,"If it's still early,"
00:23:55.930,00:23:59.420,奴才再陪皇上去凌云峰踏春去,00:23:57.030,00:24:00.520,I will accompany Your Majesty for a walk at Peak Lingyun.
00:24:01.100,00:24:04.940,二月二百姓竞相出游,00:24:02.200,00:24:06.249,"Since the people are all going out
on the second day of the second month..."
00:24:06.770,00:24:07.560,也好吧,00:24:07.646,00:24:09.077,Might as well.
00:24:08.400,00:24:12.770,朕就正好去看看世情百态,00:24:09.276,00:24:13.915,"I will take the opportunity to see
the different facets of people's lives."
00:24:14.320,00:24:16.310,嘛奴才这就去办,00:24:15.420,00:24:17.760,"Yes, Your Majesty, I will arrange it right away."
00:24:17.790,00:24:18.570,皇阿玛好,00:24:18.352,00:24:20.000,Imperial Father.
00:24:30.210,00:24:30.950,奴婢听说,,,
00:24:31.420,00:24:32.290,二月二那日,,,
00:24:32.590,00:24:34.250,皇上要出宫为太后祈福,00:24:31.320,00:24:33.762,"Your Highness, I heard that on the
second day of the second month,"
00:24:35.090,00:24:37.010,出宫去哪儿啊,00:24:33.762,00:24:35.896,"His Majesty is going out to
pray for the Empress Dowager."
00:24:37.220,00:24:37.880,去甘露寺,00:24:36.190,00:24:38.110,Out of the palace? To where?
00:24:39.010,00:24:39.970,不能去呀,00:24:38.110,00:24:39.290,The Temple of Pure Dew.
00:24:40.770,00:24:41.970,奴婢已经打听过了,00:24:40.110,00:24:41.294,He shouldn't...
00:24:42.430,00:24:43.510,甄嬛患了肺痨,00:24:41.870,00:24:43.070,I have asked around.
00:24:43.890,00:24:44.880,已被赶去凌云峰,00:24:43.530,00:24:45.628,"Zhen Huan caught tuberculosis and
was evicted to Peak Lingyun."
00:24:45.270,00:24:46.310,并不在甘露寺,00:24:46.129,00:24:47.748,She's not at the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:24:48.570,00:24:51.270,那就好叫人看着点,00:24:49.401,00:24:50.799,That's good then.
,,,00:24:50.966,00:24:52.697,Tell them to keep an eye out
00:24:51.740,00:24:54.100,让皇上早去早回,00:24:52.697,00:24:55.132,and make sure His Majesty returns early.
00:24:54.450,00:24:55.030,是,00:24:55.550,00:24:56.313,Yes.
00:24:58.120,00:24:59.400,苏培盛也算用心,00:24:59.220,00:25:00.709,Su Peisheng is very thoughtful.
00:25:01.000,00:25:02.080,只怕这些衣裳,,,
00:25:02.450,00:25:04.320,都是回去后连夜叫绣工,,,
00:25:04.670,00:25:06.000,按照我的尺寸给赶出来的,00:25:02.100,00:25:07.217,"I assume these clothes were rushed
and completed overnight in my size."
00:25:08.790,00:25:10.030,这些衣料是给你的,00:25:09.666,00:25:11.367,These satin pieces are for you.
00:25:11.460,00:25:13.170,你看连颜色花样,00:25:12.291,00:25:14.180, Look at these colors and patterns -
00:25:13.670,00:25:15.130,都是你素日里喜欢的,00:25:14.770,00:25:16.230,They are what you usually like.
00:25:16.220,00:25:20.010,也就如此吧好不好的都是命,00:25:17.319,00:25:18.476,"Yes, they are,"
,,,00:25:19.597,00:25:21.871,"but good or bad, this is my fate."
00:25:21.390,00:25:22.000,什么,00:25:22.490,00:25:23.434,What?
00:25:24.520,00:25:25.510,奴婢喜欢,00:25:25.620,00:25:26.777,"I like them, Mistress."
00:25:27.810,00:25:29.390,苏培盛府里的总管说,,,
00:25:29.820,00:25:30.650,要娘子盛装,00:25:28.910,00:25:31.880,"Su Peisheng's head attendant said
you should dress up, Mistress."
00:25:31.230,00:25:34.020,送这些东西怕也是这个意思,00:25:32.330,00:25:35.120,These gifts indicate it.
00:25:35.570,00:25:37.110,苏培盛的意思我知道,00:25:36.670,00:25:38.460,I understand Su Peisheng's message.
00:25:37.990,00:25:39.320,他是希望我盛装,,,
00:25:39.780,00:25:41.240,一举赢得皇上的心,00:25:39.090,00:25:42.349,"He wants me to be well-dressed, to
immediately win over His Majesty's heart."
00:25:42.410,00:25:45.280,只是这样未免落了刻意,00:25:43.510,00:25:46.380,But this would appear to be deliberate.
00:25:46.830,00:25:48.990,可是那日听苏培盛说起,,,
00:25:49.380,00:25:50.370,皇上对娘娘的心意,00:25:47.930,00:25:51.570,"The other day, when Su Peisheng spoke about
how much His Majesty cares about you, Mistress,"
00:25:51.130,00:25:53.410,也真是闻者伤心哪,00:25:51.961,00:25:54.241,it was really touching.
00:25:55.760,00:25:57.340,当真是情深一片吗,00:25:56.860,00:25:58.565,Is it really deep affection?
00:25:59.640,00:26:01.500,这样总把别人当影子的人,00:26:00.740,00:26:03.484,The one who takes a person as the shadow of another
00:26:02.470,00:26:03.960,伤了自己又伤了别人,00:26:03.484,00:26:05.276,only hurts himself and others.
00:26:06.060,00:26:07.300,皇上待人凉薄,00:26:07.160,00:26:09.079,His Majesty treats everyone with a cold heart.
00:26:08.810,00:26:10.970,凉薄之人施舍的所谓真情,00:26:09.686,00:26:12.484,"The so-called care and affection
bestowed by a cold-hearted person..."
00:26:12.190,00:26:13.560,槿汐 你会感动吗,00:26:13.290,00:26:14.952,"Jinxi, could you be touched by that?"
00:26:15.070,00:26:16.810,可是苏培盛说的那一刹那,00:26:16.170,00:26:18.366,"But the moment Su Peisheng mentioned it,"
00:26:17.610,00:26:19.440,奴婢见娘子的眉心微动,00:26:18.658,00:26:20.983,I noticed your eyebrow moving slightly.
00:26:20.660,00:26:22.070,难道娘子内心里,00:26:21.760,00:26:23.170,"Mistress, have any feelings of affection"
00:26:23.120,00:26:24.820,真的没有转过什么念头吗,00:26:24.220,00:26:25.920,crossed your mind?
00:26:28.870,00:26:30.660,先把你伤得体无完肤,00:26:29.970,00:26:31.760,Isn't it pointless
00:26:31.880,00:26:33.990,再施一点无济于事的药物,,,
00:26:35.170,00:26:36.380,又有什么意思,00:26:32.980,00:26:37.480,"to accept a feeble medicine
when every inch of me has been injured?"
00:26:38.180,00:26:39.510,无论有没有意思,00:26:39.280,00:26:41.069,"Pointless or not,"
00:26:40.220,00:26:41.710,只消皇上有这份心,00:26:41.320,00:26:43.185,"as long as His Majesty has this feeling,"
00:26:43.010,00:26:44.550,我们就事半功倍了,00:26:43.841,00:26:45.732,we can succeed with half the effort.
00:26:51.610,00:26:53.470,皇上请用茶,00:26:52.710,00:26:54.820,"Your Majesty, please have some tea."
00:27:00.280,00:27:02.940,宫里来的莞嫔现下何处,00:27:01.156,00:27:04.040,Where is Concubine Sourire from the palace?
00:27:03.450,00:27:04.410,回皇上话,,,
00:27:04.700,00:27:06.610,现下莞嫔因病,00:27:04.550,00:27:05.800,"Your Majesty,"
00:27:06.870,00:27:09.280,已搬至凌云峰的禅房住着,00:27:05.800,00:27:10.760,"Concubine Sourire has moved to the living quarters
at Peak Lingyun due to her illness."
00:27:10.870,00:27:11.660,她病了,00:27:11.970,00:27:13.187,She's sick...?
00:27:12.500,00:27:14.330,病了多久有无大碍,00:27:13.600,00:27:15.645,For how long?  How serious?
00:27:15.550,00:27:19.410,莞嫔应该应该已经见好了,00:27:16.650,00:27:18.258,I guess...
,,,00:27:18.717,00:27:20.593,Concubine Sourire should be better now.
00:27:19.840,00:27:22.930,岂有此理什么叫应该,00:27:20.940,00:27:22.131,Ridiculous!
00:27:23.800,00:27:25.970,你是住持难道连这都不清楚吗,00:27:22.506,00:27:24.676,"What do you mean by ""should be better now""?"
00:27:27.930,00:27:28.670,你倒说说,00:27:24.676,00:27:27.216,You are the abbess. How can you not know?
00:27:30.100,00:27:31.390,来的时候好好的,00:27:28.909,00:27:30.000,"Tell me,"
00:27:32.560,00:27:33.470,怎么就病了呢,00:27:30.976,00:27:34.471,"How is it that she arrived healthy,
but fell sick here?"
00:27:33.770,00:27:34.390,这,,,
00:27:34.690,00:27:35.430,皇上恕罪,00:27:34.720,00:27:35.490,I...
00:27:36.110,00:27:38.350,莞嫔来到小寺静修佛法,00:27:35.490,00:27:36.970,We beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:27:38.860,00:27:40.770,是小寺上下的无上荣耀,00:27:37.210,00:27:41.840,"It is our greatest honor to have
Concubine Sourire here to practice Buddhism."
00:27:40.950,00:27:41.560,是,00:27:41.840,00:27:42.656,Yes.
00:27:41.780,00:27:44.770,小寺上下无人不尊她敬她,00:27:42.656,00:27:45.913,Everyone in the temple respects and admires her
00:27:45.160,00:27:46.320,不敢有一丝的怠慢,00:27:45.913,00:27:47.440,without the slightest insolence!
00:27:47.080,00:27:49.990,只是莞嫔心怀大慈大仁之心,00:27:47.911,00:27:51.336,"But Concubine Sourire harbors Buddha's
great compassion and benevolence."
00:27:50.460,00:27:51.740,不愿叨扰旁人,,,
00:27:52.170,00:27:54.080,事事皆要亲力亲为,00:27:51.336,00:27:55.205,"She refused to trouble others
and insisted on doing everything by herself."
00:27:55.040,00:27:57.130,还自请为寺里的老弱姑子,,,
00:27:57.460,00:27:59.200,洗洗衣物砍柴挑水,00:27:55.916,00:28:00.280,"She helped the senior and weak nuns
wash clothes, chop wood and carry water."
00:27:59.420,00:28:00.330,是 是,00:28:00.280,00:28:01.277,Yes. Yes.
00:28:00.670,00:28:02.510,莞嫔的身子本来不好,00:28:01.277,00:28:03.617,"Concubine Sourire was not in very good health,"
00:28:02.930,00:28:05.540,一日不堪风寒便病倒了,00:28:03.806,00:28:06.583,and one day she didn't withstand the cold and fell ill.
00:28:05.760,00:28:06.380,是,00:28:06.583,00:28:07.480,Indeed.
00:28:10.850,00:28:14.840,她竟浣洗衣物 砍柴挑水,00:28:11.950,00:28:15.671,"You say she washed clothes, chopped wood and carried water?"
00:28:15.060,00:28:16.220,是 是,,,
00:28:16.650,00:28:17.810,她现在怎么样了,00:28:15.891,00:28:17.134,Yes. Yes.
00:28:18.440,00:28:19.230,回皇上,00:28:17.526,00:28:19.032,How is she now?
00:28:19.990,00:28:21.190,自打莞嫔病后,00:28:19.540,00:28:20.664,"Your Majesty,"
00:28:21.530,00:28:23.520,小寺便独独辟了禅房,00:28:20.913,00:28:25.760,"we provided Concubine Sourire separate
living quarters for her recovery."
00:28:23.820,00:28:24.730,让她安心休养,,,
00:28:25.410,00:28:28.070,想来如今应已大好,00:28:26.286,00:28:29.305,I believe she should have recovered now.
00:28:28.620,00:28:29.320,是,00:28:29.720,00:28:30.511,Yes.
00:28:31.330,00:28:34.200,那你引朕去禅房探望吧,00:28:32.430,00:28:35.300,Lead me to the living quarters.
00:28:34.420,00:28:35.330,是,00:28:35.520,00:28:36.473,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:28:39.840,00:28:41.330,小姐用茉莉水梳头,00:28:40.716,00:28:43.099,"My Lady, combing your hair with jasmine water"
00:28:42.220,00:28:43.920,满头都是淡淡的茉莉香,00:28:43.266,00:28:45.552,leaves every strand a light scent of jasmine flowers.
00:28:45.800,00:28:46.670,真是好闻,00:28:46.900,00:28:48.020,It smells really good.
00:28:48.260,00:28:52.930,希望这淡淡的花香不会让人讨厌,00:28:49.360,00:28:51.530,I hope this light floral scent
,,,00:28:52.948,00:28:54.697,won't displease anyone.
00:28:56.860,00:28:59.600,小姐我怕,00:28:57.691,00:29:00.531,"My Lady, I'm scared..."
00:29:01.650,00:29:03.270,我既怕小姐今日不成功,00:29:02.436,00:29:04.723,I'm worried that you won't succeed today...
00:29:04.360,00:29:05.520,又怕是成功了,00:29:05.236,00:29:06.707,"And if you succeed,"
00:29:06.740,00:29:09.450,以后的路会更险更难走,00:29:07.885,00:29:10.522,I'm afraid the road ahead will be even more perilous.
00:29:11.160,00:29:12.370,除了这条路,00:29:12.260,00:29:13.853,But I don't have
00:29:14.580,00:29:15.740,我没有路可以走,,,
00:29:17.420,00:29:18.950,小姐身穿这身佛衣,00:29:15.562,00:29:18.049,any other path in front of me.
00:29:19.880,00:29:21.290,未免也太素了一些吧,00:29:18.549,00:29:22.181,"My Lady, your monastic robe looks very plain and modest."
00:29:22.300,00:29:23.660,小姐既然下了心思,,,
00:29:24.630,00:29:26.290,也总该细心打扮才是,00:29:23.131,00:29:27.216,Why not dress more nicely since you've made up your mind?
00:29:27.510,00:29:28.590,皇上在宫里,,,
00:29:29.720,00:29:31.840,浓艳素雅都看得多了,00:29:28.610,00:29:32.920,"In the palace, His Majesty has seen every color,
both bright and subdued."
00:29:33.680,00:29:35.640,我便是要这样洁净到底,00:29:34.765,00:29:37.336,I will remain pure and natural.
00:29:38.440,00:29:39.390,出居修行,,,
00:29:40.190,00:29:41.650,任何修饰在这山中,00:29:39.271,00:29:41.000,"After all, we are practicing Buddhism."
00:29:42.030,00:29:42.980,都显得会突兀些,00:29:41.066,00:29:44.000,Any adornment would seem inappropriate in the mountain.
00:29:43.570,00:29:45.350,不如这样正正好,00:29:44.446,00:29:46.309,This is just right.
00:30:22.070,00:30:23.560,是皇上的仪仗来了,00:30:23.170,00:30:24.952,It's His Majesty's procession.
00:30:25.940,00:30:27.430,可真是显赫得不得了,00:30:27.040,00:30:28.530,How extravagant.
00:31:16.410,00:31:17.570,南无阿弥陀佛,00:31:17.510,00:31:18.920,Namo Amitābha.
00:31:18.250,00:31:19.330,南无阿弥陀佛,00:31:19.350,00:31:20.680,Namo Amitābha.
00:31:24.670,00:31:27.290,娘子昨晚又没睡好 不如,00:31:25.770,00:31:27.348,"Mistress, you didn't sleep well again last night."
00:31:29.220,00:31:29.960,皇上,00:31:27.932,00:31:28.974,How about ...
,,,00:31:30.320,00:31:31.310,Your Majesty!
00:31:30.760,00:31:35.050,皇上 皇上怎么会来这儿,00:31:31.860,00:31:33.131,His Majesty?
00:31:36.520,00:31:38.260,娘子 真的是皇上,00:31:34.799,00:31:36.650,How could His Majesty be here...
00:31:38.560,00:31:39.470,奴婢没有骗您,00:31:37.567,00:31:40.640,"Mistress, it's really His Majesty.
I did not lie to you!"
00:31:49.610,00:31:50.270,嬛嬛,00:31:50.710,00:31:51.919,Huan Huan...
00:31:52.910,00:31:54.520,方才甘露寺的姑子说,00:31:53.965,00:31:55.924,I just now heard from the nuns
00:31:55.410,00:31:57.650,莞嫔是因病才搬到这里住着,00:31:56.510,00:31:58.615,that Concubine Sourire moved here due to illness
00:31:58.040,00:31:59.450,现下已经大好了,00:31:58.871,00:32:00.576,but should have recovered by now.
00:31:59.790,00:32:01.950,怎么朕瞧着还是病怃怃的,00:32:00.576,00:32:02.826,Why do you still look unwell to me?
00:32:02.170,00:32:02.700,皇上,,,
00:32:03.080,00:32:03.660,奴才也是头一回,,,
00:32:04.040,00:32:05.000,跟着皇上到这儿来,00:32:03.046,00:32:06.120,"Your Majesty, it's also my first time to visit here."
00:32:05.500,00:32:07.040,怎么会知道莫愁师太,00:32:06.600,00:32:08.307,I don't know why Prioress Mochou...
00:32:07.880,00:32:09.120,莞嫔还病着呢,00:32:08.980,00:32:10.470,Concubine Sourire is still ill.
00:32:10.510,00:32:11.540,你方才说什么,,,
00:32:12.220,00:32:13.550,莞嫔昨晚又没睡好,00:32:11.610,00:32:12.849,What did you say just now?
00:32:13.890,00:32:14.800,什么叫又没睡好,00:32:13.320,00:32:16.054,"Concubine Sourire didn't sleep well again?
Why did you say ""again""?"
00:32:15.550,00:32:16.460,回皇上的话,00:32:16.650,00:32:17.852,"Your Majesty,"
00:32:17.430,00:32:19.670,我们娘子当初被人硬说成是肺痨,,,
00:32:19.980,00:32:20.810,赶出了甘露寺,00:32:18.530,00:32:21.891,"Mistress was relocated because
they insisted she had tuberculosis."
00:32:21.350,00:32:22.470,那冰天雪地的,00:32:22.450,00:32:24.290,We left on a frozen and snowy day.
00:32:23.190,00:32:25.470,娘子身子又弱病就更重了,00:32:24.290,00:32:26.570,"Mistress was weak, and her illness worsened."
00:32:26.310,00:32:28.900,其实这病压根就不是什么肺痨,00:32:27.410,00:32:30.167,"In reality, it wasn't tuberculosis at all."
00:32:29.730,00:32:31.650,而是我们娘子自生育之后,,,
00:32:31.950,00:32:32.980,月子没有调养好,00:32:30.830,00:32:33.844,"It's because My Lady wasn't nursed well
in the first month after giving birth."
00:32:33.320,00:32:34.150,一直咳嗽着,,,
00:32:34.530,00:32:35.770,落下的病根而已,00:32:33.844,00:32:35.361,She was persistently coughing.
00:32:37.030,00:32:39.620,本来还说吃着药到了春天,00:32:35.361,00:32:37.143,That's how the chronic symptoms developed.
00:32:40.040,00:32:41.240,这病也能渐渐好起来,00:32:38.240,00:32:42.265,"We thought taking medicine would help
cure her illness in the spring."
00:32:42.000,00:32:43.490,可是娘子自出宫之后,00:32:42.876,00:32:44.533,"But since leaving the palace,"
00:32:43.830,00:32:45.570,就一直惦记着皇上和公主,00:32:44.706,00:32:47.047,Mistress missed Your Majesty and the Princess so much.
00:32:46.420,00:32:48.580,神情恍惚夜夜睡不好,00:32:47.520,00:32:49.805,"She was often so distracted she couldn't sleep well,"
00:32:49.210,00:32:51.000,才拖着一直没有痊愈,00:32:50.310,00:32:52.392,the result was that she never fully recovered.
00:34:07.290,00:34:08.370,叫他们全部退后,,,
00:34:08.880,00:34:10.040,退后 退后 退后,00:34:08.390,00:34:09.595,Ask them all to back off.
00:34:10.290,00:34:11.080,都到下面守着,00:34:09.980,00:34:11.140,Stay out! Out!
00:34:11.750,00:34:13.240,一只苍蝇都不准放上来,00:34:11.140,00:34:12.504,You all will wait down there.
00:34:14.010,00:34:14.590,还有,00:34:12.850,00:34:14.560,Not even a fly is allowed to pass by!
00:34:17.630,00:34:19.550,今天的事谁要是说出去,00:34:14.829,00:34:16.609,"And listen,"
00:34:20.050,00:34:21.540,就是不要自个儿的脑袋了,00:34:18.730,00:34:20.650,"if anyone dares to speak a word,"
00:34:22.060,00:34:22.640,明白了吗,00:34:21.150,00:34:22.890,they are forsaking their own head!
00:34:23.890,00:34:24.300,明白了,00:34:23.160,00:34:24.199,Is that understood?
00:34:24.850,00:34:25.180,下去,,,
00:34:25.350,00:34:25.960,快走,00:34:24.990,00:34:25.782,Yes.
,,,00:34:25.950,00:34:27.076,"- You may go.
- Go, quickly."
00:34:27.390,00:34:28.260,皇上他,00:34:28.490,00:34:29.652,His Majesty...
00:34:29.190,00:34:31.430,皇上有娘娘伺候着 罗嗦什么,00:34:30.290,00:34:32.697,His Majesty is accompanied by Her Highness. Leave now!
00:34:33.020,00:34:33.980,是是是,00:34:34.120,00:34:35.205,"Yes, yes."
00:34:37.820,00:34:40.610,嬛嬛朕来了朕来了,00:34:38.920,00:34:41.710,"Huan Huan, I’m here. I’m here."
00:34:42.870,00:34:46.830,四郎我等了你这么久,00:34:43.970,00:34:45.195,Si Lang.
,,,00:34:46.613,00:34:49.348,I have been waiting for you for so long.
00:34:50.790,00:34:52.330,你让朕心痛,00:34:51.890,00:34:53.513,You make my heart hurt.
00:34:55.460,00:34:56.290,四郎,00:34:56.560,00:34:57.557,Si Lang.
00:35:01.090,00:35:01.750,怎么样,,,
00:35:03.430,00:35:04.550,水到渠成,00:35:02.190,00:35:03.286,How is this going?
00:35:05.560,00:35:07.640,只是不想能这么顺利,00:35:04.530,00:35:06.477,"“Once the canal is built, the river will flow.”"
00:35:08.940,00:35:10.520,两下里都是有情的,00:35:06.660,00:35:09.089,I didn't expect it to go so smoothly.
00:35:10.980,00:35:12.340,这不是一拍即合吗,00:35:10.040,00:35:12.078,They both have feelings for each other.
00:35:13.360,00:35:14.270,鳘好吧,00:35:12.078,00:35:13.918,"""The drum beats a rhythm and the instruments fit in."""
00:35:15.070,00:35:15.810,走吧,00:35:14.281,00:35:15.687,Just wait for the happy result!
,,,00:35:15.946,00:35:16.936,Let’s go.
00:35:50.940,00:35:51.890,为什么哭啊,00:35:51.861,00:35:53.071,Why are you crying?
00:35:55.650,00:35:59.140,人人都当嬛嬛当年任性离宫,00:35:56.750,00:36:02.200,"Everyone said that I was incorrigibly wrong
when I insisted on leaving the palace."
00:35:59.860,00:36:01.100,错到无可救药,,,
00:36:02.450,00:36:03.810,唯有嬛嬛自己知道,00:36:03.550,00:36:05.449,"Only I knew then,"
00:36:04.990,00:36:06.450,也是到了今日才知道,00:36:06.116,00:36:07.847,"and I still know now,"
00:36:07.790,00:36:11.400,当日这么做当真是半分错也没有,00:36:08.890,00:36:09.794,there was ...
,,,00:36:10.915,00:36:14.025,nothing wrong with my decision that day.
00:36:17.460,00:36:18.830,从前嬛嬛总以为,00:36:18.560,00:36:20.469,I used to think Si Lang
00:36:19.670,00:36:21.880,四郎对我是半分情意也没有了,00:36:20.918,00:36:23.409,had lost all affection for me.
00:36:24.220,00:36:26.010,不过因为我是胧月的生母,00:36:25.320,00:36:27.334,And that you asked me to stay in the palace
00:36:27.100,00:36:29.550,又长得和纯元皇后有几分相似,00:36:28.246,00:36:30.869,"only because I bear some resemblance to Empress Première,"
00:36:30.180,00:36:31.340,才要我留在宫中,00:36:31.308,00:36:33.175,and because I gave birth to Longyue.
00:36:33.400,00:36:34.930,嬛嬛这样倾慕四郎,00:36:34.500,00:36:36.322,"I adore you so much, Si Lang."
00:36:36.650,00:36:39.890,当初当真是被那句,00:36:37.750,00:36:41.256,I was really hurt when you wrote to Empress Première
00:36:40.280,00:36:41.560,莞莞类卿给伤着了,00:36:41.256,00:36:43.130,“Sourire resembles you.”
00:36:42.360,00:36:44.350,现在还说这些做什么呢,00:36:43.460,00:36:45.617,Why would you talk about this now?
00:36:45.070,00:36:45.780,四郎,00:36:45.991,00:36:46.950,Si Lang.
00:36:47.280,00:36:48.440,出宫这些年,,,
00:36:49.490,00:36:51.160,嬛嬛无时无刻不在想,00:36:48.380,00:36:52.520,I have been thinking continuously since I left the palace:
00:36:52.460,00:36:54.370,若四郎对我还有一分真心,00:36:53.631,00:36:55.930,"If Si Lang still has any true affection towards me,"
00:36:55.920,00:36:58.580,不只要有那么一点点,00:36:57.020,00:37:00.179,"no, even if the slightest trace of it,"
00:36:59.840,00:37:01.250,嬛嬛便死而无憾,00:37:00.761,00:37:02.400,I could die without regret.
00:37:04.050,00:37:06.340,如今嬛嬛离开四郎已经三年,00:37:04.971,00:37:07.518,"I have been away for three years now, Si Lang."
00:37:07.300,00:37:08.380,三年未见,00:37:08.236,00:37:10.000,"Although we haven't seen each other for three years,"
00:37:09.560,00:37:11.420,四郎还一直惦记着嬛嬛,00:37:10.570,00:37:12.371,"Si Lang, you still have me on your mind."
00:37:12.980,00:37:14.310,刚才听皇上说,,,
00:37:15.350,00:37:16.680,嬛嬛因病别居,00:37:14.080,00:37:17.817,When Your Majesty said you came to Peak Lingyun
00:37:17.770,00:37:19.890,就从甘露寺赶到凌云峰来探望,00:37:18.646,00:37:21.280, because you heard I was ill and relocated...
00:37:22.690,00:37:24.180,嬛嬛只要知道四郎,,,
00:37:24.900,00:37:26.490,对我还有那么一点真心,00:37:23.790,00:37:27.560,"As long as I know that Si Lang still has a sincere heart for me,"
00:37:27.950,00:37:30.570,这三年的别离又有何遗憾,00:37:28.871,00:37:31.687,there will be no regret over these three years apart.
00:37:32.620,00:37:33.910,若是早能知道,00:37:33.720,00:37:35.404,I would have given ten years off my life
00:37:35.120,00:37:38.410,嬛嬛宁愿折寿十年,00:37:36.220,00:37:39.510,if only I could have known sooner.
00:37:39.290,00:37:40.200,不许胡说,00:37:40.211,00:37:41.857,I don't allow you to say that.
00:37:43.920,00:37:44.630,嬛嬛,,,
00:37:46.130,00:37:47.470,甘露寺三年,00:37:45.020,00:37:46.064,Huan Huan.
00:37:48.140,00:37:49.970,你的性子柔婉了不少,00:37:47.051,00:37:51.205,"Three years at the Temple of Pure Dew
has softened your temperament a lot."
00:37:51.680,00:37:54.840,若非当初你这般任性意气用事,00:37:52.601,00:37:55.761,"If you weren’t so headstrong at the time,
acting on your emotions,"
00:37:55.600,00:37:58.560,朕又怎么会舍得让你出宫,00:37:56.521,00:38:00.000, how could I have had the heart to let you leave the palace?
00:38:00.730,00:38:02.220,你生下胧月三天,00:38:01.651,00:38:03.680,"Three days after you gave birth to Longyue,"
00:38:03.150,00:38:04.770,朕废去了你的名位,00:38:04.250,00:38:06.288,I abolished your rank and title
00:38:06.150,00:38:07.820,让你好好思过,00:38:07.250,00:38:09.254,so you could reflect on your mistakes.
00:38:09.070,00:38:10.440,若你的名位还在,00:38:10.170,00:38:11.973,"Had you held your rank and title,"
00:38:11.330,00:38:13.940,又怎么会知道出宫以后的苦楚,00:38:12.430,00:38:15.278,"how would you have experienced the
hardship of life outside the palace?"
00:38:15.040,00:38:16.150,什么都不要紧,00:38:16.140,00:38:17.876,None of that matters now.
00:38:17.290,00:38:18.950,嬛嬛只要四郎在这里,00:38:18.390,00:38:20.050,I just want Si Lang here.
00:38:21.130,00:38:22.080,四郎,00:38:22.230,00:38:23.430,Si Lang.
00:38:24.210,00:38:25.120,我多怕一生一世,,,
00:38:25.420,00:38:26.540,都再也见不到你了,00:38:25.040,00:38:28.209,I was afraid I would never see you again in my life.
00:38:28.510,00:38:29.420,还有胧月,00:38:29.610,00:38:31.284,"And Longyue,"
00:38:31.600,00:38:32.550,我们的胧月,00:38:32.577,00:38:34.345,our Longyue...
00:38:34.470,00:38:35.550,胧月很好,00:38:35.477,00:38:37.037,Longyue has grown up very well.
00:38:36.310,00:38:38.140,你不知道她有多乖巧可爱,00:38:37.246,00:38:39.981,"You have no idea how adorable she is,"
00:38:39.310,00:38:41.100,敬妃疼得不得了,00:38:40.410,00:38:42.758,and how much Consort Estime adores her.
00:38:41.940,00:38:44.930,只可惜朕不能带她出来给你看,00:38:43.040,00:38:46.344,It's unfortunate that I can't bring her here to visit you.
00:38:46.110,00:38:47.520,嬛嬛久病缠身,00:38:47.210,00:38:49.280,I've been plagued by illness.
00:38:48.660,00:38:50.270,在甘露寺备受苦楚,00:38:49.760,00:38:51.908,The hardships I have endured here
00:38:51.160,00:38:53.490,何尝不是当年任性倔强的报应,00:38:52.260,00:38:54.840,are karmic retribution for my willful acts in the past.
00:38:54.990,00:38:56.730,嬛嬛虽然离开了紫禁城,00:38:56.090,00:38:58.382,"Although I have left the Forbidden City,"
00:38:57.540,00:38:58.570,可心中惦记的,,,
00:38:59.290,00:39:00.870,无一不是紫禁城中的人,00:38:58.640,00:39:00.000,all those I have in my heart
,,,00:39:00.493,00:39:02.854,reside in the Forbidden City.
00:39:02.630,00:39:04.040,芳若来探望嬛嬛,00:39:03.730,00:39:05.641,"Whenever Madam Orchid comes to visit me,"
00:39:05.260,00:39:07.340,我甚至都不敢问四郎的近况,00:39:06.360,00:39:08.572,I don't even have the courage to ask about Si Lang.
00:39:08.260,00:39:09.590,就怕芳若会告诉我,,,
00:39:10.340,00:39:11.920,四郎已有新人在侧,00:39:09.360,00:39:11.592,I'm afraid she will tell me
00:39:12.350,00:39:13.840,已经全然忘了嬛嬛,00:39:11.592,00:39:13.450,you have new concubines by your side
,,,00:39:13.450,00:39:15.687,and have completely forgotten about me.
00:39:15.970,00:39:18.180,嬛嬛只能每日诵经百遍,00:39:17.070,00:39:19.614,"Every day, I can only chant the sutra a hundred times,"
00:39:19.850,00:39:22.850,祈求四郎与胧月安康长乐,00:39:20.939,00:39:24.188,praying for your and Longyue's happiness and good health.
00:39:26.110,00:39:27.690,如今能与四郎重会,00:39:27.210,00:39:29.808,It is already a blessing of my entire life
00:39:29.070,00:39:30.860,已是嬛嬛毕生的福气了,00:39:30.225,00:39:32.423,for me to see my Si Lang again.
00:39:33.580,00:39:35.490,过去的事你已经受了教训,00:39:34.680,00:39:36.994,You have already learned your lesson.
00:39:37.500,00:39:40.110,若非你离宫三年,00:39:38.421,00:39:41.435,"If you hadn't been away for three years,"
00:39:41.080,00:39:44.830,朕怎么会知道竟会对你如此牵挂,00:39:42.180,00:39:46.080,I would have never known how much I would yearn for you.
00:39:46.050,00:39:47.500,四郎情深意重,00:39:47.150,00:39:49.026,"Si Lang, your affection is deep and profound."
00:39:48.670,00:39:51.710,嬛嬛越发无地自容了,00:39:49.564,00:39:51.327,It makes me so ashamed;
,,,00:39:51.515,00:39:54.073,No place I could stand would tolerate my existence.
00:39:53.970,00:39:54.930,你可知道,00:39:54.846,00:39:56.587,Did you know
00:39:55.760,00:39:57.750,这些年宫里发生了多少事,00:39:56.879,00:39:59.240,how much has happened in the palace these years?
00:39:58.770,00:40:00.970,朕连个说贴心话的人都没有,00:39:59.691,00:40:02.340,I don't have anyone I can speak my heart with.
00:40:06.150,00:40:07.180,你走了以后,00:40:07.250,00:40:08.761,"After you left,"
00:40:09.150,00:40:10.690,朕去过一次碎玉轩,00:40:10.000,00:40:12.303,I visited the Palace of Pearl Jade once.
00:40:12.410,00:40:13.610,除了长相思,,,
00:40:14.660,00:40:15.770,你什么都没带走,00:40:13.498,00:40:17.377,"Except for Endless Longing, the Zither,
you didn't take anything else with you."
00:40:17.330,00:40:21.240,就连这枚簪子也放在了梳粕台上,00:40:18.430,00:40:22.564,You even left this hairpin on the dresser.
00:40:22.080,00:40:25.950,长相思是当年皇上亲手所赐,00:40:23.180,00:40:27.050,"Endless Longing was given to me personally
by Your Majesty."
00:40:27.460,00:40:28.370,除了相思,,,
00:40:29.340,00:40:30.420,别的身外之物,00:40:28.560,00:40:30.375,"Aside from my feelings of longing,"
,,,00:40:30.552,00:40:31.567,everything else
00:40:31.470,00:40:33.580,嬛嬛又有什么不可以舍弃的呢,00:40:32.419,00:40:34.814,was a worldly possession I could leave behind.
00:40:35.010,00:40:35.670,嬛嬛,00:40:35.886,00:40:36.967,Huan Huan.
00:40:36.890,00:40:39.600,当初朕曾命你落饰出家,00:40:37.990,00:40:40.992,I ordered you to cease ornamentation and become a nun.
00:40:40.390,00:40:43.800,如今为了朕再度妆饰吧,00:40:41.490,00:40:45.067,"Today, would you be willing to adorn yourself for me again?"
00:40:46.690,00:40:48.480,四郎说什么嬛嬛都愿意,00:40:47.790,00:40:50.209,"Si Lang, I am willing to do anything you wish."
00:40:49.690,00:40:50.930,只是有一事相求,00:40:50.790,00:40:52.777,I only have one request.
00:40:52.400,00:40:53.730,嬛嬛是废妃之身,00:40:53.500,00:40:55.529,I am already a banished concubine.
00:40:54.860,00:40:57.070,能再侍奉皇上身边已是万幸,00:40:55.960,00:40:58.641,"It is my greatest fortune to be able
to serve Your Majesty again."
00:40:58.450,00:41:00.320,实在不愿宫中的诸位嫔妃,,,
00:41:01.040,00:41:02.900,因为今日之事再起争端,00:40:59.550,00:41:04.246,"I don't wish what happened today
to cause disputes among the concubines."

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.100,00:43:00.100,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.100,00:43:20.100,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.100,00:43:37.100,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.100,00:43:55.100,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.100,00:44:03.100,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.100,00:44:15.100,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.100,00:44:34.100,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
