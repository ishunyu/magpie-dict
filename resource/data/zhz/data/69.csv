00:02:25.060,00:02:26.090,这几日天热,00:02:25.060,00:02:26.618,The past few days have been hot.
00:02:26.980,00:02:28.090,听跟你的嬷嬷说,00:02:26.980,00:02:28.517,I heard from your nursemaid
00:02:28.560,00:02:29.800,你天天读书到深夜,00:02:28.517,00:02:30.689,that you have stayed up late studying every night.
00:02:31.060,00:02:33.810,刻苦归刻苦 身子也要当心,00:02:30.871,00:02:32.697,Diligence is one thing -
,,,00:02:32.697,00:02:34.730,but you must also take care of your health.
00:02:34.730,00:02:36.350,额娘每晚都让人送汤饮来,00:02:34.730,00:02:36.631,"Mother, you had refreshments sent to me every night."
00:02:36.820,00:02:37.650,儿子不觉劳累,00:02:36.631,00:02:37.688,I don't feel tired.
00:02:38.450,00:02:39.180,那碗汤饮,,,
00:02:39.860,00:02:41.600,是提醒你到了时辰要休息,00:02:38.351,00:02:41.751,"The refreshments are meant as a reminder
 that it is time to rest,"
00:02:42.240,00:02:43.570,而非让你喝了再用功,00:02:42.051,00:02:43.935,rather than continuing your hard work.
00:02:44.330,00:02:45.030,儿子误会,00:02:44.200,00:02:45.491,I misunderstood.
00:02:45.700,00:02:47.610,熹贵妃金安 四阿哥,00:02:45.718,00:02:47.480,"Peace to Noble Consort Lumière, and the Fourth Prince."
00:02:47.910,00:02:48.990,这夜黑风高的 甯娘娘,00:02:47.480,00:02:49.264,"- The night is cold and windy...
- Your Highness."
00:02:49.460,00:02:50.620,你怎么一个人站在这儿,00:02:49.490,00:02:51.080,Why are you standing here alone?
00:02:51.080,00:02:52.370,嫔妾奉旨而来,00:02:51.080,00:02:52.593,"His Majesty ordered me to come,"
00:02:52.920,00:02:54.700,不巧三阿哥正在里面,00:02:52.920,00:02:54.800,but the Third Prince is inside right now.
00:02:55.250,00:02:55.960,苏公公说,,,
00:02:56.550,00:02:57.660,皇上正在生气呢,00:02:55.250,00:02:59.720,"Mr. Su informed me that His Majesty is angered
and told me to wait outside for now."
00:02:58.340,00:02:59.710,叫嫔妾先别进去,,,
00:03:01.550,00:03:04.920,朕要你背魏征的谏太宗十思疏,00:03:01.550,00:03:05.263,"I told you to recite Wei Zheng's
“Ten Recommendations to Emperor Taizong”."
00:03:06.640,00:03:07.850,你背得倒流利,00:03:06.600,00:03:08.450,You recited it with no hesitation.
00:03:09.180,00:03:09.970,朕问你,00:03:09.180,00:03:10.686,But when I asked you
00:03:10.890,00:03:12.380,太宗如何能做到,,,
00:03:13.690,00:03:15.270,垂衣拱手而治,00:03:10.890,00:03:15.400,"how Taizong managed to ""rule with a light hand,"""
00:03:16.780,00:03:18.890,你却支支吾吾说不清楚,00:03:16.780,00:03:19.041,you faltered and couldn't give a clear answer.
00:03:20.070,00:03:21.110,难道在书房,,,
00:03:21.450,00:03:24.150,你的师傅也没有给你讲过,00:03:20.070,00:03:25.320,"Haven't you already learned from your shifu
about the ""benevolent rule"" of Taizong?"
00:03:24.490,00:03:25.320,太宗的德政吗,,,
00:03:25.870,00:03:29.450,贞 贞观政要已经讲过了,00:03:25.870,00:03:29.639,"I've...  I've learned the ""Zhenguan Zhengyao""..."
00:03:30.040,00:03:33.160,皇 皇额娘也叫儿臣细细读过,00:03:30.040,00:03:33.200,Im... Imperial Mother told me to read it thoroughly.
00:03:33.750,00:03:35.910,你师傅和你皇额娘倒勤谨,00:03:33.750,00:03:36.253,Your shifu and Imperial Mother are very diligent.
00:03:36.630,00:03:37.960,你却混账惫懒,00:03:36.480,00:03:38.254,But you are flippant and feckless!
00:03:39.670,00:03:40.960,你五岁上书房,00:03:39.670,00:03:41.174,You began your studies at the age of five.
00:03:41.800,00:03:43.380,如今也十多年了,00:03:41.800,00:03:43.594,More than a decade has since passed.
00:03:44.760,00:03:46.840,竟不知将书都读到哪里去了,00:03:44.760,00:03:47.205,I don't know where all those years of studies have gone.
00:03:48.350,00:03:50.260,朕记得两年前,,,
00:03:50.560,00:03:53.050,你还能将贞观政要背出好多来,00:03:48.350,00:03:53.200,"I remember two years ago, you could recite most of ""Zhenguan Zhengyao."""
00:03:54.230,00:03:56.810,如今竟全都浑忘了,00:03:54.230,00:03:57.153,But now you've forgotten everything!
00:03:58.780,00:04:00.110,亏得你师傅脾气好,00:03:58.760,00:04:00.486,It's fortunate that your shifu has a good temper.
00:04:01.150,00:04:02.060,换做是朕,00:04:01.080,00:04:02.240,"If I were to teach you,"
00:04:03.360,00:04:05.480,在书房看你一天就能气死,00:04:02.800,00:04:05.640,watching you study for a day would have killed me.
00:04:06.200,00:04:06.980,皇阿玛息怒,00:04:06.160,00:04:07.740,"Imperial Father, please calm your anger."
00:04:07.740,00:04:10.030,息怒 朕倒是想息怒,00:04:07.740,00:04:10.466,Calm my anger? I wish I could!
00:04:11.460,00:04:15.240,是你让朕半刻不得安生,00:04:11.460,00:04:15.429,But you don't allow me half a second of peace.
00:04:16.710,00:04:17.870,你是朕的长子,00:04:16.710,00:04:18.134,You are my eldest son.
00:04:19.090,00:04:22.710,朕不求你建功立业 为父分忧,00:04:19.000,00:04:22.800,I don't expect you to achieve greatness or to share my burden.
00:04:23.930,00:04:26.840,但求你为你的几个幼弟,00:04:23.930,00:04:29.240,"I only hope that you can be a good role model for your younger brothers,"
00:04:27.550,00:04:29.010,做个读书的榜样,,,
00:04:29.890,00:04:31.510,好让朕少操些心,00:04:29.760,00:04:31.480,so I have less to worry about.
00:04:32.560,00:04:34.390,你却偏偏做出这许多,00:04:32.560,00:04:36.200,But you persist in behaving like you're good for nothing!
00:04:34.980,00:04:36.060,不成器的样子来,,,
00:04:37.110,00:04:38.190,皇上生好大的气呀,00:04:37.000,00:04:38.529,His Majesty is so enraged.
00:04:40.070,00:04:41.150,皇上是天子,00:04:39.849,00:04:41.520,His Majesty is the Son of Heaven.
00:04:42.690,00:04:45.530,自然不似王爷一般随和无拘,00:04:42.640,00:04:45.719,He cannot be as mild-tempered or carefree as His Lordship.
00:04:46.530,00:04:47.610,王爷还没有孩子呢,00:04:46.320,00:04:47.836,His Lordship doesn't have children yet.
00:04:48.580,00:04:49.660,但他日若有,00:04:48.580,00:04:50.179,"But if he does someday,"
00:04:50.330,00:04:51.320,爱子情切起来,,,
00:04:51.540,00:04:53.370,想必比皇上管教得还严呢,00:04:50.179,00:04:53.621,"he might be even stricter than His Majesty
out of earnest paternal love."
00:04:54.460,00:04:55.200,对了 四阿哥,00:04:54.400,00:04:55.840,"By the way, Fourth Prince,"
00:04:56.040,00:04:57.330,听说你苦读诗书,00:04:55.840,00:04:57.440,I heard that you have been studying rigorously.
00:04:57.710,00:04:59.450,不知皇上讲的你都会不会背呀,00:04:57.710,00:04:59.768,Are you able to recite the books His Majesty mentioned?
00:05:00.300,00:05:01.460,我哪里比得上三哥,00:05:00.200,00:05:02.090,I can't compare to my third brother.
00:05:02.090,00:05:03.200,我开蒙比三哥晚,00:05:02.090,00:05:03.560,I started my studies later than he did.
00:05:03.630,00:05:05.870,甯娘娘说我苦读 也就是我笨,00:05:03.560,00:05:05.185,Your Highness said I study hard -
,,,00:05:05.185,00:05:06.591,that's because I'm dull-witted.
00:05:06.470,00:05:07.830,所以要多花些时间罢了,00:05:06.591,00:05:08.220,I must spend more time studying
00:05:08.220,00:05:10.550,否则 进书房师傅要责罚的,00:05:08.220,00:05:10.663,or else I will be scolded by my shifu.
00:05:10.930,00:05:13.260,这三天好好把文章读通,00:05:10.800,00:05:13.524,Read and comprehend the essay within the next three days!
00:05:13.730,00:05:16.220,再不知文义 便不要来见朕了,00:05:13.524,00:05:16.480,"Don't come see me again
if you cannot grasp its content!"
00:05:24.280,00:05:26.140,熹娘娘好 甯娘娘好,00:05:24.240,00:05:26.240,"Greetings to Consort Lumière, and to Concubine Paix."
00:05:27.820,00:05:28.730,你赶紧进去吧,00:05:27.680,00:05:28.956,You should go inside now.
00:05:38.290,00:05:39.750,皇上今儿在气头上,,,
00:05:40.250,00:05:41.660,说的话难免重了些,00:05:38.200,00:05:41.929,"His Majesty was in an ireful mood.
His words were harsher than usual."
00:05:42.210,00:05:43.000,别往心里去,00:05:42.080,00:05:43.497,Don't take them to heart.
00:05:44.050,00:05:45.410,父子终归是父子,00:05:44.000,00:05:45.599,You are his son after all.
00:05:46.260,00:05:47.340,过几日又好了,00:05:46.109,00:05:47.709,All will be well in a few days.
00:05:48.050,00:05:50.340,是 多谢熹娘娘关怀,00:05:48.000,00:05:50.571,"Yes, I thank Your Highness for your caring words."
00:05:52.010,00:05:54.930,你还要出宫回王府 赶紧去吧,00:05:52.010,00:05:54.397,You still need to return to your estate.
,,,00:05:54.397,00:05:55.266,Go ahead.
00:05:55.560,00:05:58.390,皇额娘还在宫里等着问我功课呢,00:05:55.480,00:05:58.480,Imperial Mother is waiting to go over my studies at her palace.
00:05:59.150,00:06:00.230,都已经这么晚了,00:05:59.080,00:06:00.669,It's already so late.
00:06:01.860,00:06:04.940,那你明日什么时辰起来上书房呢,00:06:01.800,00:06:05.166,At what time will you rise for class tomorrow?
00:06:05.490,00:06:06.220,寅时三刻,00:06:05.480,00:06:06.560,At a quarter to four.
00:06:08.780,00:06:10.240,你每日就睡这几个时辰,00:06:08.640,00:06:10.580,Do you sleep so few hours every day?
00:06:12.240,00:06:14.400,皇额娘说笨鸟先飞,00:06:12.200,00:06:14.900,"Imperial Mother says: ""A clumsy bird needs to fly early."""
00:06:15.290,00:06:16.450,我比不得别人聪明,,,
00:06:17.370,00:06:18.410,便要比别人勤奋,00:06:15.240,00:06:18.780,"I'm not as clever as others,
so I must be more diligent than them."
00:06:19.250,00:06:20.860,所以要日夜苦读,00:06:19.200,00:06:21.297,That's why I must study hard day and night.
00:06:21.590,00:06:22.870,皇后希望你争气,00:06:21.590,00:06:23.299,The Empress wants you to nurture your ambitions.
00:06:23.670,00:06:25.040,你也得爱惜自己的身子,00:06:23.670,00:06:25.309,But you also ought to take care of yourself.
00:06:26.260,00:06:27.420,听你皇阿玛说,,,
00:06:28.010,00:06:29.370,已经给你物色福晋了,00:06:26.260,00:06:29.440,"I heard your Imperial Father has
started selecting a wife for you."
00:06:30.390,00:06:33.090,早日成家立业也好有人照顾你,00:06:30.390,00:06:32.240,It's good to start your family early
,,,00:06:32.240,00:06:34.260,so you will have someone to look after you.
00:06:34.260,00:06:36.470,是 时候不早了,00:06:34.260,00:06:35.141,Yes.
00:06:37.680,00:06:38.640,儿臣先告退了,00:06:35.612,00:06:38.923,"It's quite late, please allow me to take my leave."
00:06:44.270,00:06:46.730,额娘 您看三哥这么用功,00:06:44.270,00:06:46.730,"Mother, you see how hardworking my third brother is."
00:06:48.110,00:06:49.400,我一定要比他更用功,00:06:48.110,00:06:49.400,I must work harder than him
00:06:49.950,00:06:51.030,皇阿玛才会喜欢我,00:06:49.950,00:06:51.713,so that Imperial Father will be fond of me.
00:06:52.700,00:06:54.310,方才你对案嫔娘娘说,00:06:52.700,00:06:54.310,You just told Concubine Paix
00:06:55.370,00:06:57.320,皇上说的那些书你都不会背,00:06:55.370,00:06:57.663,that you haven't memorized all the essays His Majesty mentioned.
00:06:58.250,00:07:00.160,可前几日额娘才听你背过,00:06:58.250,00:07:00.462,"But a few days back, I heard you recite them fluently"
00:07:00.750,00:07:02.710,而且文义皆通 字字详熟,00:07:00.750,00:07:02.924,and your comprehension was profound.
00:07:03.420,00:07:04.700,额娘凡事不喜张扬,00:07:03.420,00:07:05.130,"Mother, I've observed how you keep a low profile."
00:07:05.130,00:07:06.990,儿子耳濡目染 自然明白,00:07:05.130,00:07:07.547,"""My eyes and ears have been immersed,""
so I understand what I should do."
00:07:08.260,00:07:09.090,你很聪明,00:07:08.260,00:07:09.412,You are smart.
00:07:09.590,00:07:12.800,母子一脉 儿子当然像额娘了,00:07:09.590,00:07:12.800,"Mother and son ""share the same pulse.""
Of course I'm like you."
00:07:16.390,00:07:18.850,额娘 三哥是长子,00:07:16.390,00:07:19.310,"Mother, my third brother is the eldest son."
00:07:19.310,00:07:20.340,他会不会当皇帝,00:07:19.310,00:07:20.597,Will he become the Emperor?
00:07:21.810,00:07:22.720,额娘不知道,00:07:21.810,00:07:22.977,I don't know.
00:07:23.190,00:07:24.680,可是六弟是额娘亲生的,00:07:23.190,00:07:25.020,But my sixth brother was born to you
00:07:25.020,00:07:25.890,皇阿玛也最喜欢,00:07:25.020,00:07:26.591,and Imperial Father adores him the most.
00:07:26.440,00:07:27.100,所以他会,00:07:26.591,00:07:27.720,So he will be crowned.
00:07:27.780,00:07:28.860,只要六弟当了皇帝,00:07:27.780,00:07:29.240,"As long as my sixth brother becomes the Emperor,"
00:07:29.240,00:07:30.070,儿子就高兴了,00:07:29.240,00:07:30.400,I will be happy.
00:07:32.610,00:07:33.520,你六弟还小,00:07:32.610,00:07:33.809,"Your sixth brother is still young,"
00:07:35.030,00:07:38.320,而且额娘也不喜欢他当皇帝,00:07:35.030,00:07:38.320,and I don't wish for him to be the emperor.
00:07:40.160,00:07:41.320,我朝的天子,00:07:40.160,00:07:41.920,Only the most worthy of all
00:07:42.460,00:07:44.240,只有贤能者才能胜任,00:07:42.460,00:07:44.626,is capable of ruling the Empire.
00:07:45.380,00:07:45.990,明白吗,00:07:45.380,00:07:46.398,Do you understand?
00:07:47.250,00:07:47.790,是,00:07:47.250,00:07:47.919,Yes.
00:07:50.590,00:07:53.210,弘时啊 你可有中意的女子了,00:07:50.590,00:07:53.210,"Hongshi, do any of these ladies catch your eye?"
00:07:55.050,00:07:58.470,额娘慈爱一切由额娘做主即可,00:07:55.050,00:07:58.693,"Mother, you're benevolent to ask.
Allow me to obey your decision."
00:07:59.020,00:08:00.130,你就放眼去挑吧,00:07:59.020,00:08:00.584,Choose whomever you prefer
00:08:00.560,00:08:03.390,选中哪一个 自己跟皇阿玛去说,00:08:00.584,00:08:03.390,and inform your Imperial Father yourself.
00:08:04.060,00:08:05.220,你已经长大了,00:08:04.060,00:08:05.520,You've grown up.
00:08:05.520,00:08:07.100,额娘只能为你安排,00:08:05.520,00:08:07.270,I will only make arrangements
00:08:07.570,00:08:08.810,不会为你做主的,00:08:07.270,00:08:08.999,and not decisions for you.
00:08:15.200,00:08:15.940,熹娘娘好,00:08:15.200,00:08:15.940,"Greetings, Your Highness."
00:08:16.830,00:08:18.780,熹贵妃娘娘金安,00:08:16.830,00:08:18.780,Peace to Noble Consort Lumière.
00:08:20.790,00:08:22.320,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:08:20.790,00:08:22.406,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:08:22.870,00:08:23.580,起来吧,00:08:22.620,00:08:23.580,Rise.
00:08:23.830,00:08:24.540,谢娘娘,00:08:23.830,00:08:24.669,I thank Your Majesty.
00:08:28.250,00:08:28.990,都起来吧,00:08:28.250,00:08:29.033,You all may rise.
00:08:29.710,00:08:31.580,谢熹贵妃娘娘,00:08:29.710,00:08:31.580,I thank Your Noble Highness.
00:08:32.380,00:08:33.420,今日初次相见,00:08:32.380,00:08:33.930,This is the first time we meet
00:08:33.930,00:08:35.420,来日还有相见之时呢,00:08:33.930,00:08:35.420,and perhaps the first of many.
00:08:37.220,00:08:38.800,三阿哥愈发长高了,00:08:37.220,00:08:39.040,The Third Prince has grown taller.
00:08:39.140,00:08:40.420,难得天气凉快,00:08:39.140,00:08:40.770,The weather is pleasantly cooler today.
00:08:40.770,00:08:42.380,请你和敬贵妃来坐坐,00:08:40.770,00:08:42.633,I invited you and Noble Consort Estime
00:08:42.890,00:08:43.970,也放眼挑挑,00:08:42.633,00:08:45.301,to aid in choosing exceptional young ladies.
00:08:44.230,00:08:46.090,看看有没有出色的女孩子呀,,,
00:08:50.690,00:08:52.270,皇后娘娘的眼光极佳,,,
00:08:52.990,00:08:54.940,臣妾只觉得个个都是好的,00:08:52.990,00:08:55.154,Every one of them looks perfect to me!
00:08:55.990,00:08:57.150,那就慢慢看吧,00:08:55.990,00:08:57.450,Take your time -
00:08:57.450,00:08:58.610,总会看到一个好的,00:08:57.450,00:08:58.739,you'll find the outstanding one.
00:09:02.660,00:09:03.740,让咱们来这里,00:09:02.660,00:09:04.234,Her Majesty invited us here
00:09:05.250,00:09:07.790,怕来日里如果三阿哥说喜欢谁,00:09:05.250,00:09:07.790,so we can chime in with our support
00:09:08.420,00:09:09.830,咱们能够帮着说一嘴,00:09:08.420,00:09:10.000,if the Third Prince has a preference.
00:09:11.550,00:09:14.000,她怕别人觉得是她一个人做主,00:09:11.550,00:09:14.340,"She doesn't want others to think
she made the decision on her own;"
00:09:14.340,00:09:15.670,就连咱们都中意似的,00:09:14.340,00:09:15.884,it will look like we all approve.
00:09:17.140,00:09:18.090,皇后看上谁了,00:09:17.140,00:09:18.362,Who is in the Empress's favor?
00:09:18.640,00:09:19.720,皇后娘娘的外甥女,00:09:18.640,00:09:19.720,Her own niece.
00:09:20.060,00:09:21.840,穿绿衣服那个 叫青樱的,00:09:20.060,00:09:22.560,The one dressed in green. Her name is Qingying.
00:09:23.560,00:09:24.920,青樱啊 你过来,00:09:23.560,00:09:25.920,"Qingying, come over and greet the Third Prince."
00:09:25.230,00:09:26.010,见过三阿哥,,,
00:09:26.390,00:09:26.970,是,00:09:26.390,00:09:26.970,Yes.
00:09:31.520,00:09:32.260,三阿哥好,00:09:31.520,00:09:32.800,"Greetings, Third Prince."
00:09:33.690,00:09:35.350,这是你堂舅舅的幼女,00:09:33.690,00:09:37.193,"This is my cousin's youngest daughter.
You can call her your cousin."
00:09:35.700,00:09:36.860,你应该叫她表妹,,,
00:09:38.780,00:09:39.360,表妹,00:09:38.780,00:09:39.831,Cousin.
00:09:40.030,00:09:41.270,臣女小字青樱,00:09:40.030,00:09:41.807,"Third Prince, my maiden name is Qingying."
00:09:46.830,00:09:50.320,这花和皇额娘宫中的牡丹,00:09:47.762,00:09:51.682,"These flowers are just as pretty as the peonies
in Imperial Mother's palace."
00:09:50.750,00:09:51.740,一样好看呢,,,
00:09:53.050,00:09:53.830,多谢公主夸奖,00:09:53.050,00:09:54.581,"Thank you for the kind words, Princess."
00:09:56.220,00:09:57.920,胧月 过来,00:09:56.220,00:09:57.920,"Longyue, come here."
00:10:00.350,00:10:03.050,胧月 那边的紫薇开了花,00:10:00.350,00:10:03.050,"Longyue, the myrtle trees over there are blooming."
00:10:03.470,00:10:05.010,额娘带你去看花好不好,00:10:03.470,00:10:05.612,"- How about we go check them out?
- Hmm, yes."
00:10:05.810,00:10:06.260,好,,,
00:10:06.520,00:10:08.050,本宫宫中的紫薇开得最好,00:10:06.520,00:10:08.438,The myrtle flowers are the finest in my palace.
00:10:08.650,00:10:10.730,诸位尽可自行观赏啊,00:10:08.650,00:10:10.730,You may all view them as you please.
00:10:11.980,00:10:13.600,臣妾告退,00:10:11.980,00:10:13.600,"We take our leave, Your Majesty."
00:10:26.660,00:10:28.750,听说阿哥喜食姜香梅子,00:10:26.660,00:10:28.750,"Prince, I heard you like gingered plums,"
00:10:29.330,00:10:30.490,臣女特来奉上,00:10:29.330,00:10:30.490,may I offer you some?
00:10:32.340,00:10:33.070,你说这个,00:10:32.340,00:10:33.579,Oh these plums?
00:10:33.960,00:10:35.700,其实也谈不上喜欢,00:10:34.006,00:10:36.760,It's not that I particularly like them.
00:10:36.760,00:10:37.840,只是皇额娘说,00:10:36.760,00:10:38.240,Imperial Mother says that
00:10:38.260,00:10:40.720,梅子生津止渴 姜能暖胃,00:10:38.260,00:10:40.720,"plums stimulate the appetite, and ginger warms the Stomach,"
00:10:41.300,00:10:43.460,所以制成果子要我多食,00:10:41.300,00:10:43.460,so she encourages me to have them.
00:10:44.180,00:10:46.590,皇后是为了阿哥的身体着想,00:10:44.180,00:10:46.590,"Her Majesty truly cares about your well-being, Prince."
00:10:46.980,00:10:48.680,阿哥应听从皇后之意,00:10:46.980,00:10:48.913,You ought to follow Her Majesty's advice.
00:10:52.110,00:10:54.020,你似乎不怎么喜欢小孩子吧,00:10:52.110,00:10:54.253,"You don't seem to like children, do you?"
00:10:54.690,00:10:56.850,小孩子总是顽皮不懂事,00:10:54.690,00:10:56.160,Children are naughty and careless.
00:10:57.280,00:10:59.890,我们做大人的无须和他们计较,00:10:57.273,00:10:59.680,Grown-ups shouldn't mind their mistakes.
00:11:00.410,00:11:01.520,也不必理会他们,00:11:00.000,00:11:02.124,We don't need to pay attention to them.
00:11:02.620,00:11:03.650,臣女这身衣服,,,
00:11:03.950,00:11:05.820,是为了觐见阿哥特意所制,00:11:02.620,00:11:05.640,"I had this dress made especially for meeting you, Prince."
00:11:06.490,00:11:08.330,都让别人碰坏了可怎么好,00:11:06.490,00:11:08.330,How could I let someone damage it?
00:11:11.500,00:11:13.040,好吧 胧月 过来,00:11:11.500,00:11:13.312,"I see. Longyue, come here."
00:11:16.090,00:11:18.040,这个姜香梅子是你最喜欢的,00:11:16.090,00:11:18.040,"Here’s your favorite, gingered plums."
00:11:18.210,00:11:18.870,拿去吃吧,00:11:18.210,00:11:19.260,They’re all yours.
00:11:19.260,00:11:20.750,三哥最疼胧月了,00:11:19.260,00:11:20.970,"Third Brother, you are the best to me!"
00:11:20.970,00:11:21.550,吃吧,00:11:20.970,00:11:21.667,Enjoy!
00:11:24.800,00:11:27.340,胧月 走 额娘带你去看花去,00:11:24.800,00:11:27.383,"Longyue, let’s go. I’ll take you to see the flowers."
00:11:32.480,00:11:33.760,大约是我们在这儿,,,
00:11:34.060,00:11:35.470,孩子们也觉得不自在,00:11:32.480,00:11:35.440,"Perhaps the young people are feeling
a bit inhibited because of our presence."
00:11:36.860,00:11:37.770,起风了,00:11:36.860,00:11:38.150,It's getting windy.
00:11:38.150,00:11:40.980,熹贵妃 本宫要回去更衣了,00:11:38.150,00:11:41.174,"Noble Consort Lumière, I’ll return and get changed."
00:11:45.580,00:11:46.440,额娘不见了,00:11:45.580,00:11:46.780,I can’t find Mother!
00:11:46.780,00:11:48.650,熹娘娘陪我去找找吧,00:11:46.780,00:11:48.821,Will Your Highness help me look for her?
00:11:51.080,00:11:51.870,陪她去吧,00:11:51.080,00:11:52.196,Go ahead.
00:11:52.420,00:11:53.870,那臣妾先告退了,00:11:52.420,00:11:53.870,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:12:02.680,00:12:03.460,在这儿呢,00:12:02.680,00:12:03.783,I'm here!
00:12:04.550,00:12:05.920,怎么出来也不说一下,00:12:04.550,00:12:06.049,How did you leave the garden without notice.
00:12:06.720,00:12:08.090,幸好皇后未曾怪罪,00:12:06.720,00:12:08.323,"Fortunately, the Empress didn't fault you for that."
00:12:08.720,00:12:09.930,她哪有那个心思啊,00:12:08.720,00:12:10.230,She isn't thinking of that now;
00:12:10.230,00:12:11.470,她现在心心念念的,,,
00:12:11.850,00:12:13.680,都是她乌拉那拉氏的荣华富贵,00:12:10.230,00:12:13.534,"she’s too engrossed in the glory and wealth
of her Ula-Nara clan."
00:12:14.060,00:12:15.020,哪会想着咱们,00:12:13.845,00:12:15.760,She doesn't care what we do.
00:12:15.770,00:12:17.730,我是看你呀 实在惩得慌,00:12:15.770,00:12:18.020,You looked so bored sitting there.
00:12:18.020,00:12:20.190,便找个由头 让胧月骗你出来,00:12:18.020,00:12:20.404,So I came up with an excuse for Longyue to get you out.
00:12:21.530,00:12:23.640,你瞧那些女孩子 个个出挑,00:12:21.530,00:12:23.640,"Just look at those young ladies.
Each one is remarkable."
00:12:24.110,00:12:25.690,可三阿哥好像并不在意,00:12:24.110,00:12:25.904,But the Third Prince seems indifferent.
00:12:26.990,00:12:27.650,是啊,00:12:26.990,00:12:28.030,That's true.
00:12:28.030,00:12:31.450,胧月 你看你三阿哥好像不太开心,00:12:28.030,00:12:31.664,"Longyue, your third brother looks dispirited."
00:12:31.870,00:12:32.830,快去把他叫过来,00:12:31.870,00:12:33.210,Go ask him to join us.
00:12:33.210,00:12:35.370,让他过来散散心 别惩坏了,00:12:33.210,00:12:35.750,Invite him to take a walk and relax.
00:12:35.750,00:12:36.330,快去,00:12:35.750,00:12:36.501,Hurry.
00:12:50.560,00:12:51.340,三哥,,,
00:12:51.680,00:12:54.350,你不喜欢那些漂亮姐姐吗,00:12:50.560,00:12:54.577,"Third brother, why don't you like those pretty girls?"
00:12:55.140,00:12:56.550,我不喜欢骄矜的女人,00:12:55.140,00:12:57.180,I don’t like conceited women.
00:12:57.310,00:12:58.640,也不喜欢做作的女人,00:12:57.491,00:12:59.512,Or pretentious women.
00:12:59.900,00:13:02.270,和三哥一样 我也不喜欢,00:12:59.900,00:13:02.270,"Me too. I don’t like such women, either."
00:13:02.570,00:13:04.270,三哥喜欢什么样的,00:13:02.270,00:13:04.425,"Then, what kind of women do you like?"
00:13:05.410,00:13:06.900,温柔 沉静,00:13:05.410,00:13:06.900,Gentle... and serene.
00:13:08.070,00:13:09.940,三哥是嫌我话多,00:13:08.070,00:13:09.940,You think I’m too much of a chatterbox?
00:13:10.410,00:13:12.120,你呀 最可爱了,00:13:10.410,00:13:12.198,Not at all. You’re most adorable!
00:13:14.290,00:13:15.620,这花的颜色怎么,,,
00:13:16.000,00:13:18.490,和早晨额娘带我来时不一样了,00:13:14.290,00:13:18.480,"Why has this flower changed color?
Mother brought me here this morning."
00:13:19.340,00:13:20.670,此花唤作美人面,00:13:19.340,00:13:21.056,This flower is called “a beauty's visage”.
00:13:21.550,00:13:23.750,日出变红 日落变粉,00:13:21.550,00:13:23.750,It is red at sunrise and turns pink when the sun sets.
00:13:24.420,00:13:27.040,就像美人面孔一日多变,00:13:24.420,00:13:27.510,The color is as fleeting as the expressions on a beauty's face.
00:13:27.510,00:13:29.720,嬉笑怒骂 宜喜宜喷,00:13:27.510,00:13:30.277,Laughing or frowning as her mood changes.
00:13:30.640,00:13:32.420,这位姐姐便是美人面,,,
00:13:32.720,00:13:34.260,三哥说是不是呀,00:13:30.640,00:13:35.043,"This sister in front of us has the “visage of a beauty”.
Third brother, don't you think so?"
00:13:35.940,00:13:40.520,名花倾国两相欢,00:13:35.940,00:13:41.206,"""The renowned peony mudan, paired with
her beauty which could topple a nation."""
00:13:46.610,00:13:48.600,我怎担得起公主叫一声姐姐,00:13:46.610,00:13:48.600,"Princess, I don't deserve being called ""sister."""
00:13:48.950,00:13:50.230,公主 我是瑛贵人,00:13:48.950,00:13:50.463,I am Noble Lady Lustré.
00:13:51.120,00:13:53.480,瑛贵人 我怎没见过,00:13:51.120,00:13:53.909,Noble Lady Lustré? How is it I’ve never met you?
00:13:54.370,00:13:55.160,这位是,00:13:54.370,00:13:55.460,And you are…?
00:13:55.460,00:13:56.410,这是我三哥,00:13:55.460,00:13:56.788,This is my third brother.
00:13:59.000,00:14:00.120,三阿哥万福,00:13:59.000,00:14:00.291,Peace to the Third Prince.
00:14:01.290,00:14:02.080,三哥,,,
00:14:02.300,00:14:04.960,瑛娘娘也算是我们的额娘,00:14:01.290,00:14:04.960,"Third brother, Noble Lady Lustré counts as one of our mothers."
00:14:05.210,00:14:08.050,你少在后宫走动 难怪不认识,00:14:05.210,00:14:08.350,"You hardly visit the harem.
That's why you don’t know her."
00:14:11.220,00:14:12.210,瑛娘娘万福,00:14:11.220,00:14:12.640,Peace to Your Highness.
00:14:12.720,00:14:15.180,三哥万福 瑛娘娘也万福,00:14:12.720,00:14:15.180,"Peace to third brother, peace to Your Highness."
00:14:15.640,00:14:16.880,你们都万福,00:14:15.640,00:14:17.035,Peace to everyone!
00:14:17.560,00:14:19.180,瑛娘娘一个人在这里赏花,00:14:17.560,00:14:21.374,"Your Highness seems pensive, contemplating the flowers alone."
00:14:20.100,00:14:21.090,好像闷闷不乐,,,
00:14:22.650,00:14:24.230,只是想念家中亲人,00:14:22.650,00:14:24.534,I was just thinking of my family at home.
00:14:25.400,00:14:26.480,不能入宫觐见吗,00:14:25.400,00:14:26.987,They can’t come visit you in the palace?
00:14:27.490,00:14:29.940,见了还是要散 聚少离多,00:14:27.490,00:14:30.240,"It's a short reunion, and then more time apart."
00:14:32.700,00:14:33.820,我亲额娘去了,00:14:32.700,00:14:34.237,My birth mother passed away.
00:14:34.910,00:14:36.150,想见也见不到了,00:14:34.910,00:14:36.364,I can't see her even if I wanted to.
00:14:37.250,00:14:38.410,阿哥不必伤心,00:14:37.250,00:14:38.790,"Prince, please don’t have a heavy heart."
00:14:38.790,00:14:40.450,虽然阿哥的亲额娘不在了,00:14:38.790,00:14:40.983,"Although your birth mother is no longer here,"
00:14:41.170,00:14:42.370,但无论何时何地,,,
00:14:42.710,00:14:43.950,她都会心系阿哥的,00:14:41.170,00:14:43.920,she is still watching over you wherever you are.
00:14:45.170,00:14:46.380,她以前做任何事,00:14:45.170,00:14:47.170,And all her actions in her life
00:14:47.170,00:14:48.540,肯定也是为了阿哥好,00:14:47.170,00:14:48.957,would have been done for your benefit.
00:14:50.220,00:14:51.460,多谢瑛娘娘开解,00:14:50.220,00:14:51.958,I thank Your Highness for such a thoughtful perspective.
00:14:53.720,00:14:55.460,瑛娘娘怎么不带个人伺候啊,00:14:53.720,00:14:56.310,Why is Your Highness unattended by a servant?
00:14:56.310,00:14:57.760,带个人伺候又如何,00:14:56.310,00:14:58.114,What difference would a servant make?
00:14:58.310,00:15:00.600,陪着的人不是懂自己的人,00:14:58.310,00:15:01.943,"Having a companion who doesn’t understand you
is no better than being alone."
00:15:00.940,00:15:01.850,也是白陪着,,,
00:15:03.900,00:15:06.510,有的时候觉得人多会好些,00:15:03.900,00:15:06.510,It's true. Sometimes it seems there would be comfort in a crowd
00:15:07.690,00:15:09.060,可有的时候又觉得,00:15:07.690,00:15:09.060,"but often,"
00:15:09.900,00:15:13.110,人越多 心里越孤单,00:15:09.900,00:15:13.110,"the bigger the crowd, the lonlier one can feel."
00:15:16.370,00:15:18.160,阿哥所说正是这个理,00:15:16.370,00:15:18.354,"You're right about that, Prince."
00:15:19.080,00:15:21.240,时候不早了 我先告辞了,00:15:19.080,00:15:21.669,It’s getting late. Allow me to take my leave.
00:15:32.510,00:15:34.170,原来人多陪着还是孤单,00:15:32.510,00:15:34.599,One can be lonely however many companions there are.
00:15:35.760,00:15:37.130,只有知心人陪着,00:15:35.760,00:15:39.560,"Only a true confidante's companionship
 can bring happiness."
00:15:38.350,00:15:39.590,才是真正快活了,,,
00:15:40.310,00:15:42.890,三哥 你嘟囔什么呢,00:15:40.310,00:15:43.061,"What are you mumbling, third brother?"
00:15:45.480,00:15:46.890,没什么 走吧,00:15:45.480,00:15:47.190,It's nothing. Let’s go.
00:16:13.430,00:16:16.340,宫里皇贵妃的琵琶最好,00:16:13.430,00:16:16.340,Imperial Noble Consort is the best pipa player in the entire palace.
00:16:17.560,00:16:19.140,熹贵妃的琴最好,00:16:17.560,00:16:19.554,Noble Consort Lumière is the best on the qin zither.
00:16:20.350,00:16:22.840,论筝你当属第一,00:16:20.350,00:16:23.040,"But on the zheng zither, you are the best."
00:16:24.770,00:16:26.100,臣妾雕虫小技,,,
00:16:26.520,00:16:28.100,怎能和各位娘娘相较,00:16:24.770,00:16:28.380,My slight skills can't compare with Their Highnesses'.
00:16:28.980,00:16:31.770,你性子安静 不喜欢争宠,00:16:28.980,00:16:31.770,You have a calm nature and never vie for favor.
00:16:32.110,00:16:33.480,自然有你的好处,00:16:32.110,00:16:33.952,You certainly have your good qualities.
00:16:40.290,00:16:42.780,皇上 三阿哥来了,00:16:40.290,00:16:42.780,"Your Majesty, the Third Prince is here."
00:16:43.370,00:16:44.110,叫他进来吧,00:16:43.370,00:16:44.330,Show him in.
00:16:44.330,00:16:44.910,嗻,00:16:44.330,00:16:45.039,Yes.
00:16:47.750,00:16:48.960,那臣妾先告退,00:16:47.750,00:16:49.240,"Your Majesty, I shall take my leave."
00:16:49.300,00:16:52.130,不必 你也是他的长辈,00:16:49.300,00:16:52.130,No need to leave. You're his elder.
00:17:04.980,00:17:05.890,皇阿玛吉祥,00:17:04.980,00:17:05.968,Peace to Imperial Father.
00:17:08.110,00:17:09.390,怎么这个时候过来了,00:17:08.110,00:17:09.600,What brings you here at this hour?
00:17:09.820,00:17:10.980,今儿的书都温完了,00:17:09.820,00:17:11.151,Have you finished reviewing your schoolwork?
00:17:11.440,00:17:12.180,都温过了,00:17:11.440,00:17:12.200,Yes. I’ve reviewed all of it.
00:17:12.570,00:17:14.810,师傅讲的文章儿臣也都通读了,00:17:12.570,00:17:15.070,I also studied the essays that were covered in class.
00:17:15.070,00:17:15.730,那就好,00:17:15.070,00:17:16.014,That’s good.
00:17:16.740,00:17:18.700,朕改日再问你的书,00:17:16.740,00:17:18.990,I’ll quiz you on it another day.
00:17:18.990,00:17:20.900,皇阿玛 儿臣此来,00:17:18.990,00:17:20.000,"Imperial Father,"
00:17:21.240,00:17:22.230,就是为了读书之事,00:17:20.000,00:17:21.920,"actually, I'm here about my schooling."
00:17:22.580,00:17:23.490,来请求皇阿玛的,00:17:21.920,00:17:23.490,I would like to ask for your permission.
00:17:23.660,00:17:24.370,你说,00:17:23.660,00:17:24.370,Go ahead.
00:17:25.080,00:17:27.290,皇阿玛和皇额娘觉得儿臣长大了,00:17:25.080,00:17:27.508,Imperial Father and Mother think I've grown up
00:17:27.670,00:17:28.530,该成家立业了,00:17:27.508,00:17:29.166,and that it's time I establish a family.
00:17:29.290,00:17:30.120,可儿臣觉得,,,
00:17:30.420,00:17:32.130,眼下是努力读书的好时候,00:17:29.290,00:17:32.206,"But I think I should prioritize my studies right now,"
00:17:33.340,00:17:34.830,不想沉溺于儿女私情,00:17:33.340,00:17:35.371,instead of indulging myself in affairs of the heart.
00:17:35.590,00:17:38.130,所以还不想成家娶福晋,00:17:35.590,00:17:38.559,So I'd rather not get married yet.
00:17:38.800,00:17:40.540,朕和你皇额娘的意思,00:17:38.800,00:17:42.520,"Your mother and I had the intention
to find someone to look after you."
00:17:40.930,00:17:42.840,原本是想多个人照顾你,,,
00:17:43.100,00:17:44.340,可平时有奴才们照顾,00:17:43.100,00:17:45.440,I’m already well looked after by my servants.
00:17:44.640,00:17:45.430,已经很好了呀,,,
00:17:46.230,00:17:48.390,若有了福晋 难免会分心,00:17:46.230,00:17:48.854,Having a wife will inevitably distract me from my studies.
00:17:49.230,00:17:50.350,儿臣自知无能,,,
00:17:51.150,00:17:52.480,不能为皇阿玛分忧,00:17:49.230,00:17:53.000,"I know that I am too incompetent to share
any of your burdens, Imperial Father."
00:17:53.110,00:17:54.940,所以想好好读书,00:17:53.110,00:17:56.506,So I aspire to stay dedicated and not worry you.
00:17:55.320,00:17:56.150,让皇阿玛放心,,,
00:17:57.700,00:17:59.860,你若这样想 朕也就放心了,00:17:57.700,00:17:59.860,I am relieved you think this way.
00:18:00.240,00:18:02.110,左右也是你皇额娘的意思,00:18:00.240,00:18:02.560,This was your Imperial Mother’s idea in the first place.
00:18:02.580,00:18:03.530,朕也不急,00:18:02.580,00:18:04.000,I’m in no hurry for you to wed.
00:18:04.080,00:18:07.040,皇阿玛 儿臣也想日后,00:18:04.080,00:18:07.360,"Imperial Father, I hope I'll marry"
00:18:07.750,00:18:09.360,娶个贤惠安静的福晋,00:18:07.767,00:18:09.617,a virtuous and gentle wife one day.
00:18:10.170,00:18:12.700,是啊 夫妻和睦最要紧,00:18:10.170,00:18:13.128,Indeed. Marital harmony matters the most.
00:18:14.760,00:18:15.490,你先回去吧,00:18:14.760,00:18:15.880,You may leave now.
00:18:15.880,00:18:16.540,是,00:18:15.880,00:18:16.754,Yes.
00:18:20.510,00:18:21.300,瑛娘娘的筝,00:18:20.510,00:18:22.165,Noble Lady Lustré plays the zheng as if
00:18:21.720,00:18:24.010,如昆山玉碎 芙蓉泣露,00:18:22.388,00:18:25.858,"""chiming the Kunlun Mountains jade,""
or ""the drip of dew onto lotus flowers."""
00:18:26.930,00:18:27.840,儿臣拜服,00:18:26.930,00:18:28.399,I admire Your Higness's talent.
00:18:29.600,00:18:30.840,多谢三阿哥夸奖,00:18:29.600,00:18:31.034,"Thank you for the compliment, Third Prince."
00:18:31.610,00:18:32.470,你倒会听,00:18:31.610,00:18:32.800,You have a good ear.
00:18:33.320,00:18:36.310,这首高山流水是瑛贵人最拿手的,00:18:33.320,00:18:36.310,"""High Mountain and Flowing Water""
is Noble Lady Lustré's best piece."
00:18:38.490,00:18:39.070,去吧,00:18:38.490,00:18:39.200,Go on.
00:18:39.570,00:18:40.310,是,00:18:39.570,00:18:40.310,Yes.
00:18:47.660,00:18:48.740,姑姑就送到这儿吧,00:18:47.660,00:18:49.120,"Madam Autumn, please stay."
00:18:49.120,00:18:49.860,格格请留步,00:18:49.120,00:18:50.311,"Please wait, My Lady."
00:18:50.750,00:18:51.580,姑姑有何事啊,00:18:50.750,00:18:51.942,"What is it, Madam?"
00:18:52.340,00:18:54.080,格格虽然一时不能成为福晋,00:18:52.340,00:18:54.352,"Although you can't become the primary wife right now,"
00:18:54.670,00:18:56.210,可是娘娘的话在理啊,00:18:54.670,00:18:56.486,Her Majesty had a valid point.
00:18:57.210,00:18:58.880,不如先不顾及名分,00:18:57.210,00:18:59.260,"Why don't you set aside concern for the title,"
00:18:59.260,00:19:00.290,就以侍妾的身份,,,
00:19:00.590,00:19:01.630,在三阿哥身边伺候,00:18:59.260,00:19:01.630,"and for now, serve the Third Prince as his concubine?"
00:19:02.050,00:19:03.460,到时也可以升为福晋啊,00:19:02.050,00:19:03.674,You can then be promoted later.
00:19:03.850,00:19:06.380,姑母当年再不济也是个侧福晋,00:19:03.850,00:19:06.509,My aunt's lowest title was still Lord Consort.
00:19:07.180,00:19:08.140,如今我倒只能当个,,,
00:19:08.520,00:19:09.680,没名没分的侍妾了,00:19:07.180,00:19:09.766,Now she wants me to be just a titleless concubine?
00:19:10.480,00:19:11.890,姑母当真是心疼我,00:19:10.480,00:19:12.278,I can see how much she cares for me!
00:19:12.520,00:19:14.100,格格不要看一时的长短,00:19:12.520,00:19:14.143,"You should think long-term, My Lady."
00:19:14.690,00:19:15.680,忍辱负重吧,00:19:14.690,00:19:16.323,"""Endure the indignity and carry the heaviness."""
00:19:16.860,00:19:17.690,忍辱,00:19:16.860,00:19:17.931,Endure the indignity?
00:19:18.690,00:19:20.360,难道我受的屈辱还不够大吗,00:19:18.690,00:19:20.752,Haven't I endured enough humiliation already?
00:19:21.320,00:19:22.480,三阿哥看不上我,00:19:21.320,00:19:23.024,The Third Prince doesn't cast his eyes on me.
00:19:23.240,00:19:24.980,连皇上都答应不选福晋了,00:19:23.240,00:19:25.513,Even His Majesty agrees the Third Prince won't be selecting a wife.
00:19:25.950,00:19:27.910,我现在成了满皇宫的笑柄了,00:19:25.950,00:19:28.081,I'm already the laughingstock of the palace.
00:19:28.660,00:19:29.450,那我算什么,,,
00:19:29.960,00:19:31.370,还不顾廉耻地贴上去,00:19:28.660,00:19:31.642,"Should I shamelessly shove my face in his?
Then how would I be seen?"
00:19:32.120,00:19:34.540,请姑姑转告 多谢姑母厚爱,00:19:32.120,00:19:34.863,"Please tell my aunt how thankful I am
for her generous condiseration."
00:19:36.340,00:19:37.200,格格慢走,00:19:36.340,00:19:37.286,"Take care, My Lady."
00:19:46.850,00:19:47.630,娘娘,00:19:46.850,00:19:47.716,Your Majesty.
00:19:48.020,00:19:48.850,送出去了,00:19:48.020,00:19:48.979,Has she been sent off?
00:19:49.980,00:19:52.310,是 格格不大高兴了,00:19:49.980,00:19:52.310,Yes. Lady Qingying wasn't happy.
00:19:53.060,00:19:54.850,有跟她说是本宫的意思吗,00:19:53.060,00:19:54.850,Did you convey my message?
00:19:55.440,00:19:57.480,格格气性高 断断不肯,00:19:55.440,00:19:57.480,"Yes, but My Lady Qingying was too high-minded to comply."
00:20:01.320,00:20:03.530,年轻啊 沉不住气,00:20:01.320,00:20:03.647,"She's still young, and impetuous."
00:20:04.620,00:20:07.110,侍妾又如何 福晋又如何,00:20:04.620,00:20:07.110,It wouldn't matter now if she is the wife or a concubine.
00:20:08.080,00:20:10.070,等到三阿哥继承了皇位,00:20:08.080,00:20:10.327,"Once the Third Prince succeeds to the throne,"
00:20:10.620,00:20:12.280,本宫就是皇太后,00:20:10.620,00:20:12.666,I will become the Empress Dowager.
00:20:12.920,00:20:16.660,要皇帝立谁做皇后 谁就是皇后,00:20:12.920,00:20:16.660,It will be up to me to decide who is the next Empress.
00:20:17.670,00:20:21.040,皇后之位一定要是乌拉那拉氏的,00:20:17.670,00:20:21.040,The Empress must come from the Ula-Nara family.
00:20:21.550,00:20:22.330,娘娘说得是,00:20:21.550,00:20:22.851,Your Majesty is correct.
00:20:23.050,00:20:25.420,格格还年轻 哪想得这些厉害,00:20:23.050,00:20:25.677,Lady Qingying is still too young to understand this.
00:20:26.220,00:20:28.430,可惜呀 她不肯,00:20:26.220,00:20:28.624,What a shame she wouldn't comply.
00:20:29.180,00:20:32.340,乌拉那拉氏族还有多的是好姑娘,00:20:29.180,00:20:32.469,The Ula-Nara family does not lack suitable girls.
00:20:33.270,00:20:37.140,新的一拨长起来就没有她的事了,00:20:33.270,00:20:37.140,"Once the younger ones grow old enough,
there will be no place for her here."
00:20:37.520,00:20:38.760,那是格格不识台举,00:20:37.520,00:20:39.534,It's because she doesn't appreciate Your Majesty's favor.
00:20:39.860,00:20:42.270,还敢拿娘娘当年做侧福晋的事,00:20:39.860,00:20:43.400,"She even dared to remark on the fact that
Your Majesty was once a lord consort."
00:20:42.610,00:20:43.400,瞎嚷嚷呢,,,
00:20:43.700,00:20:44.480,好啊,00:20:43.700,00:20:44.780,Very well.
00:20:45.610,00:20:48.570,她喜欢嚷嚷本宫做侧福晋的事,00:20:45.610,00:20:48.570,"Since she likes to speak of my lord consortship,"
00:20:49.240,00:20:50.650,又看不上侍妾,00:20:49.240,00:20:51.200,"and also despises becoming a concubine,"
00:20:51.200,00:20:53.570,那本宫就台举她一回,00:20:51.200,00:20:53.687,then I will help her out once more.
00:20:54.420,00:20:57.750,让她知道做某些阿哥的侧福晋,00:20:54.420,00:21:00.702,"She will learn that being the lord consort of another prince
cannot compare to being a concubine of the Third Prince."
00:20:58.340,00:21:00.750,倒不如做三阿哥的侍妾,,,
00:21:01.380,00:21:02.620,娘娘您的意思是,00:21:01.380,00:21:02.620,Your Majesty means...
00:21:03.300,00:21:04.960,四阿哥也十六了,00:21:03.300,00:21:05.174,The Fourth Prince has turned sixteen.
00:21:05.470,00:21:07.210,本宫会去求皇上恩典,00:21:05.470,00:21:07.296,I will go and ask His Majesty
00:21:08.100,00:21:11.880,将青樱指给四阿哥为侧福晋,00:21:08.100,00:21:11.880,to betroth Qingying to the Fourth Prince as his lord consort.
00:21:12.680,00:21:14.340,那不是台举了四阿哥吗,00:21:12.680,00:21:14.400,Isn't that too flattering for the Fourth Prince?
00:21:14.600,00:21:15.260,台举,00:21:14.600,00:21:15.389,Flattering?
00:21:16.560,00:21:19.100,三阿哥看不上的人给了四阿哥,00:21:16.560,00:21:19.218,The Fourth Prince gets the Third Prince's cast-off.
00:21:19.520,00:21:21.350,熹贵妃又与本宫不睦,00:21:19.407,00:21:21.690,And Noble Consort Lumière is not on good terms with me.
00:21:21.690,00:21:23.180,添了这么个儿媳妇,00:21:21.690,00:21:23.948,Gaining such a daughter-in-law
00:21:23.570,00:21:25.400,是谁给谁添堵呢,00:21:23.948,00:21:25.664,will cause only trouble for her.
00:21:26.610,00:21:27.480,娘娘睿智,00:21:26.610,00:21:27.990,Your Highness has a discerning mind.
00:21:27.990,00:21:29.320,但奴婢有一事不明,00:21:27.990,00:21:29.600,But there is one thing I don't understand.
00:21:29.950,00:21:31.990,前朝已有人提出立太子之事,00:21:29.950,00:21:31.990,"The imperial court has already raised
 the need to establish a crown prince."
00:21:32.450,00:21:34.540,娘娘为何还让他们多提六阿哥,00:21:32.450,00:21:34.754,"Why did Your Majesty encourage them
to suggest the Sixth Prince?"
00:21:35.290,00:21:36.320,皇上多疑,00:21:35.290,00:21:36.622,His Majesty is distrustful.
00:21:36.790,00:21:39.750,最忌讳前朝后宫串通,00:21:36.790,00:21:41.894,"Any collusion between the court and the harem
 is strictly prohibited."
00:21:40.130,00:21:41.790,沆瀣一气之事,,,
00:21:42.710,00:21:46.170,咱们该时不时给皇上提个醒,00:21:42.710,00:21:46.170,We must often remind His Majesty of who is colluding.

00:21:54.230,00:21:57.510,这几年 朕总觉得身子大不如前了,00:21:53.913,00:21:57.655,"These past few years, I feel my health is nowhere near what it was."
00:21:59.020,00:22:01.980,皇后说要让弘时大婚,00:21:58.902,00:22:02.321,"The Empress wanted to find a wife for Hongshi,"
00:22:03.860,00:22:07.350,前朝又再提立太子一事,00:22:03.860,00:22:07.350,"and again, the imperial court brought up choosing a crown prince."
00:22:08.860,00:22:10.480,你不知道朕有多厌烦,00:22:08.860,00:22:10.669,You have no idea how fed up I am.
00:22:11.950,00:22:14.410,是不是这些大臣都觉得朕老了,00:22:11.950,00:22:14.410,Do all these officials think that I'm already so old
00:22:14.910,00:22:17.450,所以着急着要立太子了,00:22:14.910,00:22:17.450,that I must choose a crown prince now?
00:22:17.960,00:22:20.370,四郎年富力强 不必急于国本,00:22:17.960,00:22:19.427,"Si Lang, you are in your prime years."
,,,00:22:19.427,00:22:21.170,There's no rush to name a crown prince.
00:22:21.170,00:22:22.950,三阿哥再好也需再历练,00:22:21.170,00:22:22.950,The Third Prince is promising but he needs more experience.
00:22:23.840,00:22:26.580,前朝臣子只是担心四郎辛苦,00:22:23.840,00:22:26.883,The court officials are simply concerned about how hard you work.
00:22:27.090,00:22:28.170,想有人分忧罢了,00:22:27.034,00:22:29.378,They just wish someone could share the weight you carry.
00:22:31.260,00:22:32.670,纵然要立太子,00:22:31.260,00:22:33.013,"Even if I am to choose a crown prince,"
00:22:34.220,00:22:36.260,朕也等着咱们六阿哥呢,00:22:34.220,00:22:36.603,I want to wait for the Sixth Prince to grow up.
00:22:38.850,00:22:41.690,有些臣子是该急的不急,00:22:38.850,00:22:42.970,"Instead of worrying about what they should,
they worry over things they shouldn't."
00:22:41.940,00:22:42.970,不该急的瞎操心,,,
00:22:44.020,00:22:46.480,说起来四阿哥也十六了,00:22:44.020,00:22:46.720,"Speaking of which, the Fourth Prince has turned sixteen."
00:22:47.280,00:22:48.730,一提起三阿哥的婚事,,,
00:22:49.610,00:22:51.150,臣妾倒也惦记四阿哥的,00:22:47.280,00:22:51.493,"Speaking of the Third Prince's marriage
also has me thinking of the Fourth Prince's."
00:22:51.780,00:22:53.820,皇上 您可不许偏心啊,00:22:51.780,00:22:53.991,"Don't play favorites, Your Majesty."
00:22:54.330,00:22:56.660,你这话和皇后说的一样,00:22:54.330,00:22:56.660,You and the Empress are of the same mind.
00:22:57.660,00:23:01.000,皇后前日还说她有个外甥女青樱,00:22:57.660,00:23:02.960,"The Empress has brought up her niece Qingying.
She wants to betroth her to Hongli."
00:23:01.500,00:23:02.960,想指给弘历呢,,,
00:23:03.380,00:23:04.210,皇后偏心,00:23:03.380,00:23:04.731,Her Majesty is not being fair -
00:23:05.050,00:23:06.080,三阿哥不喜欢的,,,
00:23:06.380,00:23:07.540,就硬塞给咱们四阿哥,00:23:05.050,00:23:07.880,"shoving her to the Fourth Prince
because the Third Prince doesn't like her."
00:23:08.470,00:23:09.550,皇上上回还说呢,,,
00:23:09.880,00:23:11.250,已经看上了察哈尔总管,00:23:08.470,00:23:13.259,"Your Majesty said you had your eye on a girl surnamed Fuca,
daughter of Chahar's General Li."
00:23:11.680,00:23:13.010,荣宝家的女儿富察氏,,,
00:23:13.760,00:23:14.720,君无戏言啊,00:23:13.760,00:23:15.320,An emperor cannot take back his words.
00:23:16.520,00:23:18.550,朕知道你也喜欢富察氏,00:23:16.520,00:23:18.721,I know you also like Fuca.
00:23:18.980,00:23:20.890,富察氏比弘历还小一岁,00:23:18.980,00:23:20.890,"Although she is a year younger than Hongli,"
00:23:21.190,00:23:21.890,却也稳重,00:23:20.890,00:23:22.293,she has a stable personality.
00:23:22.860,00:23:25.560,可皇后说青樱只求侧福晋之位,00:23:22.860,00:23:25.731,But the Empress said Qingying only wants the title of Lord Consort.
00:23:26.820,00:23:29.930,皇后这样谦卑 朕也不好说什么了,00:23:26.820,00:23:29.930,Her request is a modest one so I didn't refuse it.
00:23:30.240,00:23:32.070,乌拉那拉氏乃是名门,00:23:30.240,00:23:32.490,The Ula-Nara clan is a prominent lineage.
00:23:32.490,00:23:35.450,臣妾是怕委屈了皇后的外甥女,00:23:32.490,00:23:36.007,I'm afraid Her Majesty's niece will feel aggrieved at this title.
00:23:36.240,00:23:37.480,皇后愿意,,,
00:23:38.660,00:23:41.240,朕也不能不给皇后这个面子,00:23:36.240,00:23:41.240,"The Empress was disposed towards it.
I will not make her lose face."
00:23:41.920,00:23:43.830,也好 这终究,00:23:41.920,00:23:45.660,Just as well. The Fourth Prince benefits from this after all.
00:23:44.170,00:23:45.660,是咱们四阿哥占了便宜去了,,,
00:23:48.420,00:23:50.790,今儿天气好 咱们出来走走,00:23:48.420,00:23:50.790,The weather is lovely today. Let's go for a stroll.
00:23:51.220,00:23:52.380,天天这么待着呀,,,
00:23:52.930,00:23:54.590,人非发了霉不可,00:23:51.220,00:23:54.590,"If we stay inside every day, we'll grow moldy before long!"
00:23:55.680,00:23:56.890,如今是九月了,00:23:55.680,00:23:57.104,It's already September.
00:23:57.310,00:23:58.470,你有没有让你宫里人,00:23:57.310,00:24:00.000,Did you have your servants collect willow branches for you?
00:23:58.850,00:23:59.760,替你折柳枝啊,,,
00:24:00.230,00:24:01.010,这是为何,00:24:00.230,00:24:01.010,What for?
00:24:02.020,00:24:04.760,柳同留是同音的 又在九月,00:24:02.020,00:24:05.360,"""Willow"" sounds like ""stay"", and the ""ninth"" month sounds like ""long."""
00:24:05.060,00:24:07.100,就是要皇上久留的意思,00:24:05.360,00:24:07.915,"It is a wish for His Majesty to ""stay long"" in your palace."
00:24:08.570,00:24:09.430,我不信这个,00:24:08.570,00:24:10.164,I don't believe in that kind of thing.
00:24:09.900,00:24:13.190,你现在正得宠 自然不信这些,00:24:10.164,00:24:13.190,"You're currently in favor,
that's why you don't believe in it!"
00:24:18.040,00:24:19.200,那不是王爷吗,00:24:18.040,00:24:19.520,Isn't that His Lordship?
00:24:21.040,00:24:21.870,果郡王,00:24:21.040,00:24:22.080,Noble Prince Guo.
00:24:31.090,00:24:32.330,许久不见王爷了,00:24:30.675,00:24:32.720,It's been so long since I last saw Your Lordship.
00:24:32.720,00:24:34.550,自从成亲有了家室之后,,,
00:24:35.180,00:24:37.540,王爷可不比以前逍遥自在了,00:24:32.720,00:24:37.540,"Since Your Lordship got married,
you can't be as carefree as in the past."
00:24:38.010,00:24:40.500,如今一左一右两位侧福晋,00:24:38.010,00:24:42.052,"With one lord consort on the left and another on the right,"
00:24:40.930,00:24:42.010,若架住了王爷,,,
00:24:42.480,00:24:44.890,可真是插翅也难逃啊,00:24:42.052,00:24:45.440,Your Lordship cannot escape even with wings!
00:24:46.610,00:24:47.970,敬贵妃总是那么风趣,00:24:46.610,00:24:48.545,Your Noble Highness is always so humorous.
00:24:49.360,00:24:50.100,许久未见,00:24:49.360,00:24:50.546,It's been a long time.
00:24:52.820,00:24:54.190,熹贵妃别来无恙,00:24:52.820,00:24:54.379,"Noble Consort Lumière, have you been well?"
00:24:56.950,00:24:57.940,劳王爷挂心,,,
00:24:58.660,00:24:59.740,本宫身体安康,00:24:56.950,00:25:00.000,"I thank Your Lordship for asking.
I'm in good health."
00:25:04.160,00:25:06.200,不知王爷今日为何入宫,00:25:04.160,00:25:06.200,What brings Your Lordship to the palace today?
00:25:06.920,00:25:07.530,久未进宫,,,
00:25:08.130,00:25:09.240,今日来向皇上请安,00:25:06.920,00:25:09.440,I'm here to pay my respects to His Majesty.
00:25:13.420,00:25:15.960,风大 王爷还是披上披风吧,00:25:13.420,00:25:16.174,"It's windy. Please put on your cloak, Your Lordship."
00:25:19.890,00:25:20.590,多谢,00:25:19.890,00:25:20.960,Thank you.
00:25:24.730,00:25:27.470,你我夫妻 王爷何必客气,00:25:24.730,00:25:27.599,"We're husband and wife -
 ""thank-you's"" are for strangers."
00:25:29.360,00:25:30.690,这位便是娴福晋吧,00:25:29.360,00:25:31.040,This must be Lord Consort Xian.
00:25:31.900,00:25:34.520,妾身果郡王侧福晋孟静娴,00:25:31.900,00:25:34.606,"I am Meng Jingxian, lord consort of Noble Prince Guo."
00:25:34.990,00:25:36.270,向熹贵妃请安,00:25:34.990,00:25:36.499,Peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:25:36.740,00:25:39.570,愿娘娘长乐未央 万福金安,00:25:36.944,00:25:40.280,I wish Your Highness eternal happiness and unending grace.
00:25:40.280,00:25:40.990,快请起,00:25:40.280,00:25:41.161,Please rise.
00:25:42.870,00:25:44.660,大婚那日娴福晋病着,00:25:42.870,00:25:44.660,You were ill on your wedding day
00:25:45.290,00:25:46.500,咱们原是第一次见,00:25:45.290,00:25:46.802,and this is my first time meeting you.
00:25:47.330,00:25:50.120,既是一家人 何须这样客气呢,00:25:47.330,00:25:50.120,"We're a family, there's no need to be so formal."
00:25:50.590,00:25:52.290,早该来向熹贵妃请安的,00:25:50.590,00:25:52.640,"I should have paid my respects to Your Noble Highness earlier,"
00:25:53.010,00:25:54.290,奈何身上一直不好,00:25:53.010,00:25:54.504,but my health hasn't allowed me.
00:25:55.340,00:25:57.210,所以今日与王爷一同入宫,00:25:55.340,00:25:57.767,"In fact, I came to the palace for two reasons today:"
00:25:58.300,00:25:59.540,是向皇上请安,00:25:58.300,00:26:00.320,To pay my respects to His Majesty
00:26:00.390,00:26:02.130,也是向各宫娘娘请罪,00:26:00.320,00:26:02.614,and to ask forgiveness of Your Highnesses.
00:26:03.470,00:26:05.970,本宫与皇上都挂念福晋身子,00:26:03.470,00:26:06.184,"Both His Majesty and I have been
thinking about Your Ladyship's health."
00:26:07.230,00:26:07.970,今日玉隐,,,
00:26:08.230,00:26:09.720,怎么没同来向皇上请安呢,00:26:07.230,00:26:10.199,"Why didn't Yuyin come along
to pay her respects to His Majesty today?"
00:26:10.690,00:26:11.640,真是没规矩,00:26:10.690,00:26:12.282,How she's forgotten the rules!
00:26:12.440,00:26:15.180,娴福晋既和玉隐一同服侍王爷,00:26:12.440,00:26:15.180,"Since Your Ladyship serves His Lordship alongside Yuyin,"
00:26:15.690,00:26:18.310,得闲时也要替本宫好好教导她,00:26:15.690,00:26:18.481,"please educate her on my behalf
when you have a chance."
00:26:19.160,00:26:20.860,今日田庄上来报节上的收成,00:26:19.160,00:26:21.120,"Today, the farming estates are reporting their harvest."
00:26:21.580,00:26:22.530,玉隐在府中料理,00:26:21.120,00:26:24.060,"Yuyin is attending to it, so she was unable to come."
00:26:22.910,00:26:23.770,所以就来不了了,,,
00:26:25.080,00:26:26.990,玉隐妹妹善于料理家事,00:26:25.080,00:26:27.430,Yuyin is so skillful with domestic matters.
00:26:28.080,00:26:30.410,不像我 身子不好,00:26:28.080,00:26:30.581,"Unlike me, with my ill health,"
00:26:31.500,00:26:32.790,只会拖累旁人,00:26:31.500,00:26:33.176,I'm only a burden to others.
00:26:36.010,00:26:37.040,福晋过虑了,00:26:36.010,00:26:37.460,Your Ladyship's worrying too much.
00:26:37.880,00:26:39.790,听闻娴福晋颇通诗书,00:26:37.880,00:26:40.000,I heard you're versed in poetry and literature.
00:26:40.340,00:26:41.500,怎能说是拖累呢,00:26:40.340,00:26:41.843,How can you be a burden?
00:26:44.100,00:26:46.340,静娴 你别多心了,00:26:44.100,00:26:46.340,"Jingxian, don't overthink."
00:26:49.350,00:26:51.560,玉隐妹妹是娘娘的义妹,00:26:49.350,00:26:51.560,Yuyin is Your Noble Highness's honorary sister.
00:26:52.150,00:26:54.390,娘娘若不嫌弃妾身愚笨,00:26:52.150,00:26:54.390,"If Your Noble Highness doesn't mind my dullness,"
00:26:55.280,00:26:57.560,只把妾身当妹妹看待好了,00:26:55.280,00:26:57.560,please see me like a younger sister as well.
00:26:58.860,00:27:00.850,福晋太台举本宫了,00:26:58.860,00:27:00.960,Your Lordship overly flatters me.
00:27:04.490,00:27:06.480,时候不早 别让皇上等着,00:27:04.490,00:27:06.888,It's getting late. We shouldn't leave His Majesty waiting.
00:27:10.290,00:27:14.080,果郡王待娴福晋果真是亲厚啊,00:27:10.290,00:27:14.622,Aiya! Your Lordship treats Lord Consort Xian so kindly.
00:27:14.750,00:27:17.340,绝不逊于熹贵妃妹妹的义妹啊,00:27:14.622,00:27:17.623,No less than how you treat Noble Consort Lumière's sister.
00:27:17.880,00:27:20.790,看来这一左一右两位侧福晋,00:27:17.880,00:27:22.466,"It seems the left- and right-hand consorts
are ""equally sharing the spring scenery."""
00:27:21.140,00:27:22.300,真是平分春色,,,
00:27:22.760,00:27:25.630,果郡王 你可真是多情啊,00:27:22.466,00:27:24.466,Your Lordship is really a loving husband.
00:27:29.690,00:27:30.390,告辞了,00:27:29.690,00:27:31.396,We shall take our leave.
00:27:39.900,00:27:41.640,宁嫔您才到 娘娘就回来了,00:27:39.839,00:27:42.648,"Just after Your Highness arrived,
Her Noble Highness has returned."
00:27:47.910,00:27:49.450,妹妹倒难得过来坐坐,00:27:47.910,00:27:50.000,"It's rare to see you here, Paix."
00:27:51.170,00:27:52.950,娘娘一向都这么多人伺候吗,00:27:51.170,00:27:53.869,Does Your Noble Highness always have so many servants around?
00:27:57.340,00:27:59.080,没事的话就都先下去吧,00:27:57.340,00:27:59.436,You may all leave if not on service.
00:28:00.550,00:28:01.380,御花园风冷,00:28:00.550,00:28:02.220,A cold wind blew through the imperial garden today.
00:28:02.220,00:28:03.830,怕娘娘的心口被冷着了,00:28:02.220,00:28:04.130,The chill could have entered Your Noble Highness's chest.
00:28:04.760,00:28:05.970,先喝口热茶吧,00:28:04.760,00:28:06.356,Quickly warm it with a sip of tea.
00:28:06.680,00:28:07.390,你见到了,00:28:06.680,00:28:07.822,You saw them too?
00:28:08.020,00:28:10.010,娴福晋痴情之名耳闻已久,00:28:08.020,00:28:10.310,I've long heard of Lord Consort Xian's devotion.
00:28:10.930,00:28:12.170,百闻不如一见嘛,00:28:10.930,00:28:12.707,"""Seeing is better than hearing a hundred times."""
00:28:14.270,00:28:16.180,妹妹又躲在哪儿看好戏呢,00:28:14.270,00:28:16.309,Where were you hiding to watch that show?
00:28:17.940,00:28:19.100,这做人辛苦,,,
00:28:20.150,00:28:21.560,到哪儿都得演戏,00:28:17.940,00:28:21.887,Life is tough. One always has to put on a show.
00:28:22.740,00:28:25.780,而这宫中更处处都是好戏,00:28:22.740,00:28:26.209,"But within this palace especially,
there are good shows everywhere you go."
00:28:27.030,00:28:29.740,你倒不认为娴福晋是逢场作戏,00:28:27.030,00:28:29.740,"So you think Lord Consort Xian
was just putting on an act?"
00:28:30.500,00:28:33.200,有些事你看着太假,00:28:30.500,00:28:34.860,"Some acts may appear fake, yet the feelings are true."
00:28:33.620,00:28:34.860,人家却是情真,,,
00:28:35.920,00:28:37.410,娘娘只不过看了一回,,,
00:28:37.710,00:28:38.830,便心下不舒服,00:28:35.920,00:28:39.259,"Your Highness feels uncomfortable
after seeing only one act of the show."
00:28:40.260,00:28:42.040,不知这娴福晋的痴情,,,
00:28:42.470,00:28:45.830,日日落在玉福晋眼里又是如何,00:28:40.260,00:28:45.830,"I wonder how Lord Consort Yu feels
seeing Xian's devotion day after day."
00:28:46.720,00:28:47.960,玉隐不是那样的人,00:28:46.720,00:28:48.089,Yuyin is not like that.
00:28:49.390,00:28:51.000,别小看了女人的嫉妒心,00:28:49.390,00:28:51.472,Don't underestimate the jealousy in a woman's heart.
00:28:52.640,00:28:53.680,自成婚以来,00:28:52.640,00:28:53.982,"Ever since their wedding,"
00:28:54.390,00:28:56.260,王爷只同玉福晋一同进宫,00:28:54.390,00:28:56.640,"Lord Consort Yu has been the one to
accompany His Lordship to the palace."
00:28:57.230,00:28:58.140,而现如今,,,
00:28:58.690,00:29:00.770,这娴福晋的身子有些好转,00:28:57.230,00:29:00.770,"But now that Lord Consort Xian has improved her health,"
00:29:01.820,00:29:05.060,只怕玉福晋料理家事之余,00:29:01.820,00:29:07.440,"I'm afraid Lord Consort Yu may finally  taste neglect
amidst managing all the estate affairs."
00:29:05.660,00:29:07.440,要一尝冷落滋味了,,,
00:29:07.700,00:29:10.030,不会 到底如今,00:29:07.700,00:29:08.745,She won't.
00:29:10.330,00:29:12.610,玉隐和娴福晋是平起平坐,00:29:09.122,00:29:12.610,"At the moment, they are on equal footings."
00:29:13.040,00:29:15.580,正因为平起平坐 势力平衡,00:29:13.040,00:29:16.051,"Precisely because of their equal and balanced status,"
00:29:16.630,00:29:18.540,王爷稍微对谁好一点,00:29:16.630,00:29:18.754,"if His Lordship shows more favor for one,"
00:29:19.590,00:29:22.120,另外一方若心胸狭窄起来,00:29:19.590,00:29:24.170,the neglected one could become narrow-minded and be unable to bear it.
00:29:22.510,00:29:24.170,势必不能相容,,,
00:29:26.090,00:29:28.080,王爷为什么要娶玉隐,00:29:26.090,00:29:28.509,Why His Lordship married Yuyin -
00:29:29.050,00:29:31.550,娘娘比我更心知肚明吧,00:29:29.237,00:29:31.752,Your Noble Highness knows better than I do.
00:29:32.980,00:29:34.060,那张小像,00:29:32.980,00:29:34.688,How could that little portrait
00:29:34.520,00:29:36.550,怎么会无故轻易掉出来呢,00:29:34.688,00:29:36.560,fall out easily for no reason?
00:29:38.190,00:29:40.400,王爷不是那么不谨慎的人,00:29:38.190,00:29:40.664,His Lordship is not a careless man.
00:29:42.990,00:29:43.940,木已成舟,00:29:42.990,00:29:44.466,"""The wood has been made into a boat."""
00:29:45.030,00:29:46.270,宁嫔应该明白,00:29:45.030,00:29:46.720,"Concubine Paix, you should understand"
00:29:47.030,00:29:48.900,握在手里的才是最可靠的,00:29:46.720,00:29:49.516,one can rely only on what they hold in their two hands.
00:29:50.120,00:29:51.070,只是你我,00:29:50.120,00:29:51.334,But you and I
00:29:51.540,00:29:53.490,一早便没了玉隐这样的机会,00:29:51.540,00:29:53.833,lost the chance to be in Yuyin's position a long time ago.
00:29:54.870,00:29:57.450,她虽是私心 却也无可厚非,00:29:54.870,00:29:58.222,"She acted in her own interest,
but that's understandable."
00:30:00.710,00:30:02.540,人不为己 天诛地灭,00:30:00.710,00:30:03.141,"""Heaven destroys those who don't act in their own interest."""
00:30:03.760,00:30:07.250,玉福晋别诛灭了自己的良心才好,00:30:03.760,00:30:07.679,Lord Consort Yu must not lose sight of her conscience.
00:30:08.760,00:30:10.090,我先回去养养精神,00:30:08.760,00:30:10.429,I'll go back and restore my energy.
00:30:11.050,00:30:13.510,日后怕是好戏不断,00:30:11.050,00:30:13.681,I'm sure there are endless good shows to come.
00:30:14.140,00:30:15.300,不能不看呢,00:30:14.140,00:30:15.429,I don't want to miss them.
00:30:18.150,00:30:18.930,先告辞了,00:30:18.150,00:30:19.266,I'll take my leave.
00:30:28.910,00:30:30.610,娘娘知道这宫中妃嫔,00:30:28.910,00:30:32.324,"Does Your Noble Highness know why
all the imperial concubines love to eat sweets?"
00:30:30.820,00:30:32.110,为何都爱吃甜食吗,,,
00:30:33.620,00:30:34.900,大约是心里苦,00:30:33.620,00:30:35.318,"For the bitterness in their hearts,"
00:30:35.500,00:30:36.990,只能吃些甜食来弥补,00:30:35.318,00:30:37.326,sweets are probably the only remedy.
00:30:38.080,00:30:39.450,那娘娘也多吃几颗,00:30:38.080,00:30:39.680,Then Your Highness should eat some more.
00:30:39.960,00:30:41.410,其实宁嫔的话,,,
00:30:41.790,00:30:43.330,倒真不必听进心里去,00:30:39.960,00:30:43.554,There is no need to take Concubine Paix's words to heart.
00:30:44.170,00:30:44.880,也是,00:30:44.170,00:30:45.051,That's true.
00:30:47.260,00:30:50.120,过两日玉隐就要进宫请安,00:30:47.260,00:30:50.334,Yuyin will visit the palace in a couple days.
00:30:51.090,00:30:53.010,你早些备下她喜欢的吃食吧,00:30:51.090,00:30:53.267,Be sure to prepare her favorite snacks in advance.
00:30:53.720,00:30:54.300,好,00:30:53.720,00:30:54.300,Yes.
00:31:05.400,00:31:06.060,贵人,00:31:05.400,00:31:06.619,Noble Lady.
00:31:07.030,00:31:07.770,三阿哥,00:31:07.030,00:31:08.092,Third Prince.
00:31:09.910,00:31:11.190,你应该叫我瑛娘娘,00:31:09.910,00:31:11.190,You should address me the same way as other concubines.
00:31:11.780,00:31:12.520,只有你我在,00:31:11.780,00:31:13.120,It's just the two of us.
00:31:17.290,00:31:18.200,瑛娘娘万福,00:31:17.290,00:31:18.734,Peace to Your Highness.
00:31:20.040,00:31:20.870,你先下去吧,,,
00:31:21.250,00:31:21.830,是,00:31:20.040,00:31:22.295,"- You may go now.
- Yes."
00:31:27.920,00:31:29.210,三阿哥有什么话说,00:31:27.920,00:31:29.786,"Third Prince, do you have something to tell me?"
00:31:30.340,00:31:32.170,我把你弹的那首高山流水,00:31:30.340,00:31:33.798,"I added lyrics to your ""High Mountain and Flowing Water""."
00:31:32.640,00:31:34.840,改成了唱曲 你听见了吗,00:31:33.798,00:31:35.268,Have you heard my version yet?
00:31:36.390,00:31:37.600,三阿哥不要这么说,00:31:36.390,00:31:38.056,"Third Prince, please don't talk about that!"
00:31:38.310,00:31:40.010,要是皇上知道你不务正业,00:31:38.310,00:31:40.390,"If His Majesty knows you are not focused on your studies,"
00:31:40.390,00:31:41.260,又要责骂你了,00:31:40.390,00:31:41.780,he will scold you again.
00:31:44.400,00:31:45.180,我就知道,00:31:44.400,00:31:45.341,I knew it.
00:31:45.520,00:31:47.640,这宫里只有你关心我,00:31:45.520,00:31:48.025,"In this palace, you're the only one who cares about me."
00:31:48.240,00:31:48.850,明白我,00:31:48.025,00:31:49.740,Only you understand me.
00:31:49.740,00:31:50.850,三阿哥 你要做什么,00:31:49.740,00:31:51.236,"Third Prince, what are you doing?"
00:31:51.450,00:31:52.310,我是你的庶母,00:31:51.236,00:31:52.929,I am your father's concubine!
00:31:53.620,00:31:54.730,我知道你对我好,00:31:53.620,00:31:54.843,You are good to me!
00:31:55.200,00:31:55.910,我不在乎名分地位的,,,
00:31:56.160,00:31:57.070,三阿哥退下,00:31:54.843,00:31:57.213,"- I don't care about the title or status!
- Stay back!"
00:31:58.580,00:32:00.070,我就那么比不上皇阿玛吗,00:31:58.580,00:32:00.204,Am I nothing next to my Imperial Father?!
00:32:00.500,00:32:01.990,我心里有你 皇阿玛他老了,00:32:00.500,00:32:02.637,"I have you in my heart!
He's already an old man!"
00:32:13.140,00:32:14.090,今儿是怎么了,00:32:13.140,00:32:14.470,What's going on today?
00:32:14.470,00:32:16.010,这瑛贵人慌了慌张的,00:32:14.470,00:32:16.731,Noble Lady Lustré looks flustered
00:32:16.850,00:32:18.960,这三阿哥也跟丢了魂似的,00:32:16.731,00:32:20.960,and the Third Prince seems as if he's lost his soul.
00:32:19.560,00:32:20.550,撞了鬼了,,,
00:32:21.060,00:32:22.640,这两个人都血气方刚的,00:32:21.060,00:32:23.020,Their blood and qi are so firey.
00:32:23.020,00:32:23.720,怕是,00:32:23.020,00:32:24.210,I'm afraid they...
00:32:24.900,00:32:25.980,我说呢,00:32:24.633,00:32:26.247,No wonder...
00:32:26.610,00:32:28.470,前两天让歌伎排曲子,,,
00:32:29.190,00:32:30.180,听见有人在唱,00:32:26.610,00:32:32.000,"I heard the performers rehearsing a lyric version of
Noble Lady Lustré's ""High Mountain and Flowing Water."""
00:32:30.570,00:32:32.150,瑛贵人弹的高山流水,,,
00:32:32.610,00:32:33.940,好像是三阿哥找人,,,
00:32:34.360,00:32:36.480,按瑛贵人那个筝的曲子排的,00:32:32.610,00:32:36.480,"It seems that the Third Prince ordered it
based on Lady Lustré's melody."
00:32:36.990,00:32:37.950,您是说,00:32:36.990,00:32:38.290,Your Highness is saying...
00:32:38.290,00:32:40.650,现在三阿哥是皇后的养子,00:32:38.290,00:32:40.864,The Third Prince is the foster son of the Empress.
00:32:41.460,00:32:43.040,皇后又是他的额娘,00:32:41.460,00:32:43.169,The Empress is his mother.
00:32:44.420,00:32:45.700,这事关重大,00:32:44.420,00:32:46.234,This is a serious matter.
00:32:47.290,00:32:48.160,找人留意着,00:32:47.290,00:32:48.687,Have someone keep an eye out.
00:32:49.000,00:32:49.620,是,00:32:49.000,00:32:50.000,Yes.
00:32:52.050,00:32:53.880,你在我这儿已经待了好几日了,00:32:52.050,00:32:54.103,You've already stayed here for a few days.
00:32:55.090,00:32:57.680,你再不回去 王爷会担心的,00:32:55.090,00:32:58.259,His Lordship will worry if you don't return soon.
00:32:58.930,00:33:00.800,王爷待孟静娴比待我亲近,00:32:58.930,00:33:01.290,His Lordship treats Meng Jingxian better than me
00:33:02.060,00:33:04.090,府里的人也竟渐渐势利了起来,00:33:01.882,00:33:04.160,and the servants have become snobbish.
00:33:05.690,00:33:06.720,回去也没什么意思,00:33:05.690,00:33:07.360,I see no point in going back.
00:33:08.940,00:33:11.400,娘娘 果郡王府的娴福晋来了,00:33:08.940,00:33:12.000,"Your Highness, Lord Consort Xian is here
from Noble Prince Guo's estate."
00:33:12.860,00:33:15.270,说是来给娘娘请安的,00:33:12.826,00:33:15.771,She said she wishes to pay respects to Your Highness.
00:33:16.530,00:33:17.940,说曹操曹操就到,00:33:16.530,00:33:17.940,"""Speak of Cao Cao and he arrives""."
00:33:18.490,00:33:20.280,可见背后不能说人,00:33:18.490,00:33:20.490,It's true that we can't talk about others behind their back.
00:33:20.490,00:33:21.700,长姐 我不愿意见她,00:33:20.490,00:33:22.101,"Elder sister, I don't want to see her."
00:33:22.450,00:33:23.280,平时在府里,,,
00:33:23.540,00:33:24.780,已经看够了她缠着王爷了,00:33:22.450,00:33:25.420,I've already seen enough of her fawning over His Lordship.
00:33:25.420,00:33:27.200,想躲到这儿避开她 得些清净,00:33:25.420,00:33:27.495,That's why I'm here - to avoid her and have some quiet!
00:33:27.540,00:33:28.370,竟也不能如愿,00:33:27.495,00:33:29.122,Why can't I just have some peace?
00:33:29.540,00:33:30.450,眼不见为净,00:33:29.540,00:33:30.931,"""What one doesn't see brings one peace."""
00:33:31.300,00:33:33.130,你去那边躲着 我来打发她,00:33:31.300,00:33:33.575,Go hide over there. I'll handle her.
00:33:35.550,00:33:36.340,去请,00:33:35.097,00:33:36.963,"-Your Highness.
- Show her in."
00:33:49.900,00:33:51.560,熹贵妃娘娘吉祥,00:33:49.900,00:33:51.826,Peace to Noble Consort Lumière.
00:33:53.150,00:33:53.770,起来吧,00:33:53.150,00:33:54.123,Rise.
00:33:55.530,00:33:56.190,坐,00:33:55.406,00:33:56.457,Have a seat.
00:33:57.700,00:34:00.560,今日怎么得空来坐坐,00:33:57.700,00:34:01.139,What brings you here to visit today?
00:34:02.580,00:34:04.240,冈j才过来给皇上请安,00:34:02.580,00:34:04.466,I came to pay my respects to His Majesty
00:34:04.700,00:34:05.910,顺便看望娘娘,00:34:04.700,00:34:06.266,and decided to visit Your Highness as well.
00:34:06.870,00:34:08.990,对了 听闻玉隐妹妹,00:34:06.870,00:34:10.846,I heard Yuyin has been staying here for the last few days.
00:34:09.330,00:34:10.490,这两日住在娘娘这儿,,,
00:34:11.710,00:34:13.250,怎么没瞧见她人呢,00:34:11.710,00:34:13.740,But I don't see her around.
00:34:14.550,00:34:17.760,真是不巧 她去了敬贵妃那儿,00:34:14.550,00:34:17.894,You just missed her; she just left to visit Noble Consort Estime.
00:34:18.130,00:34:20.250,说要给胧月公主裁制衣裳,00:34:18.130,00:34:20.829,She wants to sew some clothes for Princess Longyue.
00:34:22.140,00:34:24.050,玉隐妹妹很喜欢孩子呢,00:34:22.140,00:34:24.406,Yuyin is so fond of children.
00:34:25.560,00:34:26.300,喝杯茶,00:34:25.560,00:34:26.879,Have some tea.
00:34:35.190,00:34:36.680,娘娘的茶好香啊,00:34:35.190,00:34:37.026,Your Highness's tea is so fragrant.
00:34:37.650,00:34:39.440,只是妾身不宜饮茶,00:34:37.650,00:34:40.000,But my condition makes tea unsuitable for me.
00:34:40.200,00:34:42.860,否则真想品一品这好茶,00:34:40.200,00:34:42.860,"Otherwise, I would love to savor this fine tea."
00:34:43.370,00:34:45.610,怎么 娴福晋身子不适吗,00:34:43.370,00:34:45.781,What's wrong? Is Your Ladyship unwell?
00:34:46.330,00:34:47.110,太医说,00:34:46.330,00:34:47.696,The imperial doctor said
00:34:48.330,00:34:50.240,妾身有了一个月的身孕,00:34:48.330,00:34:50.240,that I am one month pregnant.
00:34:51.040,00:34:52.030,胎气未稳,00:34:51.040,00:34:52.790,"My prenatal qi is not stable yet,"
00:34:52.790,00:34:55.080,所以暂时不宜饮茶,00:34:52.790,00:34:55.080,so I shouldn't drink tea for now.
00:35:05.140,00:35:06.600,这毛丫头是刚入宫的,00:35:05.140,00:35:06.890,This careless maid is new to the palace.
00:35:06.890,00:35:07.760,毛手毛脚的,,,
00:35:08.060,00:35:09.340,连个衣架子都不会擦,00:35:06.890,00:35:09.600,So clumsy she can't even clean a dress rack properly.
00:35:09.890,00:35:10.800,惊了娘娘了,00:35:09.890,00:35:11.140,Sorry to disturb Your Highness.
00:35:15.980,00:35:17.020,你这丫头怎么回事,00:35:15.980,00:35:17.209,What's wrong with you?
00:35:17.400,00:35:18.640,弄倒了架子还不快扶起来,00:35:17.400,00:35:18.640,Hold the rack up now!
00:35:19.280,00:35:21.440,不许哭 二位娘娘还在外面呢,00:35:19.280,00:35:21.529,Stop crying. Her Highness and Her Ladyship are out there.
00:35:21.820,00:35:22.810,免得扰了娘娘,00:35:21.820,00:35:23.024,Don't disturb them.
00:35:32.710,00:35:33.820,那当真是大喜,00:35:32.710,00:35:34.080,That is wonderful news.
00:35:36.130,00:35:38.750,丫头不懂事 也是奴婢管教无方,00:35:36.130,00:35:38.921,I failed to discipline the maids well.
00:35:39.220,00:35:40.550,还请福晋恕罪呢,00:35:39.220,00:35:40.640,"Please forgive me, Your Ladyship."
00:35:40.970,00:35:43.330,新来的丫头都有些毛手毛脚的,00:35:40.970,00:35:43.501,New maids are usually careless.
00:35:44.100,00:35:46.210,我们府里多亏了玉隐妹妹能干,00:35:44.100,00:35:46.570,Our estate is orderly all thanks to Yuyin's abilities.
00:35:46.810,00:35:47.800,若换做妾身,00:35:46.810,00:35:48.057,"If it was me,"
00:35:48.390,00:35:49.930,怎么能看得住下人呢,00:35:48.390,00:35:50.457,I wouldn't be capable of supervising the servants.
00:35:50.980,00:35:51.930,玉隐再能干,,,
00:35:52.810,00:35:53.930,也不及娴福晋,00:35:50.980,00:35:53.967,"Yuyin is competent, but that doesn't compare"
00:35:54.270,00:35:55.890,为果郡王诞育世子的功劳,00:35:53.967,00:35:56.674,to your contribution of bearing His Lordship's heir.
00:35:58.030,00:35:59.860,自妾身嫁入王府以来,00:35:58.030,00:36:00.320,"Since I married into the family,"
00:36:00.570,00:36:01.430,一直听闻,00:36:00.570,00:36:01.601,I have always heard
00:36:02.110,00:36:04.730,王爷钟情玉隐妹妹多年,00:36:02.110,00:36:04.730,that His Lordship has loved Yuyin for years.
00:36:05.580,00:36:06.740,才纳入王府,00:36:05.580,00:36:07.040,That was why he married her.
00:36:08.410,00:36:10.370,玉隐对王爷情深意重,00:36:08.410,00:36:10.370,Yuyin is deeply devoted to His Lordship.
00:36:11.080,00:36:13.740,自然 福晋对王爷也是如此,00:36:11.080,00:36:13.740,"Just as Your Ladyship is to His Lordship, as well."
00:36:16.130,00:36:19.710,王爷对妾身只有同情而已,00:36:16.130,00:36:19.710,His Lordship has only sympathy towards me.
00:36:21.380,00:36:23.340,也只有妾身自己知道,00:36:21.380,00:36:23.469,And I'm the only one who knows
00:36:23.840,00:36:26.630,腹中的孩子是怎么得来的,00:36:23.840,00:36:26.630,how this pregnancy came about.
00:36:27.560,00:36:28.890,因为只有有了孩子,00:36:27.560,00:36:29.120,Because only with a child
00:36:29.310,00:36:32.520,才能让王爷的心居留在妾身身上,00:36:29.310,00:36:32.520,will His Lordship's heart dwell with mine.
00:36:33.940,00:36:35.550,可是近日妾身发现,00:36:33.940,00:36:35.776,But recently I discovered
00:36:36.820,00:36:39.400,玉隐也是这般努力地投其所好,00:36:36.820,00:36:39.589,that Yuyin is also going to great lengths to please His Lordship.
00:36:40.110,00:36:42.100,若是王爷真如外界所传,00:36:40.110,00:36:44.400,"If His Lordship and Yuyin are as deeply in love as everyone says,"
00:36:42.450,00:36:43.940,与玉隐妹妹两情相悦,,,
00:36:44.490,00:36:46.400,她又何须这般费力讨好,00:36:44.480,00:36:46.720,why does she need to try so hard to please him?
00:36:48.540,00:36:50.030,福晋既已嫁入王府,00:36:48.540,00:36:50.201,"Since Your Ladyship has married into the family,"
00:36:51.080,00:36:52.030,本宫倒不妨,,,
00:36:52.370,00:36:53.780,把自己在宫中多年的经验,00:36:51.080,00:36:55.040,I would like to share my years of experience in the harem.
00:36:54.080,00:36:54.870,讲与你听,,,

00:36:58.880,00:37:01.210,很多事你越多想 越易生事,00:36:58.880,00:37:01.440,"The deeper you think, the more trouble you may cause."
00:37:02.050,00:37:04.290,不多虑的才是聪明人,00:37:02.050,00:37:04.290,Those who don't overthink are the wise ones.
00:37:08.260,00:37:09.130,但愿如此,00:37:08.260,00:37:09.319,So I hope.
00:37:10.520,00:37:13.880,可是妾身实在参不透里面的原委,00:37:10.520,00:37:13.880,But I really can't work out what is the truth.
00:37:14.310,00:37:15.050,本宫说了,00:37:14.310,00:37:15.307,"As I said,"
00:37:15.850,00:37:17.720,女闲福晋是孕中多思了,00:37:15.850,00:37:17.871,you are thinking too much due to your pregnancy.
00:37:18.570,00:37:21.020,如今妾身是王爷枕边人,00:37:18.570,00:37:21.492,"Now that I share the pillow with His Lordship,"
00:37:21.860,00:37:24.350,许多事 除了枕边人,00:37:21.860,00:37:27.608,I can see many things that others cannot.
00:37:25.660,00:37:27.490,外人是瞧不出来的,,,
00:37:28.200,00:37:30.360,夫妇之道 这是应当的,00:37:28.200,00:37:30.531,As it should be. This is the nature of marriage.
00:37:37.790,00:37:38.870,妾身告退,00:37:37.790,00:37:39.096,I should take my leave.
00:37:54.560,00:37:55.770,孟静娴她太聪明了,00:37:54.560,00:37:56.077,Meng Jingxian is too smart.
00:37:56.940,00:37:59.430,她的猜忌迟早会害了王爷的,00:37:56.940,00:37:59.581,One day her suspicions will harm His Lordship.
00:38:00.400,00:38:01.390,她深爱王爷,00:38:00.400,00:38:02.030,She loves His Lordship deeply.
00:38:02.030,00:38:03.520,会以王爷的利益为重的,00:38:02.030,00:38:03.831,She will put his well-being first.
00:38:05.700,00:38:07.360,只是她现在有了王爷的孩子,00:38:05.700,00:38:08.191,"But now she is pregnant with His Lordship's child,"
00:38:08.620,00:38:11.360,我在这王府还有什么立足之地,00:38:08.620,00:38:11.752,where is there room for me in the estate?
00:38:13.790,00:38:14.900,孟静娴腹中,00:38:13.790,00:38:15.320,Meng Jingxian's unborn child
00:38:15.370,00:38:17.160,才是王爷名正言顺的孩子,00:38:15.370,00:38:17.160,is His Lordship's rightful heir.
00:38:18.500,00:38:20.240,你也是这孩子名义上的母亲,00:38:18.500,00:38:20.240,You are the child's mother in name.
00:38:20.840,00:38:22.170,自然有你立足之地,00:38:20.840,00:38:22.482,Of course there is room for you.
00:38:23.300,00:38:24.880,你是钮佑禄家的二小姐,00:38:23.300,00:38:25.120,"You are the second daughter of our Niohuru family,"
00:38:25.300,00:38:26.710,果郡王的侧福晋,00:38:25.300,00:38:27.084,and the lord consort of Noble Prince Guo.
00:38:27.300,00:38:28.460,应当贤良淑德,00:38:27.300,00:38:28.803,Your virtue should befit your status.
00:38:33.930,00:38:35.050,我既深爱王爷,00:38:33.930,00:38:35.430,I love His Lordship deeply
00:38:36.430,00:38:38.020,自然不会亏待了他的孩子,00:38:36.430,00:38:38.240,and I will naturally treat his child well.
00:38:40.560,00:38:41.390,只是长姐,00:38:40.560,00:38:41.798,"But Elder Sister,"
00:38:43.730,00:38:44.810,我心里苦啊,00:38:43.730,00:38:45.165,my heart is bitter.
00:38:49.490,00:38:50.980,从前之事皆不重要,00:38:49.490,00:38:51.389,What happened in the past is of no importance.
00:38:52.030,00:38:53.150,重要的是眼下,00:38:52.030,00:38:53.503,The present is what matters.
00:38:54.540,00:38:55.990,皇上器重孟静娴,00:38:54.540,00:38:56.161,His Majesty holds Meng Jingxian in high regard
00:38:57.290,00:38:59.370,这又是果郡王府的第一个孩子,00:38:57.290,00:38:59.370,and this is the firstborn to the estate.
00:39:00.920,00:39:02.200,你一定要照顾好她,00:39:00.920,00:39:02.400,"You ought to take good care of her,"
00:39:02.750,00:39:03.830,断不可有闪失,00:39:02.750,00:39:04.084,and let no harm come to her.
00:39:07.510,00:39:09.090,我欲与君相知,00:39:07.510,00:39:09.304,"""I shall be known and loved by you"""

00:39:21.860,00:39:24.600,三阿哥 我听您念叨这几句诗,00:39:21.860,00:39:23.011,"Third Prince,"
00:39:24.980,00:39:26.310,已经念叨好几天了,00:39:23.011,00:39:26.733,I've been hearing you reciting these lines for days now.
00:39:27.820,00:39:28.520,小乐子,00:39:27.820,00:39:28.691,"Xiao-Lezi,"
00:39:31.450,00:39:32.230,我不好吗,00:39:31.450,00:39:32.570,am I unworthy?
00:39:32.570,00:39:33.910,好啊 怎么不好了,00:39:32.570,00:39:33.910,Quite the opposite. Why?
00:39:34.330,00:39:35.660,您是天之骄子啊,00:39:34.330,00:39:35.849,You are the pride of Heaven.
00:39:36.120,00:39:37.360,天之骄子有什么用,00:39:36.120,00:39:37.586,What's the point of being Heaven's pride?
00:39:38.750,00:39:39.950,真正关心我的,00:39:38.750,00:39:40.264,There is only one person
00:39:41.420,00:39:42.330,只有她一个人,00:39:41.420,00:39:42.560,who cares about me.
00:39:42.960,00:39:43.700,谁啊,00:39:42.960,00:39:44.000,Who?
00:39:46.250,00:39:49.210,你说我是满心满肺的话,00:39:46.250,00:39:49.424,"Look, words are filling up my heart and lungs"
00:39:50.220,00:39:51.880,我不知道怎么跟她说才好啊,00:39:50.220,00:39:52.069,but I don't know how to tell them to her.
00:39:52.470,00:39:55.080,主子 不能说那就写吧,00:39:52.470,00:39:55.294,"Master, if you can't speak, why not write?"
00:39:58.310,00:39:59.090,还是你聪明,00:39:58.310,00:39:59.536,Aren't you clever!
00:40:24.790,00:40:27.530,你皇额娘召你去是为了什么事,00:40:24.790,00:40:27.830,What did your Imperial Mother summon you for?
00:40:28.800,00:40:30.210,皇额娘说儿子年纪大了,00:40:28.800,00:40:30.467,"Imperial Mother said now that I've come of age,"
00:40:31.010,00:40:32.170,皇阿玛要给儿子指婚,00:40:31.010,00:40:32.608,Father will arrange a marriage for me.
00:40:33.010,00:40:36.090,富察氏是个好孩子 额娘很放心,00:40:33.010,00:40:35.200,The girl surnamed Fuca is a fine lady.
,,,00:40:35.275,00:40:36.684,I have faith in her.
00:40:36.470,00:40:37.710,儿子相信额娘的眼光,00:40:36.684,00:40:38.080,"I trust your judgment, Mother."
00:40:38.310,00:40:40.670,只是儿子年幼 有福晋就够了,00:40:38.310,00:40:40.970,"But I am still young, and having a primary wife will be enough."
00:40:41.310,00:40:42.920,可皇额娘还要将乌拉那拉氏,00:40:41.310,00:40:44.480,"Yet Imperial Mother wishes me to also take
the lady surnamed Ula-Nara as my lord consort."
00:40:43.310,00:40:44.300,指给儿子为侧福晋,,,
00:40:45.150,00:40:47.430,额娘可知道 那乌拉那拉氏是,00:40:45.150,00:40:47.430,"Mother, have you heard she is..."
00:40:47.690,00:40:48.600,额娘都知道,00:40:47.430,00:40:48.642,I know it all.
00:40:50.110,00:40:52.350,皇后要你娶 你便娶吧,00:40:50.110,00:40:52.607,"Since Her Majesty requested, you should agree."
00:40:53.280,00:40:54.860,无谓为这些小事得罪她,00:40:53.280,00:40:55.256,There's no need to offend her over a trifle.
00:40:55.870,00:40:57.280,可是那是三哥不要的人,00:40:55.870,00:40:57.830,But she was rejected by my third brother.
00:40:57.830,00:40:59.280,三哥不要的人却给我,00:40:57.830,00:40:59.354,Assigning her to me...
00:41:01.250,00:41:03.200,三阿哥不要 你却收容她,00:41:01.250,00:41:03.289,"The Third Prince rejected her, but you will accommodate her."
00:41:03.540,00:41:04.570,那才是你的大度,00:41:03.540,00:41:05.026,That only shows your generosity.
00:41:05.750,00:41:08.490,三阿哥纵情任性 正好成全了你,00:41:05.750,00:41:08.490,Your brother's willful action will now do you a favor.
00:41:09.880,00:41:11.240,不过是个侧福晋,00:41:09.880,00:41:11.583,She will be merely a lord consort.
00:41:11.840,00:41:14.210,你娶回去好吃好喝地待着就是了,00:41:11.840,00:41:14.210,Just marry her and keep her well provided for at home.
00:41:14.970,00:41:16.830,又没有人逼你和她举案齐眉,00:41:14.970,00:41:17.238,No one is asking you to bow like a maid and serve her.
00:41:17.930,00:41:18.590,是,00:41:17.930,00:41:18.761,Yes.
00:41:19.390,00:41:20.850,你若真不喜欢青樱,00:41:19.390,00:41:21.107,"If you really dislike Qingying,"
00:41:21.560,00:41:23.140,额娘已经替你看好了一位,00:41:21.560,00:41:23.360,I have one more candidate in mind.
00:41:24.140,00:41:26.630,照顾你的高氏 温柔贤淑,00:41:24.140,00:41:27.187,"The lady surnamed Gao who's been taking care of you -
She's gentle and virtuous."
00:41:27.860,00:41:29.440,额娘也知道你中意她,00:41:27.860,00:41:29.440,I also know that you like her.
00:41:30.570,00:41:31.560,等再过两年,00:41:30.570,00:41:31.903,Wait a couple years
00:41:32.320,00:41:33.480,额娘让你皇阿玛,00:41:32.320,00:41:33.780,and I will request His Majesty
00:41:33.780,00:41:35.360,照样赐给你做侧福晋,00:41:33.780,00:41:35.617,to decree her to be your Lord Consort.
00:41:35.820,00:41:38.230,是 额娘替儿子筹谋,00:41:35.820,00:41:38.230,"Mother, you've been thinking for me."
00:41:38.700,00:41:39.690,儿子懂得大局,00:41:38.700,00:41:40.160,I understand the bigger picture
00:41:40.490,00:41:41.820,一定不会让额娘为难,00:41:40.490,00:41:42.120,and won't make things difficult for Mother.
00:41:42.950,00:41:43.610,那就好,00:41:42.950,00:41:43.910,That's good.
00:41:45.420,00:41:46.400,给娘娘请安,00:41:45.420,00:41:46.626,Peace to Your Highness.
