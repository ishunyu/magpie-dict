00:02:21.480,00:02:21.990,往右一点,,,
00:02:22.280,00:02:22.750,往右啊,,,
00:02:23.040,00:02:24.070,再过来一点 过来过来,00:02:22.460,00:02:23.720,"- A bit to the right.
- To the right?"
00:02:24.480,00:02:24.750,往左一点,00:02:23.980,00:02:25.280,"A bit more, keep going."
00:02:24.960,00:02:25.190,左,,,
00:02:25.400,00:02:26.110,再往左一点点,00:02:25.380,00:02:26.860,"- Now a bit to the left.
- Left?"
00:02:26.280,00:02:26.590,行吗,,,
00:02:26.800,00:02:27.710,好 好 就这样,00:02:26.900,00:02:28.660,"- Is that good?
- Yes, that's it."
00:02:29.000,00:02:30.870,这幅画就只配放在我们碎玉轩,00:02:29.900,00:02:31.560,Only our palace deserves to have this.
00:02:31.080,00:02:32.390,放在其他地方都不合适,00:02:32.060,00:02:33.580,It doesn't belong anywhere else.
00:02:33.280,00:02:35.660,阿弥陀佛 皇上写一回就罢了,00:02:33.860,00:02:35.100,"Amitābha Buddha,"
00:02:36.000,00:02:36.950,这要多写几回,00:02:35.300,00:02:37.940,it's okay if His Majesty only writes this once.
00:02:37.720,00:02:39.070,难为我这歪脖子了,00:02:38.600,00:02:40.140,It's so hard on my stiff neck!
00:02:41.560,00:02:42.670,给莞嫔娘娘请安,,,
00:02:43.440,00:02:44.630,你怎么这么着急进来,00:02:42.560,00:02:43.980,Peace to Your Highness.
00:02:44.960,00:02:46.310,师傅叫奴才赶紧来请娘娘,00:02:44.420,00:02:45.720,Why did you come in such a hurry?
00:02:46.600,00:02:47.310,去一趟养心殿,00:02:46.000,00:02:48.220,"My Shifu sent me here to bring Your Highness
to the Hall of Mental Cultivation immediately."
00:02:47.480,00:02:48.030,怎么了,,,
00:02:48.520,00:02:49.580,皇上生气了,00:02:48.400,00:02:49.300,What happened?
00:02:50.440,00:02:51.190,浣碧 备轿,00:02:49.500,00:02:50.820,His Majesty is angry.
,,,00:02:51.380,00:02:52.880,"Jade, prepare the sedan chair."
00:02:53.120,00:02:54.230,落轿,00:02:54.080,00:02:55.480,Put down the sedan chair.
00:03:00.800,00:03:02.470,娘娘您可来了,00:03:01.380,00:03:03.240,Your Highness is finally here.
00:03:02.920,00:03:04.510,皇上发了好大的脾气,,,
00:03:04.760,00:03:06.070,把奴才们都轰出来了,00:03:04.020,00:03:05.520,His Majesty was infuriated
00:03:06.560,00:03:07.620,娘娘 拜托您,00:03:05.720,00:03:07.140,and turned all of us out.
00:03:08.080,00:03:09.220,进去好歹劝一劝,00:03:07.540,00:03:10.120,"Your Highness, please, calm His Majesty down at least."
00:03:09.800,00:03:11.110,奴才们感激不尽哪,,,
00:03:11.280,00:03:11.910,出什么事了,00:03:10.720,00:03:12.000,We will be eternally grateful.
,,,00:03:12.000,00:03:13.220,What happened?
00:03:12.760,00:03:15.220,似乎是为了敦亲王的奏章,00:03:13.640,00:03:16.240,It seems to be a memorandum from State Prince Dun.
00:03:15.680,00:03:17.030,你可知道奏章上写了什么,00:03:16.640,00:03:18.300,Do you know what the memorandum was for?
00:03:17.880,00:03:20.070,好像是请封的奏章,00:03:18.740,00:03:21.200,It seems to be asking for a promotion.
00:03:20.880,00:03:22.430,敦亲王太过人心不足了,,,
00:03:22.840,00:03:23.870,才封了他一双儿女,00:03:21.820,00:03:23.720,"""An insatiable snake would try to swallow an elephant."""
00:03:24.200,00:03:25.110,转眼又要来请封,00:03:23.800,00:03:25.000,His son and daughter have just been promoted.
00:03:25.520,00:03:26.740,奴才也这么说呀,00:03:25.120,00:03:26.500,And he wants even more in the blink of an eye.
,,,00:03:26.600,00:03:27.940,I agree with Your Highness.
00:03:27.440,00:03:29.590,皇上若不肯大可把奏章退回去,00:03:28.460,00:03:30.620,"His Majesty could return the memorandum
if he disapproves."
00:03:30.280,00:03:31.990,皇上从来不是性子暴躁的人啊,00:03:31.180,00:03:32.900,He is never an impetuous person.
00:03:32.200,00:03:32.950,是啊,,,
00:03:33.240,00:03:33.910,放肆,00:03:33.160,00:03:33.920,Exactly.
,,,00:03:34.120,00:03:35.320,How dare you!
00:03:36.920,00:03:37.590,娘娘,00:03:37.880,00:03:38.880,Your Highness.
00:03:42.480,00:03:44.990,皇上喝盏茶可以平平肝火,00:03:43.480,00:03:46.020,"Your Majesty, the tea can relieve the heat in the Liver."
00:03:46.120,00:03:49.070,你怎么不问问朕为什么生气,00:03:47.140,00:03:49.900,Why don't you ask me what I'm angry about?
00:03:49.720,00:03:50.780,等皇上气消了,00:03:50.640,00:03:51.960,"When Your Majesty calms down,"
00:03:51.120,00:03:52.870,想告诉臣妾时自然会说,00:03:52.060,00:03:53.960,you will tell me if you want to.
00:03:53.960,00:03:54.830,你自己看看,00:03:54.760,00:03:56.060,Take a look at this.
00:03:56.480,00:03:58.230,允漌竟然这样大胆,00:03:57.500,00:03:59.140,Yun-e is so impudent!
00:04:05.000,00:04:07.460,他要皇上追封他的生母,00:04:05.980,00:04:08.980,"He asks Your Majesty to promote
his mother Consort Dowager Wenxi"
00:04:08.440,00:04:10.110,温僖贵妃为贵太妃,00:04:09.440,00:04:11.640,to the rank of Noble Consort Dowager
00:04:11.240,00:04:13.030,并迁葬入先帝妃陵,00:04:12.200,00:04:14.540,and move her tomb to the prior emperor's Consort Mausoleum.
00:04:14.280,00:04:17.670,温僖贵妃是先帝嫔妃,00:04:15.300,00:04:18.700,"It is reasonable to grant the prior emperor's
Consort Dowager Wenxi"
00:04:19.120,00:04:20.150,虽然早死,,,
00:04:20.960,00:04:22.710,追封亦在情理之中,00:04:20.140,00:04:23.660,a posthumous promotion although she died young.
00:04:23.520,00:04:25.820,只是温僖贵妃当年死得难堪,00:04:24.540,00:04:27.220,But she didn't have a dignified death.
00:04:27.240,00:04:29.750,先帝下旨不许葬入妃陵,00:04:28.320,00:04:30.960,"The prior emperor forbade her to be
buried in the Consort Mausoleum."
00:04:30.720,00:04:33.990,那皇上若真允了敦亲王所言,00:04:31.720,00:04:34.900,"If Your Majesty approves,"
00:04:35.240,00:04:37.990,那先帝的颜面要往何处放,00:04:36.220,00:04:39.060,it will violate the decree of the prior emperor.
00:04:39.160,00:04:40.470,皇上要如何自处,00:04:40.180,00:04:42.440,How will Your Majesty be able to be at peace?
00:04:42.080,00:04:45.750,他这分明是要置朕于不孝之地,00:04:43.000,00:04:46.800,He obviously wants to set me against my filial piety
00:04:46.560,00:04:48.550,就连先帝的颜面也不顾了,00:04:47.560,00:04:50.260,"and shows no regard to the prestige of
the prior emperor."
00:04:50.080,00:04:51.220,更可恶的是,00:04:51.000,00:04:52.440,"And coincidentally,"
00:04:52.040,00:04:53.710,允漌才上了这封奏章,00:04:53.000,00:04:54.940,"right after Yun-e submitted his memorandum,"
00:04:54.440,00:04:57.910,年羹尧就向朕提出要安抚后宫,00:04:55.520,00:04:58.940,"Nian Gengyao proposed that I should
appease the harem"
00:04:58.440,00:05:00.820,追封太妃 重修妃陵,00:04:59.420,00:05:02.220,"through granting posthumous titles
and restoring the Consort Mausoleum."
00:05:01.520,00:05:02.830,皇上的意思是,00:05:02.580,00:05:03.840,So Your Majesty suspects ...
00:05:03.640,00:05:06.790,敦亲王和年羹尧暗中勾结,00:05:04.680,00:05:08.020,that State Prince Dun is colluding with Nian Gengyao?
00:05:08.280,00:05:08.910,混账,,,
00:05:09.520,00:05:10.990,皇上 息怒,00:05:08.920,00:05:10.480,Rice-eating ingrates!
00:05:11.440,00:05:12.470,别为了他们生气,00:05:10.600,00:05:12.220,"Your Majesty, calm your anger."
00:05:12.840,00:05:14.470,若伤了自己的身子更不值了,00:05:12.440,00:05:13.780,"For the good of your health,"
,,,00:05:13.800,00:05:15.580,don't be mad because of them.
00:05:15.120,00:05:16.950,是可忍 孰不可忍,00:05:16.140,00:05:18.020,"If this is tolerated, what cannot be?"
00:05:18.320,00:05:21.710,就算朕肯做这个不肖之子,00:05:19.300,00:05:22.640,Even if I would be unfilial to my father
00:05:22.320,00:05:23.630,也能对他们的暗中勾结,,,
00:05:23.920,00:05:25.140,睁一只眼闭一只眼,00:05:23.260,00:05:25.960,"and turn a blind eye to their collusion,"
00:05:25.440,00:05:27.030,可是太后怎么肯,00:05:26.240,00:05:28.240,how would this make the Empress Dowager feel?
00:05:27.480,00:05:29.910,这贵太妃的追称也实在不妥,00:05:28.460,00:05:30.980,"Also, the title of Noble Consort Dowager
is not appropriate."
00:05:30.720,00:05:31.990,宫中亲王的生母,,,
00:05:32.320,00:05:33.830,都还未加封为贵太妃,00:05:31.680,00:05:34.820,"The other lords' mothers have not
been granted this title."
00:05:34.440,00:05:35.310,怎就轮到她一个,,,
00:05:35.600,00:05:36.740,被先帝厌弃的人了,00:05:35.360,00:05:37.920,How can a forsaken consort be the first to receive it?
00:05:37.920,00:05:39.510,若真允了敦亲王所言,,,
00:05:40.400,00:05:43.790,那诸王和后宫太妃心中必有嫌隙,00:05:38.860,00:05:44.640,"If Your Majesty approves, it will create rifts
among both the lords and their mothers."
00:05:45.120,00:05:48.110,那前朝与后宫都将要不安稳了,00:05:46.100,00:05:49.380,It will disturb the peace in both the court and the harem.
00:05:48.840,00:05:53.430,朕若允他 必失前朝后宫的人心,00:05:49.840,00:05:51.080,"If I approve,"
,,,00:05:52.320,00:05:54.460,I will lose support in both the court and the harem.
00:05:54.000,00:05:57.150,若是不允 他必定怀恨在心,00:05:54.940,00:05:56.080,"But if I don't,"
,,,00:05:56.580,00:05:58.320,they will certainly hold a grudge.
00:05:58.400,00:06:01.670,前番种种安抚皆算是白费,00:05:59.420,00:06:02.620,All of our effort to pacify them would have been futile.
00:06:02.600,00:06:04.470,皇上对年羹尧隐忍颇多,00:06:03.640,00:06:05.560,Your Majesty has long endured Nian Gengyao.
00:06:05.600,00:06:06.820,是否还要再忍,00:06:06.560,00:06:08.060,Will you tolerate him again this time?
00:06:07.480,00:06:08.540,年党众多,00:06:08.540,00:06:10.100,Nian Gengyao is allied with many.
00:06:10.120,00:06:11.790,朕若是不想再忍耐,00:06:11.160,00:06:12.900,"Even if I want to remove him,"
00:06:12.800,00:06:15.070,一时之间也只有四成胜算,00:06:13.760,00:06:16.300,my chance of success now is merely four out of ten.
00:06:16.560,00:06:20.260,年羹尧不满朕冷落年妃已久,00:06:17.620,00:06:21.460,"Nian Gengyao has been discontent
about me treating Consort Nian coldly."
00:06:21.360,00:06:24.230,他步步试探 靠拢敦亲王,00:06:22.320,00:06:25.200,"He has made moves to get closer to Prince Dun,"
00:06:24.840,00:06:26.390,不外是首鼠两端,,,
00:06:26.760,00:06:27.790,各有依靠罢了,00:06:25.900,00:06:29.000,"so he can rely on both the throne,
and its aspirants."
00:06:30.320,00:06:31.630,臣妾身处后宫,00:06:31.300,00:06:33.080,I'm a concubine in the harem
00:06:32.840,00:06:35.270,前朝之事若非事关皇上,,,
00:06:35.600,00:06:36.790,臣妾也不敢涉及,00:06:33.880,00:06:37.660,and I would not involve myself in any affairs in court.
00:06:38.440,00:06:40.740,臣妾只知道与皇上风花雪月,00:06:39.460,00:06:42.220,"I have only read the
""wind, snow, moon, and flowers"" with Your Majesty"
00:06:41.480,00:06:44.830,却不知皇上也有皇上的无奈,00:06:42.400,00:06:46.000,"and have never known that there are moments
when an emperor can feel powerless."
00:06:45.640,00:06:49.150,帝王将相 后妃嫔御,00:06:46.580,00:06:48.180,"An emperor or an official,"
00:06:50.160,00:06:50.990,又有哪一个,00:06:48.820,00:06:50.500,"a concubine or a maid,"
00:06:51.280,00:06:52.990,不是活在自己的无奈里,00:06:51.140,00:06:53.820,who can escape the feelings of powerlessness in life?
00:06:53.480,00:06:54.390,各有掣肘,,,
00:06:55.200,00:06:56.310,那为长远计,00:06:54.460,00:06:55.880,Everyone's arms are bound by rope.
,,,00:06:56.140,00:06:57.580,"So for the long term,"
00:06:57.200,00:06:59.870,皇上也只能忍耐了,00:06:58.240,00:07:00.860,Your Majesty has to endure.
00:07:00.440,00:07:03.980,朕这个皇上做得是太窝囊了,00:07:01.460,00:07:05.020,I sometimes feel more like a coward than an emperor.
00:07:05.960,00:07:08.420,汉景帝为平七国之乱,00:07:06.940,00:07:09.520,Emperor Jing of Han had to kill Chao Cuo
00:07:09.080,00:07:10.430,不得不杀了晃错,00:07:10.040,00:07:11.620,to quell the Revolt of the Seven Kingdoms.
00:07:11.000,00:07:13.110,光武帝刘秀为了复兴汉室,00:07:12.120,00:07:14.600,"Emperor Guangwu of Han had to
live with the murder of his brother"
00:07:13.560,00:07:15.270,连自己兄长被杀也要忍耐,00:07:14.600,00:07:16.460,in order to revive the Han Dynasty.
00:07:16.520,00:07:17.830,甚至为了稳定朝政,,,
00:07:18.200,00:07:18.710,都不能册封,00:07:17.520,00:07:18.880,"To establish stability in his reign,"
00:07:19.080,00:07:20.630,自己心爱的阴丽华为皇后,00:07:19.100,00:07:21.520,he had to promote Lady Guo to be his empress
00:07:20.960,00:07:22.020,只能封郭氏女,,,
00:07:22.680,00:07:23.550,但这之后,00:07:21.840,00:07:23.500,instead of his beloved Yin Lihua.
00:07:23.920,00:07:26.380,也是他们平定天下开创盛世,00:07:23.720,00:07:27.260,"But after restoring peace, prosperous times followed."
00:07:27.400,00:07:28.790,大丈夫能屈能伸,00:07:28.320,00:07:30.300,"""A man of strong character has the flexibility
to both advance or retreat.”"
00:07:29.280,00:07:30.500,皇上忍一时之痛,00:07:30.400,00:07:32.020,Your Majesty's tolerance of the temporary aching
00:07:30.920,00:07:33.480,才能为朝政谋万世之全,00:07:32.060,00:07:34.500,will lead to the country's thousand years of thriving.
00:07:34.040,00:07:36.600,并非窝囊只是屈己为政,00:07:35.020,00:07:37.700,"This is not cowardly, but governing through retreat."
00:07:41.320,00:07:42.110,嬛嬛,00:07:42.340,00:07:43.280,Huan Huan
00:07:43.360,00:07:47.270,你说的话总是能叫朕心里舒坦,00:07:44.380,00:07:48.040,Your words always bring my mind peace.
00:07:48.760,00:07:50.150,臣妾不是宽慰皇上,00:07:49.800,00:07:51.520,I didn't intend them as consolation.
00:07:50.960,00:07:52.020,是实话实说,00:07:52.020,00:07:53.380,I was simply speaking the truth.
00:07:53.280,00:07:53.990,不错,00:07:54.300,00:07:55.380,You're right.
00:07:55.400,00:07:56.830,朕的确要忍,00:07:56.500,00:07:58.060,I have to endure it.
00:07:57.680,00:08:00.470,可朕如何能忍下去呢,00:07:58.780,00:08:01.540,But what should I do to endure it?
00:08:01.440,00:08:04.470,那就请皇上依照敦亲王所言,00:08:02.340,00:08:05.740,Your Majesty will approve of State Prince Dun's request
00:08:05.760,00:08:08.320,追封温僖贵妃为贵太妃,00:08:06.900,00:08:09.580,"granting the title Noble Consort Dowager
to Consort Dowager Wenxi."
00:08:16.800,00:08:18.550,连莞嫔娘娘都劝不住了,00:08:17.780,00:08:19.600,Even Concubine Sourire cannot help ...
00:08:19.280,00:08:20.390,那怎么办呢 师傅,,,
00:08:20.800,00:08:21.910,我哪知道怎么办,00:08:19.860,00:08:21.340,"What should we do, shifu?"
00:08:22.240,00:08:23.550,莞嫔娘娘都没辙,00:08:21.740,00:08:22.920,How am I supposed to know?
,,,00:08:23.280,00:08:25.000,Even Concubine Sourire doesn't.
00:08:24.800,00:08:25.550,皇上,00:08:25.600,00:08:26.840,Your Majesty.
00:08:26.400,00:08:28.310,没事一会儿再来收拾,00:08:27.360,00:08:29.440,It's all right. Come clean up later.
00:08:32.600,00:08:33.580,那就请皇上,00:08:33.580,00:08:34.880,Your Majesty will
00:08:34.720,00:08:36.670,追封温僖贵妃为贵太妃,00:08:35.660,00:08:37.820,"grant the title Noble Consort Dowager
to Consort Dowager Wenxi."
00:08:37.960,00:08:38.870,加以封号,00:08:38.900,00:08:40.300,along with an honorary name
00:08:39.600,00:08:41.270,迁葬入先帝妃陵,00:08:40.560,00:08:42.580,and move her tomb into the Consort Mausoleum.
00:08:42.320,00:08:45.230,同时加封宫中各位太妃,00:08:43.280,00:08:46.200,"At the same time, promote all concubines
of the prior emperor"
00:08:45.800,00:08:46.710,加以尊号,00:08:46.760,00:08:48.320,and bestow honorary names.
00:08:49.240,00:08:52.030,尤其是寿祺太妃为诸太妃之首,00:08:50.080,00:08:53.420,"Especially Consort Dowager Shouxi,
who is the head of all consort dowagers."
00:08:53.880,00:08:56.180,更要为太后崇以尊号,00:08:54.800,00:08:57.520,"And crown Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
with the most eminent honorary name"
00:08:56.840,00:08:58.390,以显皇上孝义之情,00:08:57.540,00:09:00.120,"to show Your Majesty's filial piety to
Her Majesty and respect for your brothers."
00:08:59.000,00:09:01.830,不错 他要追封他的生母,00:09:00.120,00:09:02.880,You’re right. He wants to confer his mother.
00:09:02.680,00:09:06.710,朕就以为太后祝祷祈求安康之名,00:09:03.620,00:09:07.800,"Then I’m going to grant all the
consort dowagers honorific titles"
00:09:07.440,00:09:09.550,为诸位太妃都加以尊号,00:09:08.300,00:09:10.620,in the name of praying for peace for Her Majesty.
00:09:10.240,00:09:14.350,如此前朝后宫皆无异议,00:09:11.220,00:09:15.100,So nobody in the court nor harem can disagree.
00:09:15.000,00:09:17.630,这样不仅言官不会有所议论,00:09:16.020,00:09:18.540,"If so, the civil officials won’t be critical,"
00:09:18.560,00:09:21.510,宫中王爷太妃也会感沐皇上恩德,00:09:19.440,00:09:22.940,"and the lords and consort dowagers will also
appreciate Your Majesty’s grace."
00:09:22.960,00:09:24.630,只是果郡王的生母,,,
00:09:25.080,00:09:26.630,舒太妃已然出家,00:09:24.060,00:09:28.140,"But Nobel Prince Guo’s mother
Consort Dowager Serein has become a Taoist nun."
00:09:27.520,00:09:28.950,皇上要如何安置呢,,,
00:09:29.280,00:09:30.790,老十七不会在意这些,00:09:28.560,00:09:30.160,How should Your Majesty treat her case?
00:09:31.680,00:09:33.230,果郡王虽然不会在意,00:09:30.280,00:09:32.100,Yunli does not care about these kinds of things.
00:09:33.840,00:09:36.030,只怕有些小人会因此揣度,00:09:32.680,00:09:34.540,"Although Nobel Prince Guo doesn’t care,"
00:09:36.280,00:09:37.550,皇上轻视果郡王,00:09:34.880,00:09:38.880,"I’m afraid some schemers may distort this to
Your Majesty caring less about Nobel Prince Guo."
00:09:39.040,00:09:41.950,不如也请皇上有意于果郡王吧,00:09:40.040,00:09:43.040,"Your Majesty may as well
bestow the honor upon Nobel Prince Guo."
00:09:42.600,00:09:43.950,这又有什么难办呢,00:09:43.560,00:09:45.320,This won't be difficult.
00:09:44.680,00:09:46.310,舒太妃已经出家了,00:09:45.740,00:09:47.760,"Since Consort Dowager Serein is a Taoist nun,"
00:09:47.040,00:09:48.830,尊号是不宜再加了,00:09:47.980,00:09:50.160,an imperial title isn’t proper anymore.
00:09:49.600,00:09:54.950,朕就遥尊舒太妃为冲静元师吧,00:09:50.740,00:09:55.760,"Instead, I’ll regard her as Venerable Abbess Serene."
00:09:56.520,00:09:59.390,如此那便再无不妥了,00:09:57.640,00:10:00.720,Now the whole act has been properly arranged.
00:10:01.240,00:10:03.310,你不愧是朕的解语花,00:10:02.200,00:10:04.600,You deserve the title of My Illuminating Flower.
00:10:04.560,00:10:06.990,能事事为朕留心,00:10:05.580,00:10:08.100,You notice every detail for me.
00:10:08.040,00:10:09.670,皇上为天下事操劳,,,
00:10:10.080,00:10:11.300,臣妾不懂朝政,00:10:09.100,00:10:10.900,Your Majesty attends to everything under Heaven.
00:10:11.800,00:10:12.860,也只能在这些小事上,00:10:11.100,00:10:12.440,I know nothing about governance
00:10:13.160,00:10:14.630,为皇上留心了,00:10:12.800,00:10:15.560,"so I can only keep an eye on such
trivial matters for Your Majesty."
00:10:14.840,00:10:16.590,千里之行积于硅步,00:10:15.700,00:10:17.920,"""A thousand miles of travel is made of single steps."""
00:10:17.360,00:10:21.510,你为朕考虑的小事为知不是大事,00:10:18.340,00:10:22.380,"How could you know that your so-called ""trivial matters"" are not critical ones?"
00:10:28.480,00:10:29.540,皇后娘娘驾到,00:10:29.400,00:10:30.720,Your Majesty.
00:10:30.440,00:10:31.580,皇后娘娘万安,00:10:31.540,00:10:32.800,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:10:32.680,00:10:34.590,本宫听说皇上动大气了,00:10:33.700,00:10:35.700,I heard His Majesty was incensed.
00:10:35.120,00:10:36.310,所以过来瞧瞧,,,
00:10:36.520,00:10:37.110,是,00:10:36.100,00:10:37.260,So I’m here.
,,,00:10:37.560,00:10:38.380,Yes.
00:10:37.480,00:10:40.190,可是莞嫔娘娘已经在里头了,00:10:38.560,00:10:41.140,But Concubine Souire is already inside with His Majesty.
00:10:43.320,00:10:46.150,那有劳苏公公给皇上通传一声,00:10:44.360,00:10:48.380,Please let His Majesty know that I came.
00:10:46.520,00:10:47.630,本宫已经来过了,,,
00:10:48.120,00:10:48.710,嗻,00:10:48.920,00:10:49.820,Yes.
00:10:52.480,00:10:54.910,娘娘 皇上在气头上不见也好,00:10:53.440,00:10:56.100,"Your Majesty, we might as well wait
until His Majesty calms down."
00:10:55.280,00:10:56.670,既然莞嫔在了,00:10:56.320,00:10:57.960,"Now that Concubine Souire is with him,"
00:10:57.080,00:10:59.230,皇上自然不需要本宫了,00:10:58.100,00:10:59.980,His Majesty doesn't need me.
00:10:59.960,00:11:01.070,去太后那里吧,00:11:00.920,00:11:02.480,We will visit the Empress Dowager.
00:11:04.600,00:11:06.150,请皇上再广施恩德,00:11:05.580,00:11:07.540,I beg for Your Majesty to extend your favor
00:11:06.600,00:11:08.270,复年妃为华妃之位,00:11:07.660,00:11:09.620,and reinstate Consort Nian to Consort Fleur.
00:11:08.720,00:11:11.590,朕若复她之位 如何对得起你,00:11:09.740,00:11:12.600,"If I reinstate her, isn’t it unfair to you?"
00:11:12.160,00:11:14.350,又如何堵众人悠悠之口,00:11:13.140,00:11:15.380,And how would I quiet down any complaints?
00:11:14.960,00:11:16.310,年妃和年羹尧一样,00:11:15.920,00:11:17.600,Consort Nian and her brother are alike.
00:11:17.160,00:11:19.590,一旦得意放松才会有过失可寻,00:11:18.140,00:11:21.440,"Indulging their pride will slacken their vigilance,
and their mistakes will come to light."
00:11:20.440,00:11:21.710,何况只有她重定,,,
00:11:22.320,00:11:23.990,年氏一族才会真正放松,00:11:21.580,00:11:25.280,"Moreover, only her reinstatement will allow
the Nian family to truly relax."
00:11:29.840,00:11:32.030,皇上为国大事可以忍耐,00:11:30.820,00:11:33.520,"If Your Majesty can endure for the sake of the country,"
00:11:33.200,00:11:34.950,臣妾也可以为了皇上忍耐,00:11:34.120,00:11:36.000,so can I endure for Your Majesty.
00:11:45.440,00:11:48.390,这样是委屈你呀,00:11:46.460,00:11:47.540,It will
00:11:49.200,00:11:50.550,臣妾不会觉得委屈,00:11:48.220,00:11:49.820,be an injustice to you.
00:11:51.200,00:11:52.340,只要是为了皇上,00:11:50.200,00:11:51.700,I don't think it’s injustice.
,,,00:11:52.180,00:11:53.620,"For Your Majesty,"
00:11:52.960,00:11:55.630,臣妾会尽心忍让年妃的,00:11:53.940,00:11:56.640,I’ll do my utmost to tolerate Consort Nian.
00:11:58.720,00:11:59.430,好,00:11:59.720,00:12:00.800,All right.
00:12:00.960,00:12:03.990,嬛嬛 咱们的孩子没了,00:12:01.960,00:12:04.960,"Huan Huan, we lost our child."
00:12:05.200,00:12:06.260,是朕对不住你,00:12:06.260,00:12:07.500,I'm deeply sorry.
00:12:08.040,00:12:09.260,不过你放心,00:12:09.060,00:12:10.280,Trust me.
00:12:10.360,00:12:13.670,朕一定会还你一个公道,00:12:11.440,00:12:14.760,I will definitely bring you justice.
00:12:22.800,00:12:25.830,敦亲王要追封温僖贵妃,00:12:23.800,00:12:27.020,"State Prince Dun wants to confer a title on
Noble Consort Wenxi."
00:12:26.520,00:12:27.790,年羹尧也附议,00:12:27.540,00:12:29.140,Nian Gengyao seconded his motion.
00:12:28.360,00:12:31.550,一转眼 尘归尘 土归土,00:12:29.400,00:12:32.400,"In the blink of an eye, ""dust returns to dust""."
00:12:33.760,00:12:35.670,再如何追封尊荣,00:12:34.780,00:12:36.900,"No matter how high of a title she receives,"
00:12:36.560,00:12:39.350,人在九泉 还能如何得知呢,00:12:37.560,00:12:40.200,"how will she know from ""under the Yellow Springs""?"
00:12:40.720,00:12:43.790,皇额娘允准儿子追封,00:12:41.620,00:12:44.720,"Imperial Mother, do you allow me to confer on her?"
00:12:45.840,00:12:46.790,为何不允,00:12:46.840,00:12:48.360,Why wouldn’t I allow?
00:12:47.800,00:12:49.910,这功夫是做给活人看的,00:12:48.820,00:12:51.040,The effort is made for the living.
00:12:50.520,00:12:52.070,死人又如何得知,00:12:51.520,00:12:53.380,How can the dead know?
00:12:53.480,00:12:55.990,只要皇帝所做的事有利于朝政,00:12:54.440,00:12:57.220,"As long as your decision is good for the state,"
00:12:57.200,00:12:59.430,哀家不会在乎一己荣辱,00:12:58.220,00:13:00.500,I accept the impact to my honor.
00:13:01.400,00:13:02.430,多谢皇额娘,00:13:02.400,00:13:03.920,"Thank you, Imperial Mother."
00:13:04.360,00:13:06.070,时过境迁了,00:13:05.360,00:13:07.080,Time has passed and circumstances have changed.
00:13:06.800,00:13:08.270,哀家看着年妃,00:13:07.800,00:13:09.400,"Seeing Consort Nian,"
00:13:09.560,00:13:14.500,很怕年妃会像当年的温僖,00:13:10.700,00:13:15.500,I fear that she will become another Wenxi.
00:13:17.080,00:13:19.310,幸亏她没有子嗣,00:13:18.080,00:13:20.460,"Fortunately, she has no child."
00:13:21.560,00:13:23.630,儿子看重莞嫔也是如此,00:13:22.640,00:13:24.720,That’s also the reason why I value Concubine Sourire.
00:13:24.440,00:13:25.420,她失了孩子,00:13:25.320,00:13:26.700,She lost her child.
00:13:26.840,00:13:28.510,儿子总觉得亏欠了她,00:13:27.880,00:13:29.680,I’ve been feeling guilty about that.
00:13:30.080,00:13:31.750,哀家知道你怎么想,00:13:31.080,00:13:32.760,I know your worries.
00:13:33.360,00:13:36.030,咱们独独赐给年妃的欢宜香,,,
00:13:36.760,00:13:38.110,里头那味摩香,00:13:34.400,00:13:41.420,"The musk in Pleasancy, which we exclusively granted
Consort Nian, has already harmed her fertility."
00:13:38.560,00:13:40.430,早已伤了年妃的根本,,,
00:13:41.160,00:13:42.870,不过连累了莞嫔,,,
00:13:43.520,00:13:45.270,哀家和你都不想,00:13:42.180,00:13:46.100,"But, unexpectedly, Concubine Souire was affected."
00:13:46.400,00:13:49.110,事已至此 多想无益,00:13:47.360,00:13:50.120,"At this point, there is no good dwelling on it."
00:13:50.200,00:13:53.790,你若多宠爱莞嫔一些 也不打紧,00:13:51.140,00:13:54.720,It’s all right if you are partial towards her.
00:13:54.760,00:13:56.030,只是别太过,00:13:55.680,00:13:57.340,Just don’t be excessively so.
00:13:56.880,00:13:59.510,儿不是个好阿玛,00:13:57.840,00:14:00.500,I’m not a good father.
00:14:01.040,00:14:03.230,君王要有君王的决断,00:14:02.020,00:14:04.560,"An emperor makes the decisions
that an emperor has to make."
00:14:05.000,00:14:06.750,年妃一旦得子,00:14:06.040,00:14:07.800,"If Consort Nian had a son,"
00:14:07.920,00:14:09.230,到时候年羹尧,,,
00:14:09.920,00:14:12.220,一定会扶持这个孩子当皇帝,00:14:08.920,00:14:13.200,"Nian Gengyao would surely support
this child as the heir to the throne."
00:14:13.440,00:14:15.270,一旦有逼宫那一日,00:14:14.420,00:14:16.980,"Once they would force you to abdicate,"
00:14:16.320,00:14:17.630,哀家和你,,,
00:14:18.240,00:14:20.830,便连容身安命之所都没有了,00:14:17.360,00:14:21.660,you and I would not even have a place to reside.
00:14:23.280,00:14:29.510,不过皇帝眼下对年妃也太冷落了,00:14:24.240,00:14:30.480,"But recently, you've made her feel neglected."
00:14:30.880,00:14:32.830,敦亲王再难料理,00:14:31.880,00:14:34.020,"Even though State Prince Dun is difficult to deal with,"
00:14:33.160,00:14:35.670,也比不上年羹尧手握兵权,00:14:34.140,00:14:36.860,"Nian Gengyao is the knotty one
 wielding military power."
00:14:36.520,00:14:39.470,况且他二人已有勾结,00:14:37.560,00:14:40.560,"Moreover, there has already
been colluding between Nian and Dun."
00:14:40.760,00:14:41.590,所以,00:14:41.740,00:14:42.820,"Therefore,"
00:14:42.640,00:14:45.630,皇帝不得不对年妃多加以安抚,00:14:43.740,00:14:46.660,you need to make the effort to appease Consort Nian.
00:14:46.800,00:14:48.310,对年妃有安抚,00:14:47.860,00:14:49.640,"Not only to comfort her,"
00:14:50.360,00:14:51.190,也是不忍,00:14:51.260,00:14:53.000,but I also have sympathy for her.
00:14:52.600,00:14:54.550,毕竟她侍奉儿子多年,00:14:53.560,00:14:55.920,"After all, she has been with me
for all these years"
00:14:55.920,00:14:57.430,对待儿子是真心的,00:14:56.920,00:14:58.820,and treats me with a sincere heart.
00:14:59.720,00:15:02.910,儿子是人君 亦是人父,00:15:00.720,00:15:03.920,I’m an emperor and a father.
00:15:04.080,00:15:06.030,当年年妃有孕,00:15:05.040,00:15:07.320,"When Consort Nian was pregnant,"
00:15:07.320,00:15:09.390,儿子不得已杀了自己的孩子,00:15:08.300,00:15:10.560,I had no choice but to kill my own child.
00:15:10.640,00:15:11.750,为能不痛,00:15:11.560,00:15:13.080,How could it not bring pain?
00:15:12.360,00:15:15.630,当年的事既然借了端妃的手,00:15:13.400,00:15:16.500,It was done with Consort Honnête's hands.
00:15:16.480,00:15:18.550,端妃也接了这个黑锅,00:15:17.460,00:15:19.900,"Since she has taken all of the blame,"
00:15:19.240,00:15:20.710,就不要再去想了,00:15:20.220,00:15:21.940,you should let it go.
00:15:21.600,00:15:23.870,儿子的那么多孩子都保不住,00:15:22.580,00:15:24.920,I have lost so many children.
00:15:25.360,00:15:27.270,为知不是上天的报应呢,00:15:26.300,00:15:28.480,Who knows whether that is Heaven's punishment.
00:15:27.960,00:15:29.470,给年妃送去的药,00:15:28.860,00:15:30.900,I personally measured out the herbs
00:15:30.040,00:15:32.030,都是哀家亲手配制的,00:15:31.020,00:15:33.120,that were sent to Consort Nian.
00:15:32.840,00:15:35.710,若有报应 也不在皇上你,00:15:33.760,00:15:35.360,"If someone has to be punished,"
,,,00:15:35.360,00:15:36.920,it shouldn’t go to you.
00:15:40.400,00:15:42.830,以前皇上每每动气,00:15:41.300,00:15:43.880,"In the past, when His Majesty got angry,"
00:15:43.920,00:15:46.550,都是本宫待在他身边伺候的,00:15:44.680,00:15:47.320,I was the one always by his side.
00:15:46.800,00:15:48.110,莞嫔仅是一次而已,00:15:47.460,00:15:49.560,"Concubine Sourire is only aiding
His Majesty this one time."
00:15:48.920,00:15:50.310,这要是让太后知道了,00:15:49.840,00:15:51.480,"If the Empress Dowager knows,"
00:15:50.800,00:15:51.940,一定会劝皇上的,00:15:51.680,00:15:53.300,she will advise His Majesty.
00:15:53.600,00:15:54.430,娘娘,00:15:54.500,00:15:55.600,Your Majesty.
00:15:56.480,00:15:59.990,莞嫔现在进出养心殿,00:15:57.320,00:16:03.100,"Lately, Concubine Sourire has been a regular
visitor to the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:16:00.520,00:16:02.150,已经成平常事了,,,
00:16:02.760,00:16:04.070,后宫不许干政,,,
00:16:04.360,00:16:05.830,莞嫔她也应当避嫌呢,00:16:03.560,00:16:05.200,"Concubines are prohibited from
interfering in state affairs."
00:16:06.200,00:16:07.510,干政又如何,00:16:05.200,00:16:07.040,Concubine Sourire should avoid raising suspicions.
00:16:08.000,00:16:09.510,是皇上允许的,00:16:07.240,00:16:08.680,It is not interference
00:16:10.040,00:16:11.350,奴婢觉得可不一定,00:16:09.040,00:16:10.580,as long as His Majesty permits it.
,,,00:16:10.900,00:16:12.600,"Not necessarily, Your Majesty."
00:16:11.760,00:16:13.750,这还要看皇上的兴致如何呢,00:16:12.640,00:16:14.700,That is still up to His Majesty's mood.
00:16:15.240,00:16:16.070,也是,00:16:16.080,00:16:17.080,I agree.
00:16:16.880,00:16:19.830,皇上高兴了 就多跟她说几句,00:16:17.720,00:16:21.100,"If it pleases His Majesty, he can
discuss matters with her."
00:16:20.400,00:16:22.860,不高兴了 她就是干政了,00:16:21.320,00:16:24.040,"If not, she will be considered
as violating the prohibition."
00:16:25.640,00:16:26.910,启禀皇后娘娘,00:16:26.600,00:16:27.920,"Your Majesty,"
00:16:27.240,00:16:29.870,皇上这个时候往翊坤宫去了,00:16:28.220,00:16:30.860,His Majesty is heading to the Palace of Earthly Honor.
00:16:30.440,00:16:34.550,本宫知道 迟早会有这一天,00:16:31.280,00:16:33.220,I knew this would happen ...
,,,00:16:33.440,00:16:35.660,sooner or later.
00:16:39.000,00:16:39.790,娘娘,00:16:39.760,00:16:40.560,Your Highness!
00:16:40.560,00:16:41.350,娘娘,00:16:41.280,00:16:42.080,Your Highness!
00:16:42.360,00:16:43.070,娘娘,00:16:43.200,00:16:43.920,Your Highness!
00:16:44.480,00:16:46.830,娘娘 皇上已经到翊坤宫外了,00:16:45.380,00:16:47.900,"Your Highness, His Majesty is outside our palace!"
00:16:47.120,00:16:48.180,娘娘快接驾吧,00:16:47.980,00:16:49.440,Your Highness must get ready.
00:17:02.480,00:17:03.190,起来吧,00:17:03.380,00:17:04.320,Rise.
00:17:04.320,00:17:05.460,谢皇上,00:17:05.060,00:17:06.400,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:28.560,00:17:30.350,朕来了 你不高兴,00:17:29.460,00:17:31.680,Are you not happy to see me?
00:17:32.200,00:17:33.260,臣妾高兴,00:17:33.060,00:17:34.440,"I am, Your Majesty."
00:17:35.480,00:17:37.230,朕许久没有来看你了,00:17:36.320,00:17:38.600,I have not visited for some time.
00:17:38.320,00:17:39.430,臣妾还以为,00:17:39.240,00:17:40.480,I thought
00:17:40.840,00:17:42.430,皇上再也不会来了,00:17:41.780,00:17:43.700,that Your Majesty would never come to see me.
00:17:43.040,00:17:44.310,朕是生你的气,00:17:43.900,00:17:45.480,"I was angry with you,"
00:17:46.240,00:17:48.390,忍着不愿意来见你,00:17:47.080,00:17:49.360,"and, I kept myself away from you."
00:17:52.400,00:17:53.270,可是明日,00:17:53.160,00:17:54.400,But tomorrow ...
00:17:57.080,00:17:58.270,朕记得明日,00:17:58.000,00:17:59.200,I remember ...
00:17:59.120,00:18:00.950,是你当年入王府的日子,00:17:59.980,00:18:02.380,is the day that you were married into the family.
00:18:06.600,00:18:07.390,皇上,00:18:07.480,00:18:08.640,Your Majesty.
00:18:15.760,00:18:18.790,浣碧你听 外头的雪化了,00:18:16.640,00:18:17.820,"Jade, listen."
,,,00:18:18.560,00:18:19.960,The snow is melting.
00:18:21.760,00:18:24.030,果真呢 小主的耳力真好,00:18:22.640,00:18:25.160,"It is, My Lady. You have good hearing."
00:18:26.200,00:18:27.310,春天到了,00:18:27.080,00:18:28.600,Spring has come.
00:18:28.120,00:18:29.950,自然什么霜雪都能化解,00:18:28.920,00:18:31.040,All the snow and frost will melt.
00:18:31.760,00:18:35.110,皇上去翊坤宫 小主你不生气吗,00:18:32.700,00:18:36.360,"My Lady, aren't you troubled that His Majesty
went to the Palace of Earthly Honor?"
00:18:36.240,00:18:37.430,我今日才知道,00:18:37.020,00:18:38.960,"Until today, I had not known"
00:18:38.640,00:18:39.470,原来当皇上,,,
00:18:39.800,00:18:41.350,也有这么多为难和不得已,00:18:39.480,00:18:42.540,that even an emperor must compromise on many things.
00:18:42.880,00:18:44.750,既然我与皇上都有为难,00:18:43.760,00:18:46.220,"Since we both have our own concessions to make,"
00:18:45.640,00:18:47.110,又何必要彼此为难呢,00:18:46.380,00:18:48.300,we should be more understanding of each other.
00:18:47.760,00:18:49.590,只是皇上一去年妃那里,00:18:48.580,00:18:51.060,"But now that His Majesty is visiting Consort Nian,"
00:18:50.560,00:18:52.860,怕年妃又会成为小主的大敌呢,00:18:51.340,00:18:54.420,"she may rise again as a strong enemy, My Lady."
00:18:55.120,00:18:56.750,若是有我一人之敌,,,
00:18:57.440,00:18:58.630,我自然没有办法,00:18:55.760,00:18:59.940,"If I confronted an enemy on my own,
I would be helpless;"
00:19:00.680,00:19:02.510,可是我若与皇上一条心,00:19:01.540,00:19:03.900,"but if His Majesty and I share one heart,"
00:19:03.880,00:19:06.870,那么我的敌人也会是皇上的敌人,00:19:04.760,00:19:06.260,then my enemies
,,,00:19:06.420,00:19:08.360,will also be the enemies of His Majesty.
00:19:14.280,00:19:15.590,皇后娘娘请用茶,00:19:15.120,00:19:17.080,"Your Majesty, please have this tea."

00:19:25.280,00:19:26.870,昨天都睡得好吗,00:19:26.160,00:19:27.860,Did you sleep well last night?
00:19:27.160,00:19:27.750,还好,00:19:27.960,00:19:28.960,Quite well.
00:19:28.360,00:19:31.310,本宫昨夜听到雪化的声音,00:19:29.180,00:19:32.340,I heard the snow melting last night.
00:19:31.920,00:19:33.670,滴答答响了一夜,00:19:32.800,00:19:34.820,It was dripping the whole night.
00:19:34.440,00:19:35.470,娘娘没睡好吗,,,
00:19:36.120,00:19:37.030,本宫只怕,00:19:35.300,00:19:36.960,Your Majesty did not sleep well?
00:19:37.320,00:19:41.020,后宫的人昨夜都没睡好吧,00:19:36.960,00:19:41.980,"I am only worried that the entire harem
may not have slept well last night."
00:19:41.280,00:19:43.470,年妃娘娘到,00:19:42.040,00:19:44.840,Her Highness Consort Nian.

00:19:59.120,00:20:01.910,莞嫔 好久不见了,00:19:59.980,00:20:01.500,"Concubine Sourire,"
00:20:03.040,00:20:04.350,臣妾也是这样觉得,00:20:01.860,00:20:03.560,I haven't seen you for a long time.
,,,00:20:03.880,00:20:05.760,"I feel the same, Your Highness"
00:20:05.480,00:20:08.070,不过本宫倒是无时无刻不想到你,00:20:06.320,00:20:08.980,But I was always thinking about you.
00:20:08.560,00:20:09.830,虽然许久不见,00:20:09.180,00:20:11.320,"So, even though I haven't seen you for some time,"
00:20:10.360,00:20:11.950,却像是日日都见,00:20:11.320,00:20:13.240,it was as if I saw you every day.
00:20:14.600,00:20:16.070,昨日臣妾去见皇上,00:20:15.440,00:20:17.280,"When I went to see His Majesty yesterday,"
00:20:16.840,00:20:18.590,皇上也是这样想念娘娘的,,,
00:20:18.880,00:20:20.870,你倒是皇上肚子里的蛔虫,00:20:17.760,00:20:19.840,Your Majesty was on his mind in the same way.
00:20:21.160,00:20:22.110,什么都知道,00:20:19.840,00:20:23.280,"Do you know everything?
Are you a ringworm in His Majesty's stomach?"
00:20:22.520,00:20:23.470,臣妾不敢,,,
00:20:23.920,00:20:25.270,不过皇上想念娘娘,00:20:23.360,00:20:24.660,I dare not presume so.
00:20:25.680,00:20:26.870,宫中人尽皆知,00:20:24.800,00:20:26.440,Everyone in the harem can see
,,,00:20:26.440,00:20:28.180,how much His Majesty misses Your Highness.
00:20:28.120,00:20:29.470,倒承你吉言了,00:20:28.960,00:20:30.520,I will accept your kind words.
00:20:30.040,00:20:33.510,年妃 皇上一早让人选了些贡品,00:20:30.880,00:20:32.000,"Consort Nian,"
00:20:33.840,00:20:34.950,送到你宫里去了,00:20:32.000,00:20:35.900,"His Majesty selected some tributes and
had them sent to your palace this morning."
00:20:35.280,00:20:36.190,你可还喜欢吗,00:20:35.900,00:20:37.300,Do you like them?
00:20:36.520,00:20:39.350,只要是皇上选的 臣妾都喜欢,00:20:37.500,00:20:40.280,I like everthing His Majesty chooses for me.
00:20:39.760,00:20:40.790,喜欢就好,00:20:40.540,00:20:41.900,That's good.
00:20:41.920,00:20:44.990,这许久不见你出来都觉得疏远了,00:20:42.820,00:20:46.120,"I haven't seen you for so long
that you seem distant from me."
00:20:45.520,00:20:48.710,以后要常来本宫宫里面坐坐才好,00:20:46.380,00:20:49.580,You must come to my palace more often.
00:20:49.000,00:20:49.910,那是自然的,00:20:49.820,00:20:51.080,"I will,"
00:20:50.520,00:20:52.150,只要皇后娘娘不嫌烦,00:20:51.360,00:20:53.560,as long as Your Majesty is not bothered.
00:21:00.080,00:21:02.110,皇上驾到,00:21:01.000,00:21:03.240,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:21:04.000,00:21:04.710,皇上,00:21:04.700,00:21:05.640,Your Majesty.
00:21:12.400,00:21:14.230,皇上日日到臣妾这儿来,00:21:13.420,00:21:15.460,Your Majesty comes to my palace every day.
00:21:15.040,00:21:16.830,不嫌臣妾这儿的菜腻味吗,00:21:15.980,00:21:17.740,Are you not tired of the meals here?
00:21:17.120,00:21:18.310,从前你从不这样问,00:21:17.740,00:21:19.440,You have never asked me such questions before.
00:21:22.440,00:21:23.910,臣妾害怕,00:21:23.360,00:21:24.940,I'm just worried...
00:21:24.560,00:21:26.910,那朕走了 你便不问了,00:21:25.440,00:21:27.900,"Well, if I leave, you can stop worrying."
00:21:27.680,00:21:28.350,皇上,00:21:28.640,00:21:29.540,Your Majesty!
00:21:28.760,00:21:30.390,越发会胡思乱想了,00:21:29.560,00:21:31.360,You are having such foolish notions.
00:21:32.400,00:21:33.270,跟朕说说,00:21:33.340,00:21:34.280,"Tell me,"
00:21:33.560,00:21:35.150,都准备了些什么好吃的,00:21:34.280,00:21:36.120,what delicacies have you prepared?
00:21:36.600,00:21:38.030,皇上看了就知道了,00:21:37.640,00:21:39.600,Your Majesty will know when you see them.
00:21:50.080,00:21:53.310,臣甄远道参见皇上,00:21:50.860,00:21:54.520,Zhen Yuandao bows in respect before Your Majesty.
00:21:53.960,00:21:55.270,甄远道 请起,00:21:54.800,00:21:56.400,"Zhen Yuandao, please rise."
00:21:56.120,00:21:57.430,谢皇上,00:21:56.960,00:21:58.520,I thank Your Majesty.
00:21:59.880,00:22:01.710,在外你是朕的臣子,00:22:00.740,00:22:02.780,"In the court, you are my official."
00:22:02.160,00:22:03.710,在内你是朕的岳父,00:22:03.060,00:22:05.000,"In the family, you are my father-in-law."
00:22:04.440,00:22:05.500,就不要拘礼了,00:22:05.200,00:22:06.920,"So, don't be bound by formalities."
00:22:06.600,00:22:08.390,苏培盛 赐座,00:22:07.280,00:22:09.500,"Su Peisheng, take Mr. Zhen to the seat."
00:22:08.760,00:22:09.740,甄大人 请坐,00:22:09.680,00:22:11.300,"Mr. Zhen, please take a seat."
00:22:11.520,00:22:12.390,多谢公公,00:22:12.300,00:22:13.780,"Thank you, Mr. Su."
00:22:18.480,00:22:20.830,不知皇上急着召见微臣,,,
00:22:21.320,00:22:22.350,有何要事,00:22:19.320,00:22:23.560,"Your Majesty summoned me so urgently.
I await your important tidings."
00:22:22.760,00:22:25.320,朕升你做左副都御史,00:22:23.620,00:22:26.220,You were promoted to Left-Deputy Imperial Censor
00:22:25.600,00:22:26.430,你做得还惯吗,00:22:26.220,00:22:27.940,Are you accustomed to your new post?
00:22:27.560,00:22:31.430,皇恩浩荡 臣感谢皇上眷顾,00:22:28.380,00:22:32.420,"I thank Your Majesty for bestowing
Heaven's grace upon me."
00:22:31.880,00:22:35.150,你坐 动辄站起来朕也觉得生分,00:22:32.700,00:22:33.900,Please sit.
,,,00:22:33.900,00:22:36.480,A family needn't stand and bow to each other.
00:22:36.640,00:22:39.350,朕和莞嫔之间便没有这么多约束,00:22:37.500,00:22:40.840,"Concubine Sourire and I are not restrained by
such etiquette when we're together."
00:22:43.880,00:22:46.870,莞嫔娘娘自幼任性随意,00:22:44.640,00:22:48.960,"Concubine Sourire's temperament
has been indulged since she was very young."
00:22:47.160,00:22:48.190,不拘小节,,,
00:22:48.480,00:22:51.190,还请皇上不要怪罪她,00:22:49.420,00:22:52.040,"I hope Your Majesty will pardon her
if she has been careless."
00:22:52.040,00:22:53.430,朕喜欢她的性子,,,
00:22:53.880,00:22:55.190,得蒙皇上眷顾,00:22:52.940,00:22:54.580,I like her personality.
00:22:55.480,00:22:57.070,这是微臣一家,,,
00:22:57.680,00:22:59.750,和莞嫔娘娘的福气呀,00:22:54.580,00:23:00.800,"Your Majesty's appreciation is the highest honor
to Her Highness and my family."
00:23:00.080,00:23:01.550,朕召你来是想问你,00:23:01.020,00:23:03.480,I called you here to ask ...
00:23:01.800,00:23:05.710,让你朕络都察院可用之人的事,00:23:03.840,00:23:08.160,Have you identified trusted candidates for the Censorate?
00:23:06.160,00:23:07.070,办得怎么样了,,,
00:23:08.080,00:23:08.950,回皇上,00:23:08.820,00:23:10.080,"Your Majesty,"
00:23:10.200,00:23:12.950,皇上交付臣的事都已办妥,00:23:11.040,00:23:14.020,the task has been completed.
00:23:13.920,00:23:14.870,都察院中,00:23:14.740,00:23:16.580,"In the Censorate,"
00:23:15.080,00:23:18.110,右副都御史瓜尔佳鄂敏大人,00:23:16.580,00:23:19.260,"Right-Deputy Censor Gūwalgiya Emin,"
00:23:18.600,00:23:20.510,御史薛从俭大人,00:23:19.500,00:23:21.600,"Mr. Xue Congjian,"
00:23:20.760,00:23:23.320,洛平大人与臣都在暗中,00:23:21.660,00:23:23.500,and Mr. Luo Ping
00:23:23.640,00:23:26.830,搜集了不少年羹尧大不敬的罪状,00:23:23.500,00:23:27.840,"collaborated with me in secret to gather
evidence of Nian Gengyao's crimes."
00:23:27.120,00:23:29.070,只是没有皇上谕旨,00:23:27.920,00:23:30.140,"But, without Your Majesty's command,"
00:23:29.400,00:23:31.270,微臣不敢轻举妄动,00:23:30.140,00:23:32.380,we dared not take any actions.
00:23:35.000,00:23:36.950,年羹尧自回京以来,00:23:35.920,00:23:38.080,"Since he came back to Beijing,"
00:23:37.840,00:23:39.710,弹勤他的奏章一直不断,00:23:38.740,00:23:40.980,memorandums to reprimand him have arrived constantly.
00:23:40.440,00:23:41.550,朕都没有理会,00:23:41.500,00:23:43.020,I did nothing about them
00:23:42.600,00:23:44.980,只因还未找到万全之策,00:23:43.420,00:23:46.040,because I have not formed a proper plan
00:23:45.280,00:23:46.420,不能一举攻破,00:23:46.040,00:23:47.660,to strike him down with one maneuver.
00:23:46.960,00:23:49.830,皇上所言之事臣都明白,00:23:47.860,00:23:50.900,I fully understand Your Majesty.
00:23:50.320,00:23:54.020,臣定为皇上分忧 效犬马之劳,00:23:51.240,00:23:55.340,I will render my utmost service to allay Your Majesty's concerns.
00:23:54.840,00:23:55.630,那就好,00:23:55.740,00:23:56.980,I am pleased.
00:23:56.240,00:23:59.940,机会到了 朕会让张廷玉告诉你,00:23:57.180,00:24:00.960,Zhang Tingyu will inform you when the time comes.
00:24:00.280,00:24:02.310,臣自当尽心竭力,00:24:01.160,00:24:03.320,I will spare no effort.
00:24:03.080,00:24:03.830,对了,00:24:03.880,00:24:05.200,"One more thing,"
00:24:04.560,00:24:07.310,莞嫔在宫里 你难得进宫一趟,,,
00:24:07.600,00:24:08.630,要不要去看看她,00:24:05.420,00:24:09.780,"since you are in the palace,
would you like to visit Concubine Sourire?"
00:24:09.120,00:24:10.870,臣谢圣上隆恩,00:24:09.980,00:24:12.480,I thank Your Majesty for granting me the opportunity.
00:24:13.440,00:24:15.150,莞嫔娘娘小产以后,00:24:14.460,00:24:16.200,"Since Her Highness's miscarriage,"
00:24:15.720,00:24:18.710,臣与夫人十分挂心,00:24:16.600,00:24:19.820,my wife and I have worried about her very much.
00:24:19.520,00:24:22.910,只是这后宫禁地不宜擅入,00:24:20.380,00:24:23.920,"However, it is inappropriate for an official to enter the harem."
00:24:23.560,00:24:24.780,还是等臣夫人,,,
00:24:25.120,00:24:27.150,何时得蒙皇上恩诏时,00:24:24.360,00:24:28.300,"When my wife is granted the honor
to attend to Concubine Sourire,"
00:24:27.840,00:24:30.830,再来一同勤见莞嫔娘娘吧,00:24:28.600,00:24:31.900,we will pay respects to Her Highness together.
00:24:31.280,00:24:34.190,放心 朕会好好护着莞嫔,00:24:32.100,00:24:35.320,"Don't worry, I will take good care of Concubine Sourire."
00:24:34.560,00:24:37.230,臣与莞嫔娘娘能得蒙圣眷,00:24:35.600,00:24:37.980,"Concubine Sourire and I,"
00:24:37.520,00:24:38.580,感恩不尽,00:24:38.440,00:24:40.600,we are eternally grateful to Your Majesty.
00:24:40.000,00:24:41.060,时候不早了,00:24:40.820,00:24:42.240,It's getting late.
00:24:41.680,00:24:43.590,朕就不留你用晚膳了,00:24:42.500,00:24:44.640,I will not keep you for dinner.
00:24:44.120,00:24:46.500,苏培盛 好好送出去,00:24:45.000,00:24:46.200,Su Peisheng.
00:24:47.160,00:24:47.750,嗻,00:24:46.500,00:24:47.900,"Please, see Mr. Zhen out."
,,,00:24:48.040,00:24:49.160,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:24:49.400,00:24:50.830,微臣告退,00:24:50.260,00:24:52.000,Allow me to take my leave.
00:24:59.120,00:24:59.870,娘娘,,,
00:25:00.440,00:25:01.190,什么事,00:24:59.980,00:25:01.120,Your Highness.
00:25:02.240,00:25:03.870,娘娘和皇上重得和睦,00:25:01.320,00:25:02.280,What?
00:25:04.160,00:25:05.350,宫里宫外都高兴,00:25:03.200,00:25:06.360,"We servants and the officials are all happy that
Your Highness restored peace with His Majesty."
00:25:05.640,00:25:06.390,按照老规矩,00:25:06.400,00:25:07.440,"As before,"
00:25:06.640,00:25:08.510,外头想求着娘娘的人还多着呢,00:25:07.440,00:25:09.420,there are still many officials out there
00:25:08.800,00:25:09.710,还想孝敬娘娘,00:25:09.420,00:25:11.000,who desire Your Highness's favor.
00:25:10.960,00:25:12.150,今时不同往昔,00:25:11.860,00:25:13.280,It's different now.
00:25:13.160,00:25:15.230,本宫重得圣心极其不容易,00:25:14.040,00:25:16.260,It was not easy to regain His Majesty's favor.
00:25:15.800,00:25:17.150,切不能再轻举妄动,00:25:16.520,00:25:18.160,I must act with more caution.
00:25:17.600,00:25:19.710,可皇上待娘娘一如往昔啊,00:25:18.500,00:25:21.000,But His Majesty treats Your Highness the same way as before.
00:25:20.600,00:25:22.350,本宫也说不上哪里不对,00:25:21.540,00:25:23.360,"I cannot explain it,"
00:25:22.800,00:25:24.110,但总觉得皇上对本宫,,,
00:25:24.440,00:25:25.310,跟以前不一样了,00:25:23.660,00:25:26.340,but I can feel that His Majesty treats me differently now.
00:25:26.280,00:25:27.950,虽说皇上近日常来,00:25:27.220,00:25:29.440,"Although His Majesty has been visiting me frequently,"
00:25:28.800,00:25:30.470,可还没复本宫的位分,,,
00:25:31.120,00:25:32.950,也没有重新颁赏封号,00:25:29.660,00:25:33.740,I have not had my title reinstated.
00:25:34.040,00:25:36.070,本宫总觉得心里不踏实,00:25:34.880,00:25:37.000,I cannot put my mind at ease.
00:25:36.680,00:25:37.790,只要皇上常来,,,
00:25:38.080,00:25:39.470,这些还不是迟早的事,00:25:37.500,00:25:40.660,"As long as His Majesty visits frequently, the reinstatement is just a matter of time."
00:25:39.760,00:25:42.190,听说今天皇上又赏赐大将军了,00:25:40.660,00:25:43.660,"I heard that the Great General was
again rewarded by His Majesty today."
00:25:43.800,00:25:44.710,那就好,00:25:44.620,00:25:45.640,That's good.
00:25:45.600,00:25:47.230,本宫虽说有些脾气,00:25:46.460,00:25:48.240,"I know my temper is short,"
00:25:47.520,00:25:48.630,但比哥哥好多了,,,
00:25:49.360,00:25:50.420,本宫最怕的就是,00:25:48.240,00:25:49.820,but much better than his.
00:25:50.760,00:25:52.390,哥哥一时疏忽 得意忘形,00:25:50.180,00:25:54.420,"My biggest worry is that my brother may offend
His Majesty with his boastful manner."
00:25:52.680,00:25:53.550,见罪于皇上,,,
00:25:54.520,00:25:56.670,如今哥哥得到了皇上信任,00:25:55.380,00:25:57.560,"Since he has obtained His Majesty's trust,"
00:25:56.920,00:25:59.590,本宫稳坐后宫也就安心了,00:25:57.780,00:26:00.460,I can reside in the harem with ease.
00:26:02.080,00:26:03.630,去看看药膳炖好了吗,00:26:02.900,00:26:05.320,"Go and see if the nourishing stew is ready,"
00:26:04.480,00:26:06.710,等一下给皇上送去,00:26:05.320,00:26:07.640,"and if it is, send it to His Majesty."
00:26:07.320,00:26:07.910,是,00:26:08.200,00:26:09.060,Yes.
00:26:14.400,00:26:17.750,你这孩子手上有点功夫,00:26:14.960,00:26:18.580,Your hands are very skilled.
00:26:18.680,00:26:21.430,臣妾在家时也是这样伺候母亲的,00:26:19.500,00:26:22.440,"Back at home, I did this for my mother."
00:26:22.240,00:26:23.670,你倒是孝顺,00:26:23.060,00:26:24.820,You are a filial daughter.
00:26:25.600,00:26:27.310,身体发肤受之父母,00:26:26.380,00:26:28.440,"""My body, hair and skin are endowed by my parents."""
00:26:27.560,00:26:28.910,臣妾不敢不孝,00:26:28.460,00:26:30.080,This is my filial obligation.
00:26:29.800,00:26:31.150,哀家很想问你,00:26:30.820,00:26:32.680,I would like to know the reason
00:26:32.360,00:26:34.710,你为什么这么孝敬哀家,00:26:33.220,00:26:35.580,that you devote so much time to me.
00:26:35.400,00:26:37.150,太后是皇上的额娘,00:26:36.200,00:26:38.120,"Your Majesty is His Majesty's mother,"
00:26:37.400,00:26:38.750,又是臣妾的皇额娘,00:26:38.140,00:26:39.760,"my Imperial Mother,"
00:26:39.360,00:26:40.580,臣妾的主子,00:26:40.200,00:26:41.920,and a master of the palace.
00:26:41.040,00:26:43.630,臣妾敬服太后理当尽孝,00:26:41.940,00:26:44.660,It is my duty to serve Your Majesty.
00:26:47.040,00:26:48.870,你对哀家虽有孝心,00:26:47.920,00:26:50.480,"I recognize your filial devotion to me,"
00:26:49.960,00:26:53.030,可这心也该放点在皇帝身上,00:26:50.840,00:26:54.160,but you also need to devote more thoughts to His Majesty.
00:26:54.240,00:26:57.470,年纪轻轻的 成天跟哀家在一起,00:26:55.160,00:26:58.660,"You are so young, but you spend your time here all day."
00:26:58.280,00:27:00.470,你也要为自己打算打算,00:26:58.980,00:27:01.280,You have to plan for yourself.
00:27:02.160,00:27:05.390,太后这样说倒像是臣妾故意了,00:27:02.920,00:27:06.420,Your Majesty seems doubtful about my intention.
00:27:06.280,00:27:08.870,并非臣妾不愿亲近皇上,00:27:07.080,00:27:09.940,It's not that I wouldn't visit His Majesty.
00:27:09.560,00:27:10.470,只是,00:27:10.420,00:27:11.580,"However,"
00:27:11.040,00:27:13.830,一来太后的安康是皇上的心愿,00:27:11.920,00:27:14.860,Your Majesty's good health is His Majesty's wish.
00:27:14.160,00:27:16.350,臣妾理应孝敬太后才是,00:27:15.020,00:27:17.400,So it's required of me to serve Your Majesty.
00:27:17.240,00:27:20.550,二者众位妹妹伺候的皇上都很好,00:27:18.140,00:27:21.800,"Moreover, His Majesty is pleased with
the service of other concubines."
00:27:21.360,00:27:23.630,臣妾本就不擅长打扮,00:27:22.420,00:27:24.680,I am unaccustomed to wearing fine adornments.
00:27:23.960,00:27:25.910,哪里比得上太后的眼力呢,00:27:24.860,00:27:26.820,I know Your Majesty has a keen eye.
00:27:26.640,00:27:28.430,只盼着太后哪日得空,,,
00:27:28.680,00:27:30.270,指点了臣妾便罢了,00:27:27.440,00:27:31.320,"Perhaps one day, Your Majesty can
provide me with some advice."
00:27:31.320,00:27:34.230,如今臣妾在太后这里受益良多,00:27:32.160,00:27:35.300,I benefit so much from spending time with Your Majesty.
00:27:34.720,00:27:36.550,便是赶着也不肯走了,00:27:35.620,00:27:38.060,I hope Your Majesty will not turn me away.
00:27:38.160,00:27:41.070,你这孩子越来越能说会道了,00:27:39.100,00:27:42.020,You have a way with words.
00:27:42.160,00:27:43.870,有你在哀家身边,00:27:43.160,00:27:45.260,With your companionship
00:27:44.360,00:27:46.070,又有温太医的医术,00:27:45.260,00:27:47.400,"and Dr. Wen's attendance,"
00:27:46.560,00:27:48.940,哀家的身子怎么能不好呢,00:27:47.520,00:27:49.780,I will recover my health.
00:27:49.360,00:27:51.230,这都是温太医的功劳,00:27:50.220,00:27:52.320,The credit goes to Dr. Wen.
00:27:51.560,00:27:53.830,臣妾不过是趋奉左右而已,00:27:52.520,00:27:54.800,All I have done is follow Your Majesty's commands.
00:27:54.120,00:27:55.590,实在没什么用处的,00:27:54.840,00:27:56.700,I am not very useful.
00:27:57.080,00:27:59.110,臣妾知道娘娘从不用香,00:27:57.960,00:28:00.320,"I know Your Majesty never uses incense,"
00:27:59.480,00:28:01.070,但不知娘娘为何不用香,00:28:00.400,00:28:02.240,but I wonder why not.
00:28:02.600,00:28:04.710,是女人哪有不爱香的,00:28:03.440,00:28:05.560,Every woman likes sweet scents.
00:28:05.360,00:28:07.430,本宫是想按皇上的旨意,00:28:06.240,00:28:08.900,I refrain from using it
00:28:08.080,00:28:10.310,能够节省些香料银子,00:28:09.000,00:28:11.360,to reduce spending by His Majesty's decree.
00:28:10.680,00:28:11.990,只是再怎么节省,00:28:11.580,00:28:13.040,"However,"
00:28:12.240,00:28:14.390,旁人一看到年妃所用的欢宜香,,,
00:28:14.720,00:28:15.550,如此贵重,00:28:13.040,00:28:16.620,"if I don't allow others in the palace to use incense,"
00:28:15.920,00:28:17.110,就会有所怨言,,,
00:28:17.440,00:28:18.500,怪本宫苛刻,00:28:16.620,00:28:19.500,"they would complain when they see
Consort Nian using Pleasancy."
00:28:18.760,00:28:21.110,所以只好本宫一人不用罢了,00:28:19.640,00:28:22.040,"Therefore, I would rather forbid only myself from using incense."
00:28:21.360,00:28:22.190,娘娘慈心,00:28:22.140,00:28:23.400,Your Majesty is kind and considerate.
00:28:22.520,00:28:24.550,皇上必能体会娘娘一番苦心,00:28:23.400,00:28:25.520,His Majesty will appreciate your thought.
00:28:25.320,00:28:26.950,杯水车薪罢了,00:28:26.180,00:28:28.120,"It's throwing ""a cup of water on a burning carriage""."
00:28:29.560,00:28:30.670,皇后娘娘吉祥,,,
00:28:31.160,00:28:32.140,莞嫔娘娘吉祥,00:28:30.560,00:28:31.680,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:28:32.600,00:28:33.390,起来吧,00:28:32.000,00:28:32.980,Peace to Your Highness.
,,,00:28:33.480,00:28:34.400,Rise.
00:28:34.480,00:28:36.430,奉皇上旨意 晓谕六宫,00:28:35.300,00:28:36.640,"By His Majesty's decree,"
00:28:36.920,00:28:39.510,复年妃为华妃 钦此,00:28:36.640,00:28:39.700,"the palace is informed that Consort Nian
is reinstated to Consort Fleur."
00:28:40.400,00:28:41.990,知道了 你退吧,00:28:39.700,00:28:41.180,This is His Majesty’s decree.
,,,00:28:41.300,00:28:43.160,"Yes, you may take your leave."
00:28:46.640,00:28:48.270,你看说来就来了,00:28:47.500,00:28:49.300,It's happened.
00:28:49.360,00:28:50.670,娘娘不觉得意外吗,00:28:50.140,00:28:51.880,Your Majesty is not surprised?
00:28:51.800,00:28:53.190,迟早的事罢了,00:28:52.620,00:28:54.220,It was always expected.
00:28:53.680,00:28:56.310,就好像春天一到花一定会开,00:28:54.580,00:28:57.700,It is like the flowers blooming when spring comes.
00:28:56.920,00:28:58.750,只是开得太碍眼了,00:28:58.020,00:28:59.820,"But if the flowers are overly dazzling,"
00:28:59.240,00:29:00.270,不要也罢了,00:28:59.900,00:29:01.400,they need to be pruned.
00:29:04.400,00:29:06.190,恭喜娘娘 贺喜娘娘,00:29:05.240,00:29:08.180,Congratulations to Your Highness!
00:29:09.280,00:29:10.070,起来吧,00:29:10.120,00:29:10.920,Rise.
00:29:13.760,00:29:18.110,等了这么久 终于等到今日了,00:29:14.600,00:29:19.100,It's been such a long wait until today.
00:29:18.400,00:29:19.750,娘娘日夜思念皇上,,,
00:29:20.080,00:29:20.750,诚心可鉴,00:29:19.180,00:29:20.840,Your Highness thought of His Majesty day and night.
00:29:21.080,00:29:22.060,皇上终于感知,00:29:20.840,00:29:22.080,Your sincerity was seen.
00:29:22.360,00:29:23.670,又重新厚待娘娘了,00:29:22.080,00:29:24.820,"His Majesty finally relented, and now
highly favors Your Highness again."
00:29:24.440,00:29:26.110,也不知是不是这样,00:29:25.280,00:29:27.380,I don't really know if that is the case.
00:29:30.680,00:29:32.710,你说是不是像你们所说,00:29:31.560,00:29:33.600,Is it really like what you said —
00:29:33.200,00:29:35.070,皇上又重新厚待本宫了,00:29:34.140,00:29:36.020,that His Majesty highly favors me again?
00:29:35.760,00:29:36.510,当然了,00:29:36.660,00:29:37.660,That's for sure.
00:29:36.800,00:29:38.630,娘娘一封一封的书折上去,00:29:37.700,00:29:39.600,Your Highness sent so many letters to His Majesty.
00:29:38.920,00:29:39.750,别说是皇上,00:29:39.640,00:29:40.800,Even I was moved.
00:29:40.200,00:29:42.150,就是奴才看了都不禁动容了,00:29:40.960,00:29:43.060,"Naturally His Majesty was, as well."
00:29:43.000,00:29:44.590,娘娘对皇上真心一片,00:29:43.860,00:29:46.020,His Majesty wouldn't fail to acknowledge
00:29:45.080,00:29:46.510,皇上不会不知道的,00:29:46.020,00:29:47.700,the sincerity of Your Highness.
00:29:47.720,00:29:48.910,当时流言如沸,,,
00:29:48.960,00:29:50.630,也不过是为了平息物议,00:29:48.480,00:29:49.940,Rumors were rampant
00:29:50.920,00:29:52.310,才不得不冷落娘娘,00:29:49.940,00:29:53.420,"so His majesty had to neglect
Your Highness to calm the unrest."
00:29:52.960,00:29:55.420,娘娘现在是守得云开见月明了,00:29:53.800,00:29:56.680,"The clouds have dispersed.
Your Majesty can now see the moon."
00:30:01.280,00:30:02.750,如今不知怎么的,00:30:01.980,00:30:03.460,I don't know why ...
00:30:03.600,00:30:05.390,心里总是患得患失,00:30:04.360,00:30:06.640,I'm always swayed by gains and losses.
00:30:07.400,00:30:09.190,跟了皇上这么多年,00:30:08.240,00:30:10.180,"After serving His Majesty all these years,"
00:30:10.280,00:30:12.030,倒觉得越发看不透他了,00:30:11.100,00:30:12.860,I can no longer see his heart.
00:30:13.160,00:30:14.380,别的看不透,,,
00:30:14.680,00:30:15.990,那皇上对娘娘的好,00:30:13.940,00:30:15.480,"Even if I see nothing else,"
00:30:16.440,00:30:17.660,那是看得透透的,00:30:15.480,00:30:18.660,anyone can see how fondly His Majesty favors Your Highness.
00:30:21.320,00:30:23.070,把圣旨好好收起来,00:30:22.160,00:30:23.920,Put the decree away.
00:30:24.400,00:30:27.830,贵妃不贵妃的本宫都不在意,00:30:25.360,00:30:28.800,I don't care about the rank of Noble Consort.
00:30:30.240,00:30:32.670,只要皇上心里有本宫就好,00:30:31.120,00:30:33.560,As long as His Majesty has me in his heart.
00:30:36.120,00:30:37.430,这是今年的新茶,00:30:36.940,00:30:38.300,It's this year's new tea.
00:30:37.760,00:30:39.510,姐姐尝尝看味道如何,00:30:38.520,00:30:41.020,"Meizhuang, please try and see if you like it."
00:30:44.440,00:30:47.230,味道很好 难为你还想着,00:30:45.260,00:30:46.660,It tastes good.
,,,00:30:46.660,00:30:48.500,Thank you for thinking of me.
00:30:47.920,00:30:50.110,最近少见姐姐在皇上跟前走动,00:30:48.700,00:30:51.160,I rarely see you around His Majesty recently.
00:30:50.680,00:30:53.710,所以惦记着特地来看看姐姐,00:30:51.440,00:30:54.820,So I've been thinking about visiting you.
00:30:54.280,00:30:55.630,春困秋乏,00:30:55.140,00:30:57.140,I feel dizzy in spring and fatigued in autumn.
00:30:56.040,00:30:58.270,我这个人本来就不爱热闹,00:30:57.140,00:30:59.300,And I dislike being in a bustling environment.
00:30:58.920,00:31:01.550,听闻姐姐幸得太后宠爱,00:30:59.880,00:31:02.600,"Meizhuang, I heard that you are favored by the Empress Dowager."
00:31:02.240,00:31:04.950,日日在寿康宫实在辛苦,00:31:03.100,00:31:05.940,"You've been working hard to
serve in the Palace of Longevity."
00:31:05.280,00:31:07.630,是太后不嫌弃我愚笨罢了,00:31:06.100,00:31:08.780,It's just that Her Majesty doesn't mind my lack of intelligence.
00:31:08.600,00:31:09.990,姐姐有太后眷顾,00:31:09.400,00:31:11.340,"Being in Her Majesty's good graces,"
00:31:10.720,00:31:12.270,自然可以高枕无忧,00:31:11.600,00:31:13.880,you certainly can reside in peace.
00:31:13.160,00:31:16.230,不像妹妹却是食不下咽,00:31:14.260,00:31:15.400,But I...
00:31:16.840,00:31:17.710,怎么会呢,00:31:15.880,00:31:17.660,I haven't been able to eat or sleep well.
,,,00:31:17.680,00:31:18.780,Why?
00:31:18.360,00:31:21.070,什么事都有皇上替你做主啊,00:31:19.140,00:31:22.020,His Majesty treats you fairly in all things.
00:31:21.280,00:31:23.910,可偏偏是皇上下旨重定华妃,00:31:22.100,00:31:25.020,"But it's His Majesty who made the decree
to restore Consort Fleur's title."
00:31:25.040,00:31:27.830,我一想到从前华妃种种欺凌践踏,00:31:25.920,00:31:29.360,"When I think about how Consort Fleur
used to ""tread upon me"","
00:31:28.560,00:31:30.150,就吓得晚上睡不着觉,00:31:29.660,00:31:31.480,I can't even fall asleep.
00:31:30.920,00:31:32.190,华妃重定,00:31:31.940,00:31:33.220,Reinstating Consort Fleur ...
00:31:33.520,00:31:34.500,看来,00:31:34.400,00:31:35.380,It seems ...
00:31:35.000,00:31:37.560,皇上是忘了嬛儿的失子之痛了,00:31:35.960,00:31:38.600,"His Majesty has forgotten how painfully
Huan'er lost her child."
00:31:38.800,00:31:40.750,真叫人寒心哪,00:31:39.600,00:31:41.560,It's so bitterly disappointing.
00:31:41.360,00:31:43.070,我们从前的种种功夫,00:31:42.120,00:31:44.120,All our previous efforts
00:31:43.560,00:31:44.780,都算是白费了,00:31:44.400,00:31:45.940,have been futile.
00:31:46.280,00:31:48.270,皇上跟前我插不上话,00:31:47.340,00:31:49.860,My words don't carry much weight before His Majesty.
00:31:49.520,00:31:51.150,但是妹妹不一样啊,00:31:50.400,00:31:52.160,"But you are different, Lingrong."
00:31:51.400,00:31:53.190,只要能得皇上的宠爱,,,
00:31:53.600,00:31:55.470,什么话皇上都爱听的,00:31:52.220,00:31:56.580,His Majesty listens to whoever is in his favor.
00:31:56.280,00:31:57.470,姐姐是怪我吗,00:31:57.140,00:31:58.900,"Meizhuang, are you blaming me?"
00:31:58.960,00:32:00.390,惠贵人错怪小主了,00:31:59.800,00:32:01.720,"Lady Vertu, you wronged Lady An."
00:32:01.000,00:32:02.510,不是小主不劝皇上,00:32:02.000,00:32:03.920,It's not that Lady An didn't advise against the decree.
00:32:03.040,00:32:05.600,而是莞嫔娘娘劝皇上重定华妃,00:32:04.180,00:32:06.960,"Instead, it was Concubine Sourire who
suggested the reinstatement."
00:32:06.720,00:32:07.430,胡说什么,,,
00:32:08.200,00:32:08.950,奴婢不敢,00:32:07.440,00:32:08.840,You're talking nonsense.
00:32:09.360,00:32:10.990,奴婢也是听小厦子说起来,00:32:09.020,00:32:10.440,"I dare not lie to you, My Lady."
00:32:11.240,00:32:12.110,才知道的,00:32:10.440,00:32:12.820,I heard this from Xiao-Xiazi.
00:32:14.200,00:32:15.150,你没有听错吗,00:32:15.060,00:32:16.420,Did you mishear it?
00:32:15.600,00:32:17.390,小厦子是御前伺候的人,00:32:16.520,00:32:18.560,Xiao-Xiazi serves His Majesty directly.
00:32:17.760,00:32:18.550,不会有错,00:32:18.640,00:32:20.040,He couldn't be misinformed.
00:32:22.240,00:32:24.830,姐姐 莞姐姐怎么会如此,00:32:23.120,00:32:25.720,"Meizhuang, why would Sourire do this?"
00:32:25.160,00:32:27.510,外头的闲言闲语做不得数的,00:32:25.980,00:32:28.480,The gossip spread without any substance.
00:32:27.880,00:32:29.150,嬛儿最恨华妃,,,
00:32:29.480,00:32:30.390,她不会如此,00:32:28.740,00:32:30.300,Huan'er hates Consort Fluer the most.
00:32:31.040,00:32:32.470,可是 上一次,00:32:30.300,00:32:31.680,She wouldn't do this.
,,,00:32:31.840,00:32:33.040,"But last time,"
00:32:32.720,00:32:34.510,也是莞姐姐劝皇上去见华妃的,00:32:33.040,00:32:35.560,Sourire also persuaded His Majesty to see Consort Fleur.
00:32:34.680,00:32:35.350,好了,00:32:35.560,00:32:36.540,Enough.
00:32:36.080,00:32:38.430,嬛儿有话自然会跟我说,00:32:37.020,00:32:39.460,"If Huan'er have something to tell me, she will."
00:32:38.920,00:32:41.030,没有和我说就是没有做过,00:32:39.760,00:32:42.120,"If she didn't tell me, it didn't happen."
00:32:41.600,00:32:43.950,咱们也用不着听这些闲言闲语,00:32:42.420,00:32:44.960,Let's not let gossip upset us.
00:32:44.680,00:32:45.710,时候不早了,,,
00:32:46.200,00:32:47.340,我要去看望太后,00:32:45.600,00:32:48.420,It's time that I should visit Her Majesty.
00:32:47.920,00:32:49.030,就不留妹妹了,00:32:48.740,00:32:50.180,I won't keep you then.
00:32:51.000,00:32:52.030,那妹妹先走了,00:32:51.840,00:32:53.100,I shall take my leave.
00:33:00.080,00:33:02.950,小主 安贵人说得有鼻子有眼,00:33:00.960,00:33:02.180,"My Lady,"
00:33:03.200,00:33:04.670,恐怕未必是空穴来风,00:33:02.180,00:33:04.100,Lady An was very assertive and knew all the details.
,,,00:33:04.260,00:33:05.980,"I'm afraid this wasn't ""wind from an empty cave ""."
00:33:05.520,00:33:06.390,我知道,00:33:06.560,00:33:07.580,I know.
00:33:07.080,00:33:09.030,所以必得问了嬛儿才明白,00:33:07.900,00:33:09.860,So I have to ask Huan'er first.
00:33:09.960,00:33:12.550,若真是她劝皇上重定华妃,00:33:10.840,00:33:13.820,"If she did persuade His Majesty to restore Consort Fleur,"
00:33:13.080,00:33:14.870,那也不算是我的好姐妹了,00:33:13.960,00:33:16.040,I will no longer see her as my sister.
00:33:15.840,00:33:19.830,可是我总觉得她不至如此,00:33:16.680,00:33:20.720,But I think she didn't have to go that far.
00:33:34.280,00:33:35.670,臣妾给太后请安,,,
00:33:36.040,00:33:37.100,太后万福金安,00:33:35.080,00:33:36.800,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:33:38.240,00:33:39.270,起来说话吧,00:33:36.840,00:33:38.400,May peace and grace be with Your Majesty.
00:33:39.760,00:33:40.590,谢太后,00:33:39.100,00:33:40.520,Rise. I need to talk to you.
00:33:40.840,00:33:41.750,坐着说吧,00:33:40.600,00:33:41.560,I thank Your Majesty.
,,,00:33:41.620,00:33:42.660,You may sit.
00:33:42.960,00:33:46.580,有些日子没好好地跟你说话了,00:33:43.760,00:33:47.620,I haven't spoken with you for a long time.
00:33:47.840,00:33:49.390,最近都忙着什么呢,00:33:48.740,00:33:50.860,What have you been busy with recently?
00:33:50.960,00:33:52.230,臣妾无事可忙,00:33:51.920,00:33:53.460,"I have nothing that occupies me,"
00:33:52.680,00:33:54.870,左不过是打发时间而已,00:33:53.620,00:33:55.960,just finding ways to pass the time.
00:33:55.480,00:33:58.550,那就说说怎么打发时间的事情,00:33:56.420,00:33:57.580,Then tell me
,,,00:33:57.760,00:33:59.760,how you spend your time.
00:33:59.400,00:34:01.350,哀家听着也解解乏,00:34:00.440,00:34:02.660,I will feel refreshed hearing about it.
00:34:03.640,00:34:07.110,内务府给御花园里送了两只仙鹤,00:34:04.440,00:34:08.180,"The Household Department sent
two cranes to the Imperial Garden."
00:34:07.440,00:34:08.470,长得挺漂亮的,00:34:08.320,00:34:09.560,They look beautiful.
00:34:09.280,00:34:11.710,和园子里原来那两只梅花鹿,00:34:10.120,00:34:13.680,"Together with the two sika deers in the garden,"
00:34:12.040,00:34:12.790,凑在一块,,,
00:34:13.240,00:34:15.830,正应了鹿鹤长春的景儿,00:34:13.920,00:34:17.260,"they conceive the scene of
""longevity and long-lasting spring""."
00:34:18.040,00:34:19.180,这药好苦啊,00:34:18.980,00:34:20.520,The medicine is so bitter.
00:34:19.680,00:34:21.350,喝得人舌头都木了,00:34:20.640,00:34:22.180,It numbed my tongue.
00:34:24.960,00:34:25.710,太后,00:34:25.860,00:34:27.000,Your Majesty.
00:34:31.560,00:34:33.670,太后 这是新制的山碴,00:34:32.400,00:34:34.500,"Your Majesty, here are some preserved hawthorn fruits."
00:34:34.000,00:34:34.950,酸甜开胃的,,,
00:34:35.200,00:34:35.830,您刚喝了药,00:34:34.500,00:34:36.080,Sweet-and-sour will calm the Stomach.
00:34:36.160,00:34:37.550,用这个是最好不过了,00:34:36.120,00:34:38.520,They are the best after taking medicine.
00:34:39.320,00:34:41.430,还是你这个孩子有孝心,00:34:40.200,00:34:42.320,"You are so filial, as always."
00:34:51.240,00:34:52.190,果然不错,00:34:51.880,00:34:53.200,It tastes good.
00:34:52.560,00:34:54.070,太后喜欢就好了,00:34:53.460,00:34:55.160,I‘m glad Your Majesty likes it.
00:34:54.440,00:34:56.820,臣妾是想着这药极苦,00:34:55.280,00:34:57.840,The medicine is extremely bitter.
00:34:57.200,00:34:59.710,若食极甜之物 口中反而难受,00:34:57.960,00:35:00.820,"Your Majesty may feel sick if you eat
something too sweet."
00:35:00.040,00:35:02.470,不若酸甜来得可口一些,00:35:00.880,00:35:03.500,Sweet-and-sour is a more pleasant flavor.
00:35:07.440,00:35:09.820,莞嫔 你可知罪,00:35:08.240,00:35:09.580,"Concubine Sourire,"
,,,00:35:09.680,00:35:11.680,have you recognized your offense?
00:35:13.480,00:35:16.110,臣妾惶恐不知 还请太后明示,00:35:14.360,00:35:17.300,"Your Majesty, I'm frightened and unaware.
Please enlighten me."
00:35:16.600,00:35:18.030,你好大的胆子,00:35:17.480,00:35:18.920,How dare you!
00:35:18.960,00:35:21.750,竟敢以妃嫔之身干预朝政,00:35:19.840,00:35:22.600,You dared to interfere with state affairs as a concubine.
00:35:22.120,00:35:23.430,太后 她,00:35:22.800,00:35:24.060,"Your Majesty, she..."
00:35:23.680,00:35:25.870,哀家问她呢 你慌张什么,00:35:24.060,00:35:25.440,I asked her.
,,,00:35:25.760,00:35:27.460,Why are you so flustered?
00:35:27.440,00:35:29.470,臣妾不知太后为何要这样说,00:35:28.320,00:35:30.720,I don't know why Your Majesty said so.
00:35:31.000,00:35:34.190,可是臣妾实在不敢犯这样的死罪,00:35:31.880,00:35:35.280,But I would never dare to commit such a heinous crime.
00:35:35.600,00:35:37.070,哀家准你自己说,00:35:36.480,00:35:38.560,I will allow you to confess.
00:35:38.280,00:35:39.790,追封太妃一事,00:35:39.120,00:35:40.860,How much were you involved
00:35:40.520,00:35:42.070,你有多少参与其中,00:35:40.860,00:35:43.060,in the promotion of the Consort Dowagers?
00:35:42.400,00:35:43.270,太后明鉴,,,
00:35:44.080,00:35:45.470,臣妾再年轻不懂事,00:35:43.180,00:35:45.040,I believe Your Majesty will make a fair judgment.
00:35:45.760,00:35:47.110,也知道后宫不得干政,00:35:45.100,00:35:48.300,"I have always remembered that the harem
must not interfere with state affairs."
00:35:48.120,00:35:49.390,皇上是圣明之君,00:35:49.080,00:35:50.820,His Majesty is a wise emperor.
00:35:50.000,00:35:52.150,追封太妃之事心中早有决断,00:35:50.940,00:35:53.180,He had already decided to promote the Consort Dowagers.
00:35:52.640,00:35:53.910,岂是臣妾可以左右,00:35:53.440,00:35:55.160,I could never sway His Majesty's decision.
00:35:54.880,00:35:55.750,臣妾愚昧,00:35:55.780,00:35:57.080,"I was mistaken,"
00:35:56.920,00:35:58.910,以为追封太妃是后宫之事,00:35:57.860,00:36:00.300,"thinking that promoting the
Consort Dowagers was a family matter,"
00:35:59.440,00:36:00.870,才敢略说一二句话,00:36:00.300,00:36:01.900,so I dared to say a little.
00:36:01.480,00:36:02.310,若说朝政,,,
00:36:03.440,00:36:05.110,是绝不敢有丝毫沾染的,00:36:02.360,00:36:06.100,"If affairs of state had been discussed,
I would never dare to interfere at all."
00:36:05.920,00:36:08.030,纵使你无意于朝政大事,00:36:06.800,00:36:09.000,"Even if you have no intention of being
involved in state affairs,"
00:36:09.160,00:36:12.860,你敢说这件事中你没有半点私心,00:36:09.960,00:36:14.060,"you dare to say you have no
self-interest in this matter?"
00:36:13.720,00:36:15.110,臣妾不敢欺瞒太后,00:36:14.600,00:36:16.520,I dare not deceive Your Majesty.
00:36:16.520,00:36:17.870,皇上是一国之君,,,
00:36:18.520,00:36:20.510,总忧心于朝政 废寝忘食,00:36:17.600,00:36:19.420,"His Majesty, as the head of state,"
00:36:21.560,00:36:22.830,臣妾得幸于皇上,00:36:19.440,00:36:22.120,"is always worried about state affairs,
and neglecting to eat and sleep."
00:36:23.600,00:36:24.740,能够侍奉左右,00:36:22.440,00:36:25.860,I’m fortunate to be able to serve His Majesty.
00:36:25.920,00:36:26.900,若有私心,00:36:26.760,00:36:28.500,"If I have self-interest,"
00:36:27.640,00:36:30.390,也是希望皇上能够万岁平安,00:36:28.600,00:36:31.720,it is only my hope that His Majesty could live forever in peace
00:36:31.480,00:36:34.270,臣妾也能得以眷顾 平安终老,00:36:32.400,00:36:35.340,and that I will be taken care of in my peaceful old age.
00:36:35.640,00:36:39.230,这点私心 后宫哪个嫔妃没有,00:36:36.500,00:36:40.180,"This self-interest, which concubine in the
harem does not have it?"
00:36:41.240,00:36:43.230,也罢 起来吧,00:36:42.100,00:36:44.300,"All right, you may rise."
00:36:44.360,00:36:45.190,谢太后,00:36:45.200,00:36:46.440,I thank Your Majesty.
00:36:52.320,00:36:55.510,你的私心 人人都是一样的,00:36:53.240,00:36:56.580,Your self-interest is the same as anyone else's.
00:36:56.400,00:36:57.990,有了皇帝才有你们,00:36:57.240,00:36:59.240,Your lives all depend on the Emperor.
00:36:59.080,00:37:01.510,皇帝在 这后宫里,00:36:59.960,00:37:01.460,"As long as the Emperor is here,"
00:37:01.760,00:37:03.870,不管是得宠的或者是失宠的,00:37:01.460,00:37:04.980,all concubines regardless of their status and favor
00:37:04.680,00:37:07.510,终究还有个指望 还有个盼头,00:37:05.500,00:37:08.620,will still have a life to look forward to.
00:37:08.600,00:37:10.110,如果皇帝不在了,00:37:09.520,00:37:11.680,"If the Emperor is gone,"
00:37:10.960,00:37:12.790,皇后自然是没说的,00:37:11.880,00:37:13.620,"the Empress of course,"
00:37:13.560,00:37:14.590,贵为太后,00:37:14.500,00:37:16.260,will be the distinguished Empress Dowager.
00:37:16.200,00:37:17.550,就像曹贵人,00:37:17.080,00:37:18.460,"And Lady Cao, for instance,"
00:37:18.000,00:37:20.460,她起码还有个女儿可以依靠,00:37:18.740,00:37:21.300,she at least has a daughter to rely on.
00:37:21.240,00:37:23.990,可是像你和眉儿这些没有孩子的,00:37:22.060,00:37:24.980,But childless concubines like you and Meizhuang ...
00:37:26.800,00:37:30.870,尽管眼下风光 只怕晚景凄凉,00:37:27.660,00:37:29.800,"Despite your current glories,"
,,,00:37:29.880,00:37:31.880,I fear your old age will look bleak.
00:37:31.800,00:37:35.420,说穿了 不过是在等死罢了,00:37:32.560,00:37:34.240,"To put it bluntly,"
00:37:37.320,00:37:39.190,所以你们能指望的,00:37:34.480,00:37:36.480,just waiting for death.
00:37:40.280,00:37:41.830,也只有皇帝一人,00:37:38.200,00:37:42.900,"So, the Emperor is the only one
you can rely on right now."
00:37:45.560,00:37:46.620,听皇帝说,00:37:46.360,00:37:47.800,The Emperor told me
00:37:49.680,00:37:53.790,华妃尽早重定一事是你的主意,00:37:50.520,00:37:54.780,"that it was your idea to restore Consort Fleur's
status as soon as possible."
00:37:58.120,00:37:58.870,是,00:37:58.920,00:37:59.780,Yes.
00:37:59.600,00:38:00.910,你倒肯,00:38:00.460,00:38:02.000,Was that against your will?
00:38:02.200,00:38:03.180,太后英明,00:38:03.080,00:38:04.400,Your Majesty is wise.
00:38:04.280,00:38:07.150,太后适才说 有人要逆天而行,00:38:05.220,00:38:08.420,Your Majesty is aware that someone is plotting against Heaven.
00:38:08.400,00:38:09.590,臣妾虽然愚钝,00:38:09.320,00:38:10.760,"Though I am dim-witted,"
00:38:10.400,00:38:11.750,却也明白太后所指,00:38:11.280,00:38:12.960,I understand who Your Majesty refers to.
00:38:13.520,00:38:14.710,恳请太后明鉴,00:38:14.360,00:38:15.940,Your Majesty has eyes like mirrors —
00:38:15.800,00:38:18.390,局势之下前朝要安抚人心,00:38:16.540,00:38:20.940,"in this situation, it is necessary
to calm both the court and the harem."
00:38:18.960,00:38:19.750,后宫也要,,,
00:38:20.880,00:38:22.590,臣妾不能为了一己私怨,,,
00:38:23.160,00:38:24.470,而干扰国事大局,00:38:21.840,00:38:25.500,"I cannot interfere with state affairs
for the sake of my personal grievances."
00:38:25.680,00:38:29.270,这件事情总得有人受委屈,00:38:26.760,00:38:28.300,In this matter ...
,,,00:38:28.840,00:38:30.780,someone has to bear the injustice.
00:38:30.600,00:38:32.510,臣妾情愿自己受这个委屈,00:38:31.400,00:38:33.700,I would rather that person be me.
00:38:36.840,00:38:37.750,好孩子,00:38:37.660,00:38:38.940,"Sourire,"
00:38:39.600,00:38:41.670,哀家不料你有这样的心气,00:38:40.480,00:38:42.900,I didn't expect you to have such a heart.
00:38:44.000,00:38:45.910,难怪皇帝偏疼你,00:38:44.960,00:38:47.080,"No wonder the Emperor is partial to you,"
00:38:46.240,00:38:47.910,准你入御书房陪伴,00:38:47.080,00:38:49.100,allowing you to accompany him in the Imperial Study.
00:38:50.000,00:38:51.030,太后言重了,,,
00:38:51.320,00:38:52.790,臣妾不敢承受,00:38:50.880,00:38:52.220,"I'm flattered, Your Majesty."
,,,00:38:52.220,00:38:53.960,I do not deserve you saying that.
00:38:54.200,00:38:56.150,哀家原本听皇后说,00:38:55.040,00:38:57.600,When the Empress told me that
00:38:57.000,00:39:00.510,你在御书房陪伴皇帝 甚是妥当,00:38:57.820,00:39:01.580,"you were very conscientious
serving the Emperor in the Imperial Study,"
00:39:01.040,00:39:02.430,哀家是不放心,00:39:01.820,00:39:03.640,I was not at ease.
00:39:03.480,00:39:07.100,御书房岂是后妃能够擅入之处,00:39:04.420,00:39:08.100,No concubine is at liberty to enter the Imperial Study.
00:39:07.760,00:39:09.910,你又一向是个聪明伶俐的,00:39:08.660,00:39:11.020,And you've always been the smart one.
00:39:10.880,00:39:13.150,若这聪明没有用在正途,00:39:11.680,00:39:14.700,"If this cleverness is not used in the right way,"
00:39:13.800,00:39:15.430,或是一味怂恿皇帝,00:39:14.700,00:39:16.860,or it blindly leads the Emperor
00:39:15.920,00:39:18.750,按着一己的好恶来处理国事,,,
00:39:19.000,00:39:20.310,或者用人刑罚,00:39:16.860,00:39:21.780,"to handle state affairs or impose punishments according to your personal interests,"
00:39:21.000,00:39:22.590,成为国之祸水,00:39:21.780,00:39:23.760,you will bring disaster to the nation
00:39:23.280,00:39:25.660,哀家断断不会容你,00:39:24.080,00:39:26.600,and I will not tolerate you.
00:39:26.800,00:39:27.670,臣妾不敢,00:39:27.680,00:39:29.200,"I dare not, Your Majesty."
00:39:28.440,00:39:30.030,好好服侍皇帝,00:39:29.380,00:39:31.180,Do your utmost in serving the Emperor.
00:39:31.040,00:39:33.990,早日有个一男半女的便是更好,00:39:31.980,00:39:34.940,And it will be even better if you can have a child soon.
00:39:35.000,00:39:35.910,多谢太后,00:39:35.840,00:39:37.120,I thank Your Majesty.
00:39:39.400,00:39:41.670,眉儿的性子沉稳持重,00:39:40.360,00:39:43.160,"Meizhuang has a calm temperament,"
00:39:42.320,00:39:44.700,你呢机灵慧敏,00:39:43.160,00:39:45.700,and you have a keen intellect.
00:39:45.320,00:39:46.910,纯元皇后过世后,00:39:46.200,00:39:48.320,"After Empress Première passed,"
00:39:47.640,00:39:48.620,皇帝身边,,,
00:39:49.160,00:39:51.350,总没有一个可心得力的人,00:39:48.580,00:39:52.520,the Emperor did not have any concubines truly to his liking.
00:39:53.160,00:39:56.270,你们如果可以尽心尽力侍奉在侧,00:39:54.100,00:39:57.360,"If you two can put all your heart into your service,"
00:39:56.720,00:39:59.310,皇帝也就没有后顾之忧了,00:39:57.520,00:40:00.320,the Emperor will have no worries in the harem.
00:39:59.720,00:40:02.430,太后太过于抬举臣妾了,00:40:00.500,00:40:03.380,Your Majesty flatters me immensely.
00:40:06.400,00:40:08.310,哀家午睡的时间到了,00:40:07.340,00:40:09.560,"It’s time for me to rest,"
00:40:09.000,00:40:11.030,你们且去随便逛逛吧,00:40:09.920,00:40:12.040,so you two go and enjoy the day.
00:40:16.480,00:40:17.700,臣妾告退,00:40:17.280,00:40:18.740,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:40:24.800,00:40:25.670,莞嫔,00:40:25.620,00:40:26.920,"Concubine Sourire,"
00:40:30.240,00:40:33.310,古语说女子无才便是德,00:40:30.800,00:40:32.260,There is an old saying:
,,,00:40:32.260,00:40:34.500,"""The lack of talent is the virtue in a woman."""
00:40:34.280,00:40:35.550,哀家觉得不通,00:40:35.040,00:40:36.920,I don’t think it makes sense.
00:40:36.720,00:40:40.310,可是太有才了 也会有薄命之嫌,00:40:37.600,00:40:41.300,But being too talented will lead to a hapless fate.
00:40:40.960,00:40:41.990,太可惜了,00:40:41.840,00:40:43.300,That would be a shame.
00:40:43.320,00:40:46.750,有才而知进退 福慧双修,00:40:44.020,00:40:46.480,A talented person knows when to advance and withdraw.
00:40:47.480,00:40:48.620,这才难得,00:40:46.480,00:40:48.300,They cultivate both blessing and wisdom.
,,,00:40:48.380,00:40:49.900,This is really rare.
00:40:50.000,00:40:53.310,这后宫里虽说你们只是一介女流,00:40:50.880,00:40:54.520,"In this harem, even though you are just a woman,"
00:40:53.960,00:40:55.910,却是个女人一哭一笑,00:40:54.800,00:40:57.100,it is a place where a woman’s tears and smiles
00:40:56.240,00:40:59.110,都能引发前朝风吹草动的地方,00:40:57.100,00:41:00.120,"can trigger the changes of ""winds and clouds"" in the court."
00:41:00.320,00:41:03.910,自己的一言一行谨慎着吧,00:41:01.260,00:41:03.000,What you say and do ...
,,,00:41:03.720,00:41:05.020,Be cautious.
00:41:05.120,00:41:05.750,是,00:41:05.980,00:41:06.840,Yes.
00:41:09.400,00:41:10.190,眉姐姐呢,00:41:10.200,00:41:11.420,Where’s Meizhuang?
00:41:10.840,00:41:12.470,带着宫女到小厨房去了,00:41:11.720,00:41:13.480,She took her maid to the kitchen.
00:41:13.200,00:41:15.070,大概是给太后做点心去了吧,00:41:14.000,00:41:16.140,Probably making desserts for Her Majesty.
00:41:16.600,00:41:18.030,怕一时半会儿见不着了,00:41:17.500,00:41:19.240,I'm afraid she won't be available.
00:41:19.480,00:41:20.390,我们先回去吧,00:41:20.380,00:41:21.720,Let’s go back.
,,,00:41:23.380,00:41:28.840,"""Lotuses are harvested south of River Yangtze."""
00:41:32.200,00:41:32.830,小主,00:41:29.920,00:41:33.080,"""How endless their verdant canopy expands!"""
00:41:34.520,00:41:35.230,说,00:41:33.160,00:41:34.120,My Lady.
00:41:36.320,00:41:37.270,今日午后,00:41:35.400,00:41:36.340,Speak.
00:41:37.800,00:41:38.750,奴婢见惠贵人,00:41:37.300,00:41:38.400,"This afternoon,"
00:41:39.040,00:41:40.510,气冲冲从寿康宫出来,00:41:38.700,00:41:41.600,"I saw Lady Vertu coming out of the
Palace of Longevity in anger."
00:41:41.120,00:41:42.870,过不多久莞嫔也出来了,00:41:41.900,00:41:43.940,Concubine Sourire also came out soon after.
00:41:43.600,00:41:44.070,不知道,,,
00:41:44.360,00:41:45.950,是不是惠贵人得罪了太后呢,00:41:44.400,00:41:46.960,I wonder if Lady Vertu offended the Empress Dowager.
00:41:46.520,00:41:48.790,得罪太后惠贵人怎么会生气,00:41:47.320,00:41:49.600,"How could she be angry if
she offended the Empress Dowager?"
00:41:50.080,00:41:51.790,让惠贵人如此生气的,,,
00:41:52.360,00:41:53.470,无非是她知道,00:41:50.980,00:41:54.460,What made her so angry was her knowing that
00:41:53.880,00:41:56.230,是莞嫔让皇上重定华妃的事,00:41:54.720,00:41:57.520,"it was Concubine Sourire who made
His Majesty reinstate Consort Fleur."
00:41:57.080,00:41:59.190,上次小主跟惠贵人这样说,00:41:57.820,00:42:00.280,"When you told her that the other day,"
00:41:59.520,00:42:00.390,她还偏不信,,,
00:42:00.960,00:42:02.710,我说的她未必全然不信,00:42:00.300,00:42:01.900,"she refused to believe you, My Lady."
,,,00:42:01.900,00:42:04.080,She was not entirely unconvinced.
00:42:03.560,00:42:06.070,凡事只有在起了疑心之后,00:42:04.480,00:42:07.160,She harbored suspicion and it was confirmed.
00:42:07.000,00:42:09.990,事情又被证实才会如此生气,00:42:07.960,00:42:11.120,That is why she was incensed.
00:42:10.640,00:42:11.910,我倒想看看,00:42:11.500,00:42:13.120,I would very much like to see
00:42:12.320,00:42:14.700,她平日里与莞嫔情同姐妹,00:42:13.260,00:42:15.900,whether someone who treats Concubine Sourire like a sister
00:42:15.440,00:42:16.990,是否真能深信不疑,00:42:16.220,00:42:17.880,will never doubt her sister
00:42:17.440,00:42:18.910,彼此全无嫌隙,00:42:18.400,00:42:20.020,and never develop a rift.
