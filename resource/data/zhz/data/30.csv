00:02:37.840,00:02:38.980,是她自己蠢,00:02:38.860,00:02:40.540,What a stupid fool!
00:02:40.200,00:02:41.910,身子不适也不早说,00:02:41.080,00:02:43.220,She didn't tell me she was feeling unwell!
00:02:43.200,00:02:44.510,莞嫔反复申述了,00:02:43.880,00:02:45.820,Concubine Sourire said she was ill several times.
00:02:45.080,00:02:46.140,娘娘只是不信,00:02:45.920,00:02:47.120,Your Highness didn't believe her ...
00:02:46.400,00:02:47.790,本宫哪知道她是真是假,00:02:47.260,00:02:49.100,How would I know if she was faking it?
00:02:48.560,00:02:51.670,她一向巧言令色 专与本宫作对,00:02:49.560,00:02:52.720,"She's always been a smooth talker, and always defying me."
00:02:53.520,00:02:54.390,怎么会,00:02:54.360,00:02:55.800,Why would she ...
00:02:56.040,00:02:57.750,她不是已经三个多月了吗,00:02:57.060,00:02:59.540,She had just entered her fourth month of pregnancy.
00:02:58.920,00:03:00.910,胎像应该已经很稳了,00:02:59.920,00:03:02.040,Her pregnancy should have been stable.
00:03:02.480,00:03:06.100,才跪了半个时辰就流血了,00:03:03.340,00:03:06.440,Why did she bleed after kneeling for just an hour?
00:03:07.320,00:03:08.300,太医说,00:03:08.140,00:03:09.800,The imperial doctor said ...
00:03:10.120,00:03:10.910,血,00:03:11.160,00:03:12.260,Blood ...
00:03:12.440,00:03:13.470,那些血,00:03:13.200,00:03:14.240,The blood ...
00:03:15.120,00:03:17.070,当年本宫的孩子没了,,,
00:03:18.640,00:03:20.590,地上也是那么一片血,00:03:16.000,00:03:21.300,I was bleeding when I had my miscarriage too.
00:03:21.360,00:03:22.070,娘娘,,,
00:03:23.040,00:03:24.350,不管是哪个太医说,00:03:22.060,00:03:23.240,"Your Highness,"
00:03:24.760,00:03:25.820,跪半个时辰不要紧的,00:03:23.960,00:03:26.820,"even if a doctor said kneeling for an hour is fine,"
00:03:26.200,00:03:28.150,您也不能真的让她跪那么久啊,00:03:27.080,00:03:29.480,you can't really make her kneel for that long.
00:03:28.920,00:03:31.550,这凡事不怕一万 只怕万一呀,00:03:29.840,00:03:32.360,There's always a chance ...
00:03:34.240,00:03:35.630,你当时怎么就不劝,00:03:35.360,00:03:37.000,Why didn't you say so?
00:03:36.760,00:03:37.870,做什么事后诸葛,00:03:37.160,00:03:38.820,Now your hindsight is twenty-twenty!
00:03:38.080,00:03:38.790,娘娘息怒,,,
00:03:39.360,00:03:41.190,娘娘 您不要太生气,00:03:38.820,00:03:40.140,Your Highness!
00:03:41.560,00:03:42.470,当心您的身子啊,00:03:40.200,00:03:43.240,"Your Highness, for the good of your health, please don't be angry."

00:03:57.840,00:03:58.710,还没有消息,00:03:56.940,00:03:58.540,All the doctors are still gathered there
,,,00:03:58.700,00:04:00.260,but no news has come out.
00:04:02.360,00:04:04.110,贵人 好贵人,00:04:03.240,00:04:05.040,"Lady Cao, Noble Lady Cao,"
00:04:04.640,00:04:05.110,娘娘,,,
00:04:05.320,00:04:07.030,娘娘并不是存心要为难你的,00:04:05.380,00:04:07.660,Her Highness did not mean you any harm.
00:04:07.440,00:04:09.350,如今娘娘受了惊吓 又生气,00:04:08.300,00:04:10.220,Her Highness is frightened and angry.
00:04:09.880,00:04:11.790,您快给娘娘想个办法才是啊,00:04:10.560,00:04:12.880,You must think of a way to help Her Highness.
00:04:15.600,00:04:18.110,娘娘 不管莞嫔是否小产,00:04:16.640,00:04:19.160,"Your Highness, whether Concubine Sourire
had a miscarriage or not,"
00:04:18.800,00:04:19.910,皇上即刻回宫,,,
00:04:20.240,00:04:21.950,便是已经知道来龙去脉了,00:04:19.620,00:04:22.780,"His Majesty's immediate return shows
he has been informed of the incident."
00:04:22.800,00:04:23.830,娘娘为求自保,00:04:23.380,00:04:25.160,"For Your Highness to protect yourself,"
00:04:24.680,00:04:27.510,最好先服软 以免惹怒皇上,00:04:25.280,00:04:28.400,you might have to humble yourself to avoid angering His Majesty.
00:04:28.000,00:04:29.310,本宫凭什么服软,00:04:28.880,00:04:30.200,Why?
00:04:30.400,00:04:31.590,本宫又没有做错,00:04:31.320,00:04:32.720,I did nothing wrong.
00:04:31.840,00:04:33.910,娘娘是否做错真的要紧吗,00:04:32.780,00:04:34.860,That's not what matters right now.
00:04:34.320,00:04:35.950,要紧的是皇上怎么看,00:04:35.240,00:04:36.960,What matters is what His Majesty thinks.
00:04:36.880,00:04:38.470,娘娘服软并非认错,00:04:37.600,00:04:39.560,An apology doesn't mean Your Highness admits any fault.
00:04:39.120,00:04:40.470,而是做给皇上看,,,
00:04:41.280,00:04:43.150,以平息皇上的怒气,00:04:40.140,00:04:43.300,But acting humbly will quell His Majesty's anger.
00:04:43.400,00:04:44.430,本宫没做错,00:04:43.740,00:04:45.120,I did nothing wrong.
00:04:45.880,00:04:49.150,皇上回来自会查明真相的,00:04:46.860,00:04:50.140,His Majesty will ascertain the truth when he arrives.
00:04:49.840,00:04:52.670,是 皇上自是要查明真相的,00:04:50.880,00:04:53.240,"Yes, His Majesty will."
00:04:53.840,00:04:55.670,可看见莞嫔那个样子,00:04:54.700,00:04:56.740,But when he sees Concubine Sourire ...
00:04:56.360,00:04:57.750,皇上只会查证,,,
00:04:58.320,00:04:59.950,是谁让莞嫔出事的,00:04:57.520,00:05:00.980,"His Majesty will only investigate
how she was reduced to her condition."
00:05:00.920,00:05:02.350,不管莞嫔是否小产,00:05:01.640,00:05:03.580,"No matter Concubine Sourire lost her child or not,"
00:05:03.040,00:05:05.230,龙颜大怒必是意料之中了,00:05:03.920,00:05:06.320,His Majesty will be in fierce anger.
00:05:07.080,00:05:09.540,娘娘若还在意以后和皇上的恩情,00:05:07.980,00:05:10.740,"If Your Highness cares about His Majesty's favor in the future,"
00:05:10.760,00:05:12.510,不得不暂时低头啊,00:05:11.540,00:05:13.780,you have to hold your head down for now.
00:05:20.000,00:05:22.350,皇上 皇上,00:05:20.420,00:05:23.000,Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

00:05:28.560,00:05:29.990,莞嫔怎么还没有醒,00:05:28.820,00:05:30.940,Why is Concubine Sourire still unconscious?
00:05:31.480,00:05:34.110,娘娘骤然小产 十分伤身,00:05:32.460,00:05:35.100,Her Highness's sudden miscarriage greatly damaged her health.
00:05:34.800,00:05:37.590,且在午日下跪暴晒,00:05:35.680,00:05:40.360,"She also has heatstroke symptoms from
kneeling in the blazing sun at midday."
00:05:38.360,00:05:39.670,有中暑现象,,,
00:05:40.400,00:05:41.790,还需要喂药下去,,,
00:05:42.200,00:05:43.750,看看能不能清醒啊,00:05:41.340,00:05:44.680,We have to keep giving her medicine to help her revive.
00:05:59.160,00:05:59.830,朕来,00:06:00.000,00:06:01.300,I'll do it.
00:06:02.320,00:06:02.950,扶起来,00:06:03.220,00:06:04.440,Hold her up.
00:06:58.920,00:06:59.670,皇上知道,,,
00:06:59.920,00:07:01.550,是十七爷救我们小主回来的吗,00:06:59.720,00:07:02.220,Does His Majesty know that My Lady was saved by Lord XVII?
00:07:01.800,00:07:02.470,知道,00:07:02.640,00:07:03.640,He does.
00:07:04.240,00:07:05.350,皇上没说什么,,,
00:07:05.920,00:07:07.910,没有 皇上一知道小主出了事,00:07:05.300,00:07:06.740,Did His Majesty say something?
00:07:08.240,00:07:08.910,着急得不行,,,
00:07:09.280,00:07:11.070,就立刻吩咐銮驾回宫了,00:07:07.520,00:07:11.440,His Majesty hurried back upon hearing the news.
00:07:13.240,00:07:14.550,十七爷在什么地方,00:07:13.780,00:07:15.300,Where is Lord XVII?

00:07:22.720,00:07:23.830,那我先进去了,00:07:22.860,00:07:24.360,I'll return inside then.
00:08:24.640,00:08:26.710,是非对错 皇上自会有定夺,00:08:25.160,00:08:27.700,His Majesty will make a fair decision.
00:08:28.600,00:08:30.110,用不着你在这儿瞪着本宫,00:08:29.360,00:08:31.240,You don’t have to stare at me here.
00:08:30.960,00:08:31.670,眉姐姐,00:08:31.620,00:08:32.340,"Meizhaung,"

00:10:29.120,00:10:31.110,我的孩子,00:10:29.660,00:10:31.660,My child!
00:10:35.360,00:10:38.590,我的孩子 小主,00:10:35.980,00:10:37.360,My child!
,,,00:10:37.980,00:10:39.220,My Lady.
00:10:38.920,00:10:39.750,妹妹别哭了,00:10:39.220,00:10:40.640,Please don’t cry Sourire.
00:10:40.320,00:10:42.190,妹妹伤心 皇上更伤心,00:10:40.640,00:10:42.880,"If you are grieved, His Majesty will feel even deeper grief."
00:10:43.000,00:10:44.990,御驾一听到消息就赶回来了,00:10:43.000,00:10:45.380,The imperial carriages returned in haste upon hearing the news.
00:10:45.960,00:10:46.630,皇上,00:10:46.260,00:10:46.940,Your Majesty.
00:10:47.200,00:10:49.110,此刻还不是伤心的时候,00:10:47.480,00:10:49.500,This is no time for mourning.
00:10:49.520,00:10:51.230,莞嫔失子 并非天灾,,,
00:10:51.560,00:10:52.470,而是人祸呀,00:10:49.900,00:10:53.080,"Concubine Sourire has lost her child
through man-made, not natural causes."
00:11:03.520,00:11:04.630,贱人在哪里,00:11:04.420,00:11:05.540,Where is that shrew?
00:11:05.560,00:11:06.310,启禀皇上,00:11:06.400,00:11:07.160,"Your Majesty,"
00:11:08.080,00:11:09.870,华贵妃脱簪戴罪,00:11:08.580,00:11:11.300,Noble Consort Fleur has unfastened her hair and awaits judgment.
00:11:10.360,00:11:11.910,正跪候在碎玉轩门外,00:11:11.400,00:11:12.960,She is kneeling outside the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:11:16.200,00:11:17.030,传她进来,00:11:16.640,00:11:17.480,Bring her in.
00:11:17.680,00:11:18.310,嗻,00:11:17.880,00:11:18.520,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:11:30.080,00:11:33.070,娘娘 皇上传您进去呢,00:11:30.760,00:11:33.760,"Your Highness, His Majesty wants to see you."
00:11:35.280,00:11:36.710,莞嫔的孩子保住了吗,00:11:35.880,00:11:37.320,Has Concubine Sourire’s child been saved?
00:11:47.480,00:11:49.510,娘娘 小心您的身子啊,00:11:47.980,00:11:50.020,"Be careful, Your Highness!"
00:12:15.480,00:12:16.700,皇上万福金安,00:12:16.500,00:12:18.100,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:12:19.680,00:12:20.660,臣妾有罪,00:12:20.560,00:12:21.680,I am guilty.
00:12:21.920,00:12:23.510,今日莞嫔冲撞臣妾,00:12:22.960,00:12:24.560,"Concubine Sourire offended me today,"
00:12:24.320,00:12:27.270,臣妾本想略施小惩 以示告诫,00:12:24.560,00:12:27.880,and I only intended to impose a modest punishment as a warning.
00:12:27.960,00:12:29.710,并非有意害莞嫔小产,00:12:28.920,00:12:31.140,I didn't mean for her to miscarry.
00:12:30.440,00:12:32.190,臣妾也不知为何会这样,00:12:31.460,00:12:33.440,I don't understand how this happened.
00:12:32.880,00:12:33.790,还望皇上,00:12:33.940,00:12:35.460,I hope Your Majesty
00:12:35.240,00:12:36.870,饶恕臣妾无知之罪,00:12:36.280,00:12:38.020,will pardon my ignorant offense.
00:12:37.560,00:12:38.430,你无知,00:12:38.900,00:12:40.160,Were you ignorant?
00:12:40.720,00:12:42.430,莞嫔有孕三个月,,,
00:12:43.320,00:12:44.110,你不知道吗,00:12:41.880,00:12:45.180,"Did you not know that Concubine Sourire
was three months pregnant?"
00:12:44.920,00:12:46.030,皇上 皇上,,,
00:12:47.000,00:12:47.950,贵妃娘娘说,00:12:46.000,00:12:47.240,"- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty,"
00:12:48.240,00:12:50.750,她正是因为知道莞嫔有孕三个月,00:12:47.980,00:12:51.200,"Her Imperial Highness insisted that
Concubine Souire's pregnancy was stable"
00:12:51.040,00:12:53.030,胎像稳固 才让她跪的,00:12:51.260,00:12:54.100,and that was the reason she could kneel for so long.
00:12:54.520,00:12:55.350,臣妾无知,00:12:55.500,00:12:56.940,"Your Majesty, I didn't know!"
00:12:56.200,00:12:58.580,臣妾今日是被气昏了头,00:12:57.520,00:12:59.800,I completely lost my head today.
00:12:59.440,00:13:02.270,想着跪上半个时辰应该不打紧,00:13:00.400,00:13:03.380,I thought it would be fine for her to kneel for an hour.
00:13:06.440,00:13:07.870,你这个太医是怎么当的,00:13:07.380,00:13:09.220,What kind of doctor are you?
00:13:09.000,00:13:10.950,她明明已经有三个多月的身孕,,,
00:13:11.440,00:13:13.110,怎么跪了半个时辰就会小产,00:13:09.820,00:13:14.120,How could she have a miscarriage after kneeling for just an hour?
00:13:13.640,00:13:15.350,一定是你们给她吃错了什么东西,,,
00:13:15.680,00:13:16.660,还要赖在本宫头上,00:13:14.860,00:13:17.840,"What tonic did you give her and now
you're trying to blame it on me?"
00:13:18.240,00:13:20.670,莞嫔娘娘之前是有不适之症,00:13:19.140,00:13:21.820,Her Highness has been feeling unwell recently
00:13:21.400,00:13:24.270,此乃盛夏母体孱弱之缘故,,,
00:13:24.680,00:13:26.070,也属正常现象,00:13:22.400,00:13:27.240,but that is normal for expectant mothers during the hot summer.
00:13:26.920,00:13:28.230,唯有不妥的是,00:13:27.940,00:13:29.420,But there is another factor.
00:13:28.680,00:13:31.350,莞嫔娘娘近日心神不宁,00:13:29.480,00:13:32.500,"Her Highness has been experiencing anxiety recently,"
00:13:31.800,00:13:33.230,所以胎像不稳,,,
00:13:33.840,00:13:35.550,这本来没有大的妨碍,00:13:32.720,00:13:34.580,which caused instability in her pregnancy.
00:13:36.080,00:13:39.070,只要好好休息便是了,00:13:34.740,00:13:40.020,But that wouldn't have been an issue if Her Highness had continued resting.
00:13:40.480,00:13:41.620,臣妾听闻,,,
00:13:42.120,00:13:45.190,那年侧福晋跪了两个时辰才小月的,00:13:41.420,00:13:46.160,"Your Majesty, I heard your Lord Consort had a
miscarriage after kneeling for four hours."
00:13:45.960,00:13:46.940,所以,00:13:46.680,00:13:47.780,That's why...
00:13:48.000,00:13:50.670,所以以为跪上半个时辰不打紧,00:13:48.860,00:13:52.700,"That's why I thought it would be fine for
Concubine Sourire to kneel for only an hour."
00:13:52.400,00:13:56.750,侧福晋当日是对纯元皇后大不敬,00:13:53.280,00:13:55.720,The Lord Consort was punished that day
00:13:57.400,00:14:00.430,纯元皇后才罚她下跪认错,00:13:55.860,00:14:01.580,for her major disrespect to Empress Première.
00:14:01.440,00:14:03.630,何况纯元皇后当时,,,
00:14:04.720,00:14:08.150,丝毫不知侧福晋已经身怀有孕,00:14:02.520,00:14:09.280,"Besides, Empress Première was entirely unaware
 that my Lord Consort was pregnant."
00:14:09.040,00:14:10.470,当属无心之失,00:14:09.920,00:14:11.900,It was an honest mistake.
00:14:13.200,00:14:14.510,纯元仁慈,00:14:14.080,00:14:15.740,Empress Première had a kind heart.
00:14:15.960,00:14:17.550,为此事自责不已,00:14:16.980,00:14:18.900,"She was consumed with guilt for her mistake,"
00:14:18.960,00:14:22.310,才伤及自身以致难产血崩,00:14:19.800,00:14:23.600,"and that caused her to experience
difficult labor and excessive bleeding."
00:14:22.760,00:14:23.670,而你,00:14:23.840,00:14:25.000,But you!
00:14:26.360,00:14:27.670,你明知道莞嫔,,,
00:14:28.640,00:14:31.100,怀有龙胎还强行责罚,00:14:27.320,00:14:32.000,"You clearly knew Concubine Sourire was
pregnant and forcibly punished her."
00:14:32.760,00:14:35.510,事后还不知悔改,00:14:33.820,00:14:36.820,And now you don't even show any remorse for your actions.
00:14:38.120,00:14:38.950,贱妇,00:14:39.080,00:14:40.460,Vile wretch!
00:14:40.200,00:14:42.350,如何敢和纯元相提并论,00:14:41.080,00:14:43.780,How dare you compare yourself to Empress Première!
00:14:45.760,00:14:47.070,是臣妾无知,00:14:46.540,00:14:48.120,I was ignorant.
00:14:47.800,00:14:49.190,朕看你不是无知,00:14:48.700,00:14:50.160,You were not ignorant.
00:14:50.280,00:14:51.590,倒是十分狠毒,00:14:51.300,00:14:52.900,You were intentionally cruel!
00:14:56.160,00:14:58.350,莞嫔若真的有错,00:14:57.120,00:14:59.640,"If Concubine Sourire really committed an offense,"
00:14:59.320,00:15:01.390,你为何不一早责罚她,00:15:00.280,00:15:02.680,why didn't you punish her early in the morning?
00:15:03.200,00:15:06.390,为何非要到日到中午,00:15:04.240,00:15:07.440,Why did you have to wait until noon
00:15:06.680,00:15:07.950,日头最毒的时候,00:15:07.440,00:15:09.120,to make her kneel in the scorching midday heat?
00:15:09.200,00:15:13.030,朕看你的心思真是毒如蛇蝎,00:15:10.240,00:15:14.120,"What a vicious heart ""like the snakes and scorpions""!"
00:15:13.840,00:15:17.190,朕的身边怎能容得下你这样的人,00:15:14.640,00:15:18.440,How can I allow your presence in my palace?
00:15:18.480,00:15:19.990,皇上 皇上,00:15:19.440,00:15:21.040,Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
00:15:20.400,00:15:21.750,臣妾是不喜欢莞嫔,00:15:21.200,00:15:23.280,It's true that I don't like Concubine Sourire.
00:15:22.880,00:15:24.190,自她进宫以来,00:15:23.800,00:15:25.840,"Ever since she entered the palace,"
00:15:25.120,00:15:27.710,皇上对臣妾就不如从前那般宠爱,00:15:26.180,00:15:28.860,Your Majesty stopped favoring me as before.
00:15:29.400,00:15:32.430,莞嫔恃宠而骄 凌辱臣妾,00:15:30.360,00:15:33.520,Concubine Sourire grew conceited over her favor and insulted me.
00:15:33.160,00:15:34.590,臣妾怎么能忍耐,,,
00:15:34.920,00:15:35.900,你太糊涂了,00:15:34.120,00:15:35.760,How could I possibly tolerate it?
00:15:36.440,00:15:37.950,枉费皇上对你的信任,00:15:35.820,00:15:37.280,You're such a fool!
,,,00:15:37.380,00:15:39.000,His Majesty trusted you to manage palace affairs.
00:15:38.440,00:15:40.030,让你协理六宫的事宜,00:15:39.400,00:15:41.000,Look how you have abused that trust!
00:15:40.440,00:15:43.790,臣妾是不满莞嫔处事嚣张,00:15:41.340,00:15:45.000,I've been displeased with Concubine Sourire's arrogant attitude.
00:15:45.040,00:15:46.310,可是臣妾从来都没有,,,
00:15:46.680,00:15:48.230,存心要害她的孩子,00:15:46.000,00:15:49.720,But I never harbored any intention to harm her child.
00:15:52.280,00:15:54.790,臣妾也是失去过孩子的人,00:15:53.040,00:15:55.840,I have the experience of losing my own child.
00:15:59.320,00:16:02.670,怎么可能如此心狠呢 皇上,00:16:00.300,00:16:04.160,How could I be so heartless to others?
00:16:10.760,00:16:14.070,己所不欲 勿施于人,00:16:11.800,00:16:15.260,"""If you don't want it to be done to you, don't do it to others."""
00:16:16.200,00:16:19.980,你自己也是有过丧子之痛的人,00:16:16.900,00:16:21.060,You have experienced the pain of losing a child.
00:16:21.680,00:16:25.790,怎么能忍心再加诸在莞嫔身上,00:16:22.840,00:16:26.900,"How could you inflict the same
upon Concubine Sourire?"
00:16:30.840,00:16:35.270,就算你无心伤害莞嫔腹中之子,00:16:31.700,00:16:36.100,"Even if you didn't intend to harm her child,"
00:16:36.040,00:16:38.230,这个孩子也是因为你而没了,00:16:36.940,00:16:39.480,her child was lost because of you.
00:16:39.080,00:16:40.270,你难辞其咎,00:16:39.920,00:16:41.720,You can't escape the responsibility.
00:16:42.880,00:16:46.350,你这样心如蛇蝎的人,,,
00:16:47.160,00:16:50.190,朕是断断不能一再容忍,00:16:43.880,00:16:50.960,"I can no longer tolerate ""a person with the heart of a snake and scorpion""."
00:16:52.440,00:16:54.310,请皇后晓谕六宫,00:16:53.480,00:16:56.340,The Empress will announce to the palace
00:16:58.320,00:16:59.950,废年氏贵妃之位,00:16:59.280,00:17:01.660,that Imperial Consort of the Nian Family
00:17:01.360,00:17:02.310,降为妃位,00:17:02.220,00:17:04.200,"is demoted to the rank of Consort,"
00:17:03.560,00:17:04.590,褫夺封号,00:17:04.580,00:17:06.580,and deprived of her honorary name
00:17:06.240,00:17:08.750,去协理六宫之权,00:17:07.160,00:17:09.920,and the power to assist in palace affairs.
00:17:10.200,00:17:12.630,日后非诏不得入见,00:17:11.040,00:17:13.860,She will not be seen unless summoned.
00:17:13.640,00:17:14.620,臣妾遵旨,00:17:14.500,00:17:16.280,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:17:15.480,00:17:17.780,那太后那边也要告知一声吗,00:17:16.680,00:17:18.800,Shall I inform Her Majesty as well?
00:17:20.120,00:17:21.710,富察贵人的孩子没了,,,
00:17:23.080,00:17:24.510,太后本就伤心,00:17:20.700,00:17:25.020,Her Majesty has been very sad about Lady Fuca's miscarriage.
00:17:26.000,00:17:27.220,如今又病着,00:17:26.000,00:17:27.220,"Now that she is unwell,"
00:17:28.040,00:17:29.470,未免雪上加霜,00:17:28.040,00:17:30.040,"this would be ""adding hail to the snow""."
00:17:31.600,00:17:33.900,就别再提了吧,00:17:32.500,00:17:34.800,So don't mention it to her.
00:17:35.880,00:17:39.310,太后那边 臣妾定会安排好一切,00:17:36.400,00:17:39.840,I'll be careful that Her Majesty will not be disturbed.
00:17:40.240,00:17:41.460,请皇上放心,00:17:40.900,00:17:42.120,Your Majesty need not worry.
00:17:42.600,00:17:43.550,皇上,00:17:43.300,00:17:44.260,"Your Majesty,"
00:17:44.560,00:17:46.390,臣妾无心之失,00:17:45.540,00:17:47.380,It was my unwitting mistake.
00:17:47.760,00:17:50.510,皇上真的要如此绝情吗,00:17:48.220,00:17:50.980,Will Your Majesty have mercy?
00:17:55.480,00:17:56.670,莞嫔何辜,00:17:56.360,00:17:57.560,But what was Concubine Sourire's mistake?
00:17:59.120,00:18:00.990,六宫的嫔妃何辜,00:18:00.000,00:18:01.880,And what was the mistake of all the concubines?
00:18:02.320,00:18:05.630,要陪着莞嫔一同暴晒在烈日之下,00:18:03.160,00:18:06.480,They all had to endure the scorching sun with Concubine Sourire!
00:18:11.280,00:18:12.230,从今日起,00:18:12.180,00:18:13.140,"From now on,"
00:18:13.720,00:18:16.350,你 每日正午,00:18:14.160,00:18:15.620,"every midday,"
00:18:16.880,00:18:20.270,去自己宫门口砖地上跪两个时辰,00:18:16.440,00:18:20.820,you will kneel at the gate of your palace for four hours.
00:18:24.800,00:18:25.550,出去,00:18:25.760,00:18:26.520,Get out!
00:18:33.720,00:18:34.470,娘娘,00:18:35.220,00:18:35.980,"Your Highness,"
00:19:04.960,00:19:05.870,苏公公,00:19:05.660,00:19:06.580,"Mr. Su,"
00:19:06.800,00:19:09.030,皇上从未如此生过本宫的气,00:19:07.680,00:19:09.920,His Majesty has never been so angry at me before.
00:19:10.120,00:19:11.030,这该怎么办,00:19:10.880,00:19:11.800,What shall I do?
00:19:13.520,00:19:14.660,娘娘先请回吧,00:19:14.220,00:19:15.720,"Please go, Your Highness."
00:19:15.760,00:19:18.220,不过这事奴才不能不说娘娘一句,00:19:16.100,00:19:17.920,"Pardon me for saying this,"
00:19:18.720,00:19:20.150,您就是再不喜欢莞嫔,00:19:18.100,00:19:20.840,"no matter how much Your Highness dislikes Concubine Sourire,"
00:19:20.520,00:19:21.740,也不能这么气盛啊,00:19:20.980,00:19:22.560,you should not be that impulsive.
00:19:22.160,00:19:23.710,本宫真的是冤枉的,00:19:23.060,00:19:24.480,I'm wrongfully convicted.
00:19:25.080,00:19:26.990,那也得皇上相信才行啊,00:19:25.080,00:19:27.420,Only if His Majesty is willing to trust you.
00:19:30.880,00:19:31.670,回去吧,00:19:31.580,00:19:32.380,"Take care, Your Highness."
00:19:56.720,00:19:59.750,你们先出去吧 朕陪陪莞嫔,00:19:57.020,00:20:00.480,You may all leave. I will stay with Concubine Sourire.
00:20:00.520,00:20:01.230,是,00:20:01.220,00:20:01.940,Yes.
00:20:02.480,00:20:05.040,莞嫔 身体最要紧,00:20:03.220,00:20:05.780,"Concubine Sourire, your health is the most important."
00:20:06.080,00:20:08.990,来日方长 不要过分伤心,00:20:06.700,00:20:09.840,"You have ample years ahead of you.
Be measured in your grief."
00:20:37.880,00:20:38.790,这次,00:20:38.760,00:20:39.680,"Today,"
00:20:40.320,00:20:42.910,若不是老十七把你救出翊坤宫,00:20:41.060,00:20:43.660,if Lord XVII had not rescued you from the Palace of Earthly Honor
00:20:44.520,00:20:46.710,又及时地遣人来禀报朕,00:20:45.300,00:20:47.500,"and sent someone to inform me,"
00:20:48.320,00:20:49.790,事情还不知道要,,,
00:20:50.280,00:20:51.340,要糟到什么地步,00:20:48.740,00:20:51.560,it's hard to imagine how much worse it might have turned out.
00:20:52.240,00:20:53.910,已经坏到这般田地,00:20:52.740,00:20:54.420,How much worse ...
00:20:55.840,00:20:57.270,还能怎么样,00:20:56.260,00:20:57.700,can it turn out?
00:20:59.320,00:21:00.150,别难过了,00:20:59.820,00:21:01.160,Don't be so sad.
00:21:01.960,00:21:02.910,你还年轻,00:21:02.840,00:21:03.800,You are young.
00:21:04.240,00:21:05.460,等养好了身子,,,
00:21:06.000,00:21:07.350,咱们再生一个就是了,00:21:05.020,00:21:07.840,We'll easily have another child after your recovery.
00:21:16.680,00:21:17.710,敢问皇上,00:21:16.680,00:21:18.380,"Your Majesty,"
00:21:20.720,00:21:24.670,臣妾的孩子就这么白白地没了吗,00:21:21.200,00:21:22.800,"I venture to ask you,"
,,,00:21:23.500,00:21:25.320,Did my child just die for nothing?
00:21:27.360,00:21:29.870,怎么不杀了那个贱妇 以此泄恨,00:21:28.280,00:21:30.800,Why didn't you enact your wrath by killing that wretch?
00:21:41.800,00:21:43.470,现在正是用人之际,00:21:42.420,00:21:44.100,We are in pressing need for support in court.
00:21:44.320,00:21:45.910,眼下不能不顾及,00:21:45.040,00:21:46.640,I had to take that into account.
00:21:47.440,00:21:50.350,可她杀了皇上你的亲生孩子啊,00:21:47.720,00:21:50.980,But she has killed Your Majesty's child.
00:21:59.560,00:22:00.700,朕对不住你,00:22:00.140,00:22:01.280,It's all my fault.
00:22:07.480,00:22:08.750,其实你今日,00:22:08.460,00:22:10.180,But today ...
00:22:10.160,00:22:14.830,何必对年妃的话言听计从,00:22:11.360,00:22:15.660,Why did you have to be so obedient to Consort Nian?
00:22:15.280,00:22:17.630,让你跪你就跪 让你罚你就罚,00:22:16.300,00:22:18.600,You didn't have to kneel or submit to her punishment.
00:22:18.000,00:22:20.270,敬妃也在场 你何不求助于她,00:22:18.960,00:22:21.440,"Consort Estime was there.
Why didn't you seek help from her?"
00:22:20.720,00:22:22.990,皇上不是不知道年氏的性子,00:22:21.600,00:22:24.160,Your Majesty knows what kind of person Nian is.
00:22:24.280,00:22:25.950,敬妃如何劝得住,00:22:25.280,00:22:27.580,How could Consort Estime stop her?
00:22:26.960,00:22:29.550,又岂是臣妾一己之力可以对抗的,00:22:27.960,00:22:30.580,How could I possibly confront her?
00:22:31.360,00:22:33.110,何况今日的情形,00:22:32.480,00:22:34.480,"Under the circumstances,"
00:22:34.640,00:22:35.910,若再逆她心意,00:22:35.600,00:22:37.420,"had I disobeyed her orders,"
00:22:37.320,00:22:39.390,她更会借口逼迫臣妾,00:22:38.060,00:22:40.880,"she would have had more excuses to
impose punishments on me."
00:22:42.160,00:22:43.030,那么皇上,00:22:43.060,00:22:44.720,Why did Your Majesty ...
00:22:45.960,00:22:47.910,您又为何要给她这么大的权力,,,
00:22:48.360,00:22:49.390,让她协理后宫,00:22:46.920,00:22:50.600,why did you give her absolute power in palace affairs?
00:22:51.680,00:22:54.470,她心思狠毒 皇上你不是不知道,00:22:52.560,00:22:55.920,Your Majesty was not unaware of her cruelty.
00:22:56.240,00:22:59.830,当日眉姐姐 便是最好的例子,00:22:57.100,00:23:01.080,"You knew how she caused Meizhuang's
wrongful demotion and suffering."
00:23:03.400,00:23:04.540,你是在怪朕吗,00:23:04.420,00:23:05.700,Are you blaming me?
00:23:08.160,00:23:09.220,臣妾岂敢,00:23:09.160,00:23:11.120,How dare I?
00:23:12.400,00:23:13.150,嬛嬛,00:23:13.400,00:23:14.900,Huan Huan.
00:23:16.800,00:23:18.910,朕发誓,00:23:17.880,00:23:20.000,I swear to Heaven
00:23:20.160,00:23:21.990,一定会还你一个公道,00:23:20.660,00:23:23.120,that I will bring you justice.
00:23:24.480,00:23:28.870,那么就请皇上给臣妾一个准信儿,00:23:25.520,00:23:29.800,I request Your Majesty to tell me when.
00:23:29.760,00:23:30.900,总会有那么一天,00:23:30.700,00:23:32.120,One day.
00:23:33.160,00:23:38.390,失子之痛或许会随着时间淡去,00:23:34.160,00:23:39.140,The pain of losing a child might fade over time.
00:23:40.680,00:23:42.350,可年妃日日在眼前,00:23:41.600,00:23:43.680,But Consort Nian will continue to be in the palace.
00:23:43.640,00:23:45.710,臣妾怎能安然度日,00:23:44.700,00:23:47.400,How am I going to live my days like before?
00:23:47.640,00:23:48.510,而皇上,00:23:48.500,00:23:50.180,And Your Majesty ...
00:23:51.080,00:23:53.640,未必会不念昔日情意,00:23:52.160,00:23:55.120,you might become sentimental about the past.
00:24:01.080,00:24:01.910,嬛嬛,00:24:01.980,00:24:03.280,Huan Huan.
00:24:03.480,00:24:06.750,为了朕 再忍耐一些时候,00:24:04.420,00:24:07.600,Please try to endure this for a little longer.
00:24:08.280,00:24:09.190,别为难朕,00:24:09.120,00:24:10.440,Please do it for me.

00:24:32.560,00:24:33.540,你们先下去吧,,,
00:24:33.920,00:24:34.590,是,00:24:33.460,00:24:34.720,You may leave now.
00:24:37.200,00:24:38.070,等很久了,00:24:34.880,00:24:35.820,Yes.
00:24:40.200,00:24:41.260,跟着御驾赶回,00:24:38.060,00:24:39.720,You must have waited for a while.
00:24:41.560,00:24:42.590,本想去碎玉轩伺候,00:24:41.200,00:24:44.040,"I wanted to attend the Palace of Pearl Jade when I returned with His Majesty,"
00:24:43.200,00:24:45.150,谁知被太后叫到了宫中,00:24:44.120,00:24:46.360,but the Empress Dowager summoned me.
00:24:45.560,00:24:47.710,急了一宿了 问吧,00:24:46.440,00:24:48.740,You've been worried all night. Ask me.
00:24:48.160,00:24:48.870,莞嫔小主她,,,
00:24:49.160,00:24:50.070,孩子没有保住,00:24:49.060,00:24:50.100,Did Concubine Sourire ...
,,,00:24:50.100,00:24:51.240,Her child wasn't saved.
00:24:52.960,00:24:53.990,是微臣无能,00:24:54.020,00:24:55.260,It was my incompetence.
00:24:55.280,00:24:57.840,光顾着在太医院追逐名利,00:24:56.320,00:24:59.460,I was carried away by the competition for fame at the infirmary.
00:24:59.280,00:25:00.830,没有好好保护好小主,00:25:00.380,00:25:01.940,I didn't protect My Lady.
00:25:02.080,00:25:03.110,堂堂一个大男人,00:25:03.000,00:25:04.380,Why are you standing here crying?
00:25:03.680,00:25:04.710,伤心有什么用,00:25:04.680,00:25:05.440,You're a man!
00:25:05.360,00:25:06.790,别人若存了心要害她,00:25:06.240,00:25:08.260,She was harmed intentionally.
00:25:07.840,00:25:09.390,你一个太医又有什么用,00:25:08.920,00:25:11.020,What could a doctor have done?
00:25:11.800,00:25:13.070,还是微臣无能,00:25:12.800,00:25:14.540,I wish I could be more useful.
00:25:13.640,00:25:16.550,此时此刻 你也不便去碎玉轩,00:25:14.720,00:25:17.660,It's not a good time for you to attend at the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:25:17.080,00:25:18.550,一则惹嬛儿伤心,00:25:18.080,00:25:19.960,Huan'er will be sad when she sees you
00:25:19.160,00:25:22.430,二则 嬛儿的胎终究不是你担待的,00:25:20.260,00:25:23.280,and you didn't undertake any duty for her pregnancy.
00:25:22.840,00:25:24.060,你去了也不方便,00:25:23.820,00:25:25.480,It's not appropriate for you to go.
00:25:25.480,00:25:26.830,你若真有心帮她,,,
00:25:27.240,00:25:28.790,不如去仔细查看一下,00:25:26.260,00:25:28.180,"If you have the intention to help her,"
00:25:29.160,00:25:29.670,她这些日子,,,
00:25:30.000,00:25:31.630,所用安胎药的方子和药渣,00:25:28.200,00:25:32.300,"you can carefully examine her recent
prescriptions and leftover herbs."
00:25:32.200,00:25:34.630,看看是否有什么差错,00:25:33.080,00:25:35.800,See if there's anything wrong.
00:25:35.680,00:25:38.110,其实我总有些不安心,00:25:36.620,00:25:39.060,I have my concerns about this.
00:25:39.000,00:25:40.550,年妃纵然骄横,00:25:39.900,00:25:41.580,Consort Nian was overbearing
00:25:40.880,00:25:42.790,却也不敢这样明目张胆地,,,
00:25:43.080,00:25:44.140,和龙胎过不去,00:25:41.900,00:25:45.400,but she wouldn't dare to so blatantly harm an imperial heir.
00:25:45.440,00:25:48.230,小主嘱托 微臣记得了,00:25:46.520,00:25:49.340,"I will commit this to my care, My Lady."
00:25:49.200,00:25:51.550,这件事先不要告诉甄家,00:25:50.180,00:25:52.500,Don't inform the Zhen family yet.
00:25:51.880,00:25:53.270,我怕两位老人家受不了,00:25:52.800,00:25:54.380,Her parents would be overwhelmed by grief.
00:25:54.080,00:25:55.350,小主思虑周全,00:25:55.200,00:25:56.920,"That's very thoughtful of you, My Lady."
00:25:56.800,00:25:57.590,微臣知道,00:25:57.820,00:25:59.280,I understand.
00:26:03.920,00:26:04.630,皇上,00:26:04.980,00:26:06.080,Your Majesty.
00:26:05.720,00:26:07.190,都是些请安折子,00:26:06.620,00:26:08.380,Are those just routine greetings?
00:26:08.320,00:26:09.070,是啊,,,
00:26:09.880,00:26:10.630,搁这儿吧,00:26:09.400,00:26:10.380,Yes.
00:26:12.760,00:26:13.470,怎么了,00:26:10.880,00:26:12.100,Leave them there.
00:26:14.000,00:26:14.710,皇上,00:26:13.820,00:26:14.760,What's wrong?
,,,00:26:15.040,00:26:15.920,"Your Majesty,"
00:26:15.640,00:26:18.430,这是年大将军送来的请安折子,00:26:16.500,00:26:19.180,this one is from Great General Nian.
00:26:19.600,00:26:21.310,昨儿才一道请安折子,00:26:20.720,00:26:22.700,He already sent one in yesterday.
00:26:22.000,00:26:23.140,今儿又是一道,00:26:23.080,00:26:24.520,Now there's another.
00:26:24.400,00:26:27.870,他这个安请得也太勤了吧,00:26:25.440,00:26:28.920,How many more greetings does he have?
00:26:40.240,00:26:42.030,师傅 您才进去一趟,,,
00:26:42.480,00:26:43.540,这衣服就湿透了,00:26:41.100,00:26:44.320,"Shifu, your clothes are soaking wet."
00:26:43.920,00:26:44.790,赶紧换一身吧,00:26:44.740,00:26:46.160,You should go get changed.
00:26:46.360,00:26:47.630,莞嫔没了孩子,00:26:47.380,00:26:48.840,"Since Concubine Sourire lost her child,"
00:26:47.960,00:26:49.950,皇上两天两夜没睡好了,00:26:48.960,00:26:50.440,His Majesty hasn't slept well - for two days now.
00:26:50.360,00:26:51.310,难免上火,00:26:50.740,00:26:52.620,"The situation has caused severe “internal fire."""
00:26:51.880,00:26:54.340,没事少在皇上面前晃悠 知道吗,00:26:52.900,00:26:55.280,"Don't walk around unnecessarily, understand?"
00:26:55.640,00:26:57.390,这差事当得我哟,00:26:56.440,00:26:58.200,What a day!
00:26:59.160,00:27:00.830,这眼看又是正午了,00:27:00.320,00:27:01.740,It's almost midday.
00:27:01.080,00:27:02.950,年妃娘娘又跪着了吧,00:27:02.100,00:27:04.040,Consort Nian must be kneeling at her gate.
00:27:42.920,00:27:43.870,走开,00:27:44.160,00:27:45.120,Go away.
00:27:45.480,00:27:46.190,娘娘,,,
00:27:46.560,00:27:48.310,您都已经在这儿跪了三天了,00:27:46.520,00:27:47.580,"Your Highness,"
00:27:48.600,00:27:49.910,昨天还中了暑气,00:27:47.660,00:27:49.420,you have been kneeling here for three days.
00:27:50.520,00:27:51.910,娘娘身子要紧啊,00:27:49.580,00:27:51.120,You had sunstroke yesterday.
,,,00:27:51.520,00:27:53.000,Your Highness must care for your health.
00:27:52.880,00:27:54.270,本宫若不如此,00:27:53.780,00:27:55.240,"If I don't kneel here,"
00:27:55.400,00:27:57.150,皇上便不会消气,00:27:56.140,00:27:57.980,His Majesty will still be angry.
00:27:58.560,00:28:00.150,皇上若不消气,00:27:59.680,00:28:01.280,"If His Majesty is angry,"
00:28:01.520,00:28:03.510,必然就不会原谅本宫,00:28:02.160,00:28:04.160,he will not forgive me.
00:28:06.160,00:28:07.110,你走,00:28:07.440,00:28:08.400,Go.
00:28:08.680,00:28:09.870,你走啊,00:28:09.800,00:28:11.320,I said go!
00:28:21.920,00:28:23.630,娘娘 娘娘,00:28:22.160,00:28:23.400,Your Highness!
00:28:23.880,00:28:24.910,娘娘 你醒醒啊,00:28:23.620,00:28:26.020,Your Highness! Are you all right?
00:28:25.280,00:28:25.990,来人哪,00:28:26.200,00:28:27.280,Help!
00:28:29.800,00:28:32.470,皇上 十七爷过来给您请安了,00:28:30.840,00:28:33.460,"Your Majesty, Lord XVII is here to pay his respects."
00:28:32.640,00:28:33.110,让他进来吧,,,
00:28:33.400,00:28:34.030,嗻,00:28:33.500,00:28:34.480,Send him in.
,,,00:28:34.480,00:28:35.900,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:28:44.560,00:28:45.230,皇上,,,
00:28:46.560,00:28:47.670,臣弟特来请罪,00:28:45.540,00:28:46.700,"Your Majesty,"
00:28:49.520,00:28:50.270,起来吧,00:28:47.600,00:28:49.500,I am here to seek your punishment.
00:28:51.440,00:28:52.070,坐,00:28:50.680,00:28:51.920,You may rise.
,,,00:28:52.580,00:28:53.620,Have a seat.
00:28:59.400,00:29:00.510,你这是怎么了,00:29:00.320,00:29:02.560,What’s the matter?
00:29:02.120,00:29:04.230,臣弟那日偶闻翊坤宫出事,00:29:03.080,00:29:05.780,"When I heard about what was happening
at the Palace of Earthly Honor,"
00:29:04.960,00:29:06.670,不得已闯宫 惊扰了嫔妃,00:29:05.920,00:29:08.360,I had no better choice than entering Your Majesty's harem.
00:29:08.080,00:29:09.220,还请皇兄降罪,00:29:09.060,00:29:11.320,I deserve Your Majesty’s punishment.
00:29:11.440,00:29:12.830,你已说了不得已,00:29:12.220,00:29:14.100,You've said that was the only possible choice.
00:29:13.320,00:29:14.430,朕又怎么会怪你,00:29:14.320,00:29:15.740,How can I blame you?
00:29:15.560,00:29:17.860,皇兄珍爱莞嫔 尽人皆知,00:29:16.600,00:29:19.140,It's known to all that Your Majesty cherishes Consort Sourire.
00:29:18.400,00:29:20.910,前不久又刚失去富察贵人之子,00:29:19.300,00:29:21.920,And Lady Fuca's miscarriage was so recent.
00:29:21.560,00:29:23.710,臣弟是不忍皇兄再失去莞嫔之子,,,
00:29:24.160,00:29:25.030,再度伤怀啊,00:29:22.500,00:29:25.760,I couldn't bear to see the loss of another child of Your Majesty's.
00:29:25.880,00:29:27.230,你已尽人事,00:29:26.980,00:29:28.840,You did all you could.
00:29:28.040,00:29:28.950,天命不许,00:29:29.060,00:29:30.720,It is Heaven that disapproves.
00:29:30.200,00:29:32.030,朕与你都没有办法,00:29:31.320,00:29:33.440,We can do nothing about that.
00:29:33.360,00:29:34.750,皇兄还是稍微歇歇吧,00:29:34.400,00:29:35.520,Your Majesty should have more rest.
00:29:35.320,00:29:37.620,后宫的事已经够让你心烦了,00:29:35.920,00:29:38.880,"Your countenance has been disturbed
by events in the harem."
00:29:38.200,00:29:39.990,再看折子伤了身子便不好,00:29:39.180,00:29:41.780,Reviewing the memorandums now is not good for your health.
00:29:41.480,00:29:43.750,这个是年羹尧的请安折子,00:29:42.500,00:29:44.880,This is the greeting from Nian Gengyao.
00:29:44.200,00:29:44.910,你先瞅瞅,00:29:45.180,00:29:46.580,Have a look.
00:29:50.320,00:29:52.190,年大将军不仅关心国事,,,
00:29:53.480,00:29:54.910,更关心皇兄的家事啊,00:29:51.360,00:29:56.120,"General Nian cares more about
Your
Majesty’s family affairs than state affairs."
00:29:55.880,00:29:57.270,他若是朕的亲戚,00:29:56.900,00:29:58.520,"Since he is my family,"
00:29:59.120,00:30:00.070,懂得分寸,,,
00:30:01.320,00:30:03.950,关心朕的家事也无可厚非,00:30:00.180,00:30:04.660,he can ask about my family affairs within bounds of propriety.
00:30:04.520,00:30:05.580,他若是臣子,00:30:05.520,00:30:07.140,"But as a courtier,"
00:30:06.280,00:30:10.230,那指手画脚就是藐视君上,00:30:07.260,00:30:11.680,"he is throwing his weight around,
holding me in contempt."
00:30:14.800,00:30:15.910,皇兄和年大将军,,,
00:30:16.720,00:30:19.350,自然是先论君臣 再论姻亲,00:30:15.880,00:30:20.280,"Your Majesty and General Nian are monarch and
 subject before relatives through marriage."
00:30:19.840,00:30:21.550,只可惜他不懂得这个道理,00:30:20.680,00:30:22.780,It’s a pity that he doesn’t understand.
00:30:22.760,00:30:23.900,年妃犯错,00:30:23.760,00:30:25.560,"While Consort Nian is punished,"
00:30:24.760,00:30:28.270,年羹尧封封奏折都问及年妃安好,00:30:25.880,00:30:29.140,Nian Gengyao sends his greetings to her in every message.
00:30:28.920,00:30:29.870,岂非存心,,,
00:30:30.840,00:30:32.150,若是在皇兄面前不懂,00:30:29.860,00:30:31.360,His meaning is clear.
00:30:32.440,00:30:34.430,便是失礼于君 无礼于君上,00:30:31.920,00:30:35.380,"If he behaves like this to Your Majesty, that is
disrespectful to his master and monarch."
00:30:34.960,00:30:36.350,若是在天下人面前不懂,,,
00:30:36.720,00:30:37.700,便是失礼于天下人,,,
00:30:38.240,00:30:39.750,同顾皇兄对他的恩宠,00:30:35.900,00:30:40.840,"If he behaves like this to the people,
he is abusing Your Majesty's trust and favor."
00:30:42.600,00:30:44.750,你很少论及朝政,00:30:43.680,00:30:45.840,You rarely pass comment on state affairs.
00:30:46.520,00:30:49.870,臣弟是皇兄的亲弟弟,00:30:47.660,00:30:50.580,I am ... your brother.
00:30:50.560,00:30:51.750,只是在谈论家事,00:30:51.420,00:30:53.080,I only talk about family affairs.
00:30:54.360,00:30:57.030,启禀皇上 翊坤宫来人回话,,,
00:30:57.320,00:30:59.230,说年妃娘娘疲累过度,00:30:55.400,00:31:01.260,"Your Majesty, the Palace of Earthly Honor reports
that Consort Nian fainted from heatstroke."
00:30:59.640,00:31:00.670,中暑晕过去了,,,
00:31:01.000,00:31:01.710,太医去了吗,,,
00:31:02.040,00:31:02.790,正在看呢,00:31:01.880,00:31:03.040,Did the doctors visit?
00:31:04.120,00:31:05.430,那你就告诉年妃,00:31:03.040,00:31:04.340,They are in attendance.
00:31:06.280,00:31:07.950,在身体康复之前,00:31:05.060,00:31:10.600,"Tell Consort Nian that she is exempt from
her daily kneeling until she recovers."
00:31:08.280,00:31:09.630,先免了她每日的跪罚,,,
00:31:10.080,00:31:10.750,嗻,00:31:11.180,00:31:12.100,Aye.
00:31:12.280,00:31:13.710,皇兄毕竟是念旧之人,00:31:13.160,00:31:14.600,Your Majesty is caring.
00:31:14.320,00:31:15.670,纵然年妃犯下大错,,,
00:31:16.400,00:31:18.270,皇兄还是念及旧日的恩情,00:31:15.320,00:31:19.140,You feel sentimental about the past despite her grave mistake.
00:31:18.960,00:31:21.950,世兰侍奉朕多年 也算尽心,00:31:20.000,00:31:23.260,Nian Shilan has been very conscientious over the years.
00:31:22.840,00:31:25.990,朕过于严惩 只怕会伤了她的心,00:31:23.980,00:31:27.080,I don't want to destroy her spirit from overly stern punishment.
00:31:26.840,00:31:29.950,年妃和年大将军兄妹情深,00:31:27.840,00:31:31.100,She and her brother are very caring for one another.
00:31:31.160,00:31:31.830,伤了年妃,,,
00:31:32.160,00:31:33.510,也是伤了年大将军的心嘛,00:31:32.020,00:31:34.860,Dispiriting one would dishearten the other.
00:31:34.440,00:31:36.110,年羹尧的请安折子上,,,
00:31:36.480,00:31:37.350,不都明说了吗,00:31:35.520,00:31:38.260,Nian Gengyao has made that very clear.
00:31:38.680,00:31:42.350,年妃贬斥 臣心内不安,00:31:39.700,00:31:43.400,"""I am deeply disturbed by Consort Nian's demotion."""
00:31:43.200,00:31:45.230,如置数九冰雪之中,,,
00:31:45.800,00:31:48.670,连日来五内茫然 不知所以,00:31:44.320,00:31:49.240,"""As if my heart was in the chill of the winter
and my five viscera in the haze of a fog."""
00:31:49.920,00:31:51.910,他这样寒心 不知所以,00:31:50.940,00:31:52.900,He is disappointed and devastated.
00:31:52.280,00:31:53.150,竟是不顾自己,,,
00:31:53.520,00:31:55.670,说什么话 做什么事了,00:31:52.940,00:31:56.100,He's not thinking through what he says and does.
00:31:56.400,00:31:57.990,年妃伤及皇兄的龙裔,00:31:57.220,00:31:59.280,Consort Nian harmed an imperial heir
00:31:58.880,00:32:00.100,本是罪无可恕,00:31:59.780,00:32:01.380,and her offense is unpardonable.
00:32:02.320,00:32:04.230,牵一发而动全身哪,00:32:03.140,00:32:05.920,It’s like “pulling a single hair affects the whole body”.
00:32:05.800,00:32:07.150,不重罚年妃,,,
00:32:07.800,00:32:09.020,后宫风纪不正,00:32:06.920,00:32:10.060,A lenient punishment on her won't restore discipline in the harem
00:32:10.080,00:32:11.590,莞嫔心内不安,00:32:11.140,00:32:13.100,and assuage Concubine Sourire's grief.
00:32:12.640,00:32:14.030,若重责年妃,00:32:13.720,00:32:15.100,But a severe punishment ...
00:32:14.320,00:32:16.830,朕与她多年的恩情实难不顾,00:32:15.160,00:32:17.660,She has been in favor all these years ...
00:32:17.240,00:32:18.030,就算,00:32:18.260,00:32:19.520,Even if ...
00:32:19.080,00:32:20.990,朕能舍得下这份私情,00:32:20.120,00:32:22.600,"Even if I wasn't sentimental about the past,"
00:32:21.960,00:32:23.950,难道能不顾朝中局面,00:32:22.960,00:32:25.620,I have to take the many powers in the court into account.
00:32:27.040,00:32:28.150,若换你是朕,,,
00:32:29.440,00:32:30.270,你会怎么做,00:32:28.140,00:32:30.980,What would you do if you were me?
00:32:34.280,00:32:36.580,圣人云 不在其位不谋其政,00:32:35.180,00:32:38.100,"“Those who are not in office should not
concern themselves with the job.” [Confucius]"
00:32:37.360,00:32:39.030,臣弟心软 又担不起大事,00:32:38.320,00:32:40.520,I’m an indecisive and incapable person when it comes to serious matters.
00:32:39.920,00:32:41.950,这美人落泪 便是一个也舍不得,00:32:40.760,00:32:43.020,I would be distressed seeing the tears of beautiful women.
00:32:42.280,00:32:43.590,若是再掺上这些大事,,,
00:32:44.440,00:32:45.630,那真是一锅糨糊了,00:32:43.260,00:32:46.700,"Combined with state affairs, it will ""turn my head into wheat paste""."
00:32:46.400,00:32:48.270,你便一味躲懒吧,00:32:47.320,00:32:49.600,You've always shirked your duties at the court.
00:32:49.240,00:32:51.110,如今便是你要躲懒,,,
00:32:51.480,00:32:52.510,朕也容不下你了,00:32:50.180,00:32:53.460,But now I can't allow you to keep doing that.
00:32:53.600,00:32:57.300,有些事 你得助朕一臂之力,00:32:54.800,00:32:58.440,"With some things, you must lend me a hand."
00:32:57.840,00:33:00.750,臣弟虽然糊涂 但是谨记一条,00:32:58.820,00:33:01.780,"I am a witless man, but there's one thing I understand —"
00:33:01.440,00:33:03.110,皇兄说什么便是什么,00:33:02.400,00:33:04.620,Do what Your Majesty says.
00:33:04.920,00:33:06.190,唯君命是从,00:33:05.860,00:33:07.720,I will  obey Your Majesty's orders.
00:33:15.560,00:33:17.590,娘娘 娘娘,00:33:16.440,00:33:18.700,Your Highness. Your Highness.
00:33:20.000,00:33:21.670,娘娘 你醒了 皇上,00:33:20.780,00:33:22.940,"- Your Highness is awake.
- Your Majesty."
00:33:23.200,00:33:24.230,皇上来了吗,00:33:24.080,00:33:25.800,Did His Majesty come?
00:33:26.280,00:33:27.630,娘娘中暑受热,,,
00:33:28.040,00:33:28.870,太医嘱咐,00:33:27.180,00:33:29.000,Your Highness had a heatstroke.
00:33:29.160,00:33:31.110,即便是醒了也不宜再辛苦,00:33:29.140,00:33:32.000,"The imperial doctor advised Your Highness
not to exert yourself again."
00:33:31.440,00:33:32.470,娘娘还是躺下吧,00:33:32.000,00:33:33.620,Your Highness should lie down.
00:33:33.400,00:33:37.630,告诉皇上本宫中暑晕倒了吗,00:33:34.420,00:33:38.460,Has His Majesty been informed that I fainted from a heatstroke?
00:33:39.600,00:33:40.790,奴婢已经打发好几拨人,,,
00:33:41.200,00:33:42.230,去禀告皇上了,00:33:40.380,00:33:43.200,"I have sent quite a few groups of servants
to report to His Majesty ..."
00:33:42.600,00:33:43.390,可是,00:33:43.540,00:33:44.640,But ...
00:33:53.760,00:33:54.550,娘娘,00:33:54.720,00:33:56.140,Your Highness.
00:34:11.600,00:34:12.510,小主醒了,00:34:12.320,00:34:14.020,"You woke up, My Lady."
00:34:17.960,00:34:19.150,小主身子还虚,00:34:18.740,00:34:20.400,"My Lady, you are still recovering."
00:34:19.640,00:34:21.310,这样坐着仔细腰疼啊,00:34:20.400,00:34:22.420,Sitting like this might cause you back pain.
00:34:24.560,00:34:26.470,我现在哪怕痛彻心扉,00:34:25.580,00:34:27.660,"No matter how much pain I have now,"
00:34:28.200,00:34:30.350,我都觉得是我应该承受的,00:34:29.260,00:34:31.220,I feel like I deserve it.
00:34:32.520,00:34:33.950,我每日都在痛悔,00:34:33.400,00:34:35.640,I have been regretting every day ...
00:34:35.560,00:34:37.030,那日我在年妃宫中,,,
00:34:38.600,00:34:40.510,为何不能向她屈膝求饶,00:34:36.540,00:34:41.660,Why didn't I beg for Consort Nian's forgiveness that day?
00:34:41.240,00:34:43.590,我为何要如此强硬 不肯服输,00:34:42.260,00:34:45.120,"Why was I so stubborn, not bowing down my head?"
00:34:45.600,00:34:46.660,我若肯求她,00:34:46.480,00:34:48.380,"If only I had begged,"
00:34:48.400,00:34:50.350,我或许还能保住我的孩子,00:34:49.220,00:34:51.760,I might have been able to save my child.
00:34:57.960,00:34:59.150,小主多虑了,00:34:58.920,00:35:00.580,"It's not your fault, My Lady."
00:35:00.680,00:35:02.550,就算是小主当时肯低头,00:35:01.480,00:35:03.580,"Even if you were willing to give in,"
00:35:03.080,00:35:05.750,那年妃也未必会轻易放过你呀,00:35:04.040,00:35:06.920,Consort Nian still would not have let you off easily.
00:35:06.840,00:35:08.110,我为何要得宠,00:35:07.760,00:35:09.980,Why did I want to gain His Majesty's favor?
00:35:10.480,00:35:11.870,我若是默默无闻,00:35:11.280,00:35:13.100,"If I had lived in obscurity,"
00:35:13.160,00:35:14.750,年妃就不会嫉恨我,00:35:14.060,00:35:16.120,"Consort Nian wouldn’t have been jealously resenting me,"
00:35:15.880,00:35:17.270,不会置我于死地,00:35:16.520,00:35:19.020,fighting me with such deadly force.
00:35:19.760,00:35:22.350,年妃纵然千刀万剐不足泄恨,00:35:20.740,00:35:23.500,"My hate won't subside even if she receives
""death by a thousand cuts""."
00:35:24.280,00:35:25.190,可是我呢,00:35:25.160,00:35:26.620,But what about me?
00:35:26.720,00:35:28.470,我何尝不是大错特错,00:35:27.540,00:35:29.740,I'm the one who made the stupidest mistake.
00:35:29.480,00:35:30.230,小主,00:35:30.540,00:35:31.940,"My Lady,"
00:35:32.520,00:35:33.950,小主不要多想了,00:35:33.160,00:35:35.160,please don’t continue blaming yourself.
00:35:34.720,00:35:37.510,凡事只能往前看 不能回头,00:35:35.860,00:35:38.640,You can only look forward. There's no turning back.
00:35:38.880,00:35:40.470,小主又何曾想过,,,
00:35:40.840,00:35:42.060,会有今日这祸事呢,00:35:39.760,00:35:43.520,You could never have foreseen that day's misfortune.
00:35:43.040,00:35:46.310,此番的事真的不是小主的过错,00:35:44.140,00:35:47.180,You are not at fault.
00:35:50.480,00:35:51.620,原这肚兜,00:35:51.360,00:35:52.800,This bib ...
00:35:54.160,00:35:56.990,我是欢欢喜喜绣给我孩儿穿的,00:35:54.980,00:35:58.520,I was so happy making it for my baby.
00:35:59.920,00:36:01.510,可如今肚兜还在,00:36:01.140,00:36:03.140,"The bib is still here,"
00:36:03.440,00:36:04.660,可我的孩子,00:36:04.440,00:36:06.380,but my child
00:36:06.040,00:36:08.790,却再不能来到这世间了,00:36:07.100,00:36:09.780,will never enter this world.
00:36:15.400,00:36:16.070,皇上万安,00:36:16.280,00:36:18.100,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:36:18.880,00:36:19.550,起来吧,,,
00:36:21.000,00:36:21.710,莞嫔呢,00:36:19.780,00:36:21.020,Rise.
00:36:22.200,00:36:23.180,小主昨夜没睡好,00:36:22.040,00:36:23.040,How's Concubine Sourire?
00:36:23.520,00:36:24.500,现下正在里头睡着呢,00:36:23.200,00:36:24.280,My Lady didn’t sleep well last night.
,,,00:36:24.340,00:36:25.800,She’s having a nap.
00:36:25.600,00:36:27.630,不用通报了 朕去瞧瞧她,00:36:26.400,00:36:28.700,"You don’t need to announce my arrival.
I’ll go in myself."
00:36:36.520,00:36:37.550,您这样哭下去,,,
00:36:38.160,00:36:39.870,对自己实在是无益,00:36:37.380,00:36:40.660,"It’s no good if you keep crying like this, My Lady."
00:36:41.240,00:36:42.110,这样哭下去,,,
00:36:42.440,00:36:43.550,就算将来身子好了,00:36:42.340,00:36:44.380,"If you keep crying so much,"
00:36:44.600,00:36:46.870,也会落下见风流泪的毛病的,00:36:45.660,00:36:48.140,you might have watery eyes when exposed to the wind in the future.
00:36:48.040,00:36:49.590,奴婢听宫里的老人说,00:36:48.980,00:36:50.980,The older servants in the palace said that
00:36:50.240,00:36:53.350,太后当年就是这样才落下病根的,00:36:51.080,00:36:54.060,"the Empress Dowager's chronic illness
 developed for the same reason."
00:36:54.400,00:36:55.870,太后福泽深厚,00:36:55.400,00:36:57.280,Her Majesty is deeply blessed.
00:36:57.880,00:36:59.430,又可是我能比的,00:36:59.080,00:37:00.760,I can’t compare with her.
00:37:02.040,00:37:03.310,小主这样哭泣,,,
00:37:04.320,00:37:05.870,万一皇上来了看见,00:37:03.160,00:37:06.880,"If His Majesty sees you like this, My Lady,"
00:37:06.320,00:37:08.310,又要勾起彼此的伤心事,00:37:07.120,00:37:09.540,it will bring so many painful memories to you both.
00:37:09.880,00:37:10.910,长此以往,,,
00:37:11.480,00:37:14.190,如果皇上不愿意再来碎玉轩了,00:37:11.040,00:37:14.960,"If His Majesty stops visiting the
Palace of Pearl Jade because of that,"
00:37:14.600,00:37:15.910,那岂不对小主不好,00:37:15.320,00:37:17.260,"it’s no good for you, My Lady."
00:37:17.560,00:37:20.950,我失去这孩子才不到十日,00:37:18.340,00:37:24.340,Ten days haven't even passed since I lost my child.
00:37:23.480,00:37:25.150,难道我这个做母亲的,,,
00:37:26.080,00:37:27.390,就能涂脂抹粉,,,
00:37:28.360,00:37:30.470,穿红戴绿地去强颜欢笑吗,00:37:24.400,00:37:31.500,"How could I, as a mother, forget my grief, and dress myself up to please others?"
00:37:32.040,00:37:33.630,奴婢不是这个意思,00:37:33.000,00:37:34.900,"You needn't please anyone, My Lady."
00:37:34.480,00:37:35.590,奴婢的意思是说,,,
00:37:36.640,00:37:37.780,小主还年轻,00:37:35.600,00:37:38.700,You are in your prime age.
00:37:40.040,00:37:41.670,只要皇上还疼爱小主,,,
00:37:42.080,00:37:43.590,不怕将来没有孩子,00:37:40.600,00:37:45.500,You can conceive babies in the future as long as you have His Majesty's favor.
00:37:45.840,00:37:48.190,小主万万不能这样苦了自己,00:37:46.800,00:37:49.100,"You shouldn't give in to grief like this, my lady."
00:37:49.160,00:37:50.510,并不是我要自苦,00:37:50.100,00:37:51.700,I don't mean to.
00:37:52.800,00:37:54.310,只是我一见到皇上,00:37:53.800,00:37:55.300,"But once I see His Majesty,"
00:37:56.280,00:37:57.910,就难免想到此事,00:37:57.200,00:37:58.900,I can't help but think of my child.
00:37:59.640,00:38:01.310,我实在是笑不出来,00:38:00.600,00:38:02.300,I can't even force a smile.
00:38:06.520,00:38:08.750,刚才晚膳时 你食不知味,00:38:07.500,00:38:09.700,You were absent-minded at the dinner table.
00:38:10.720,00:38:12.750,你看你最近心力交瘁,00:38:11.700,00:38:13.700,"Recently, you seem to be exhausted."
00:38:13.240,00:38:14.630,哀家实在担心,00:38:14.200,00:38:15.600,I am worried about you.
00:38:15.320,00:38:16.110,孩儿无妨,00:38:16.300,00:38:17.100,I'm all right.
00:38:16.400,00:38:19.110,哀家让太医开了些安神降火的药,00:38:17.400,00:38:20.300,The doctor has prepared some medicine to lessen the internal heat.
00:38:19.840,00:38:22.110,待会儿让苏培盛服侍你吃了,00:38:20.800,00:38:23.100,Su Peisheng will serve it to you later.
00:38:22.440,00:38:23.190,早点睡吧,00:38:23.240,00:38:24.140,Go to bed early.
00:38:23.600,00:38:26.270,太医开的又是那些苦药,00:38:24.600,00:38:27.200,Imperial doctors' medicines are always bitter.
00:38:27.000,00:38:28.870,嫌儿子心里还不够苦吗,00:38:28.000,00:38:30.300,They will only add more bitterness to my heart.
00:38:35.080,00:38:37.310,儿子心情不好 皇额娘别见怪,00:38:36.000,00:38:38.300,"I apologize for my bad mood, Imperial Mother."
00:38:39.760,00:38:41.590,哀家知道你心里苦,00:38:40.700,00:38:42.500,"I know you are deeply upset,"
00:38:42.640,00:38:44.470,富察贵人和莞嫔的孩子,,,
00:38:44.800,00:38:46.470,一个接一个地都没了,00:38:43.600,00:38:47.400,as Lady Fuca and Concubine Sourire both lost their children.
00:38:47.440,00:38:50.150,这些日子 你都不肯进后宫,00:38:48.400,00:38:51.100,"These days, you hardly come to the harem."
00:38:51.720,00:38:52.510,皇额娘,00:38:52.700,00:38:53.800,"Imperial Mother,"
00:38:53.960,00:38:56.070,儿子心里一直有一个疑问,00:38:54.900,00:38:57.000,There is always a doubt in my mind.
00:38:58.040,00:39:00.150,年妃气盛好强不假,,,
00:39:01.800,00:39:04.100,不喜欢莞嫔也是真,00:38:59.000,00:39:05.100,"Even though Consort Nian is overbearing, and she dislikes Concubine Sourire,"
00:39:05.280,00:39:06.990,但是莞嫔在翊坤宫,,,
00:39:07.320,00:39:09.590,跪了半个时辰孩子便没了,00:39:06.200,00:39:09.300,it still doesn't make any sense that Concubine Sourire lost her child
00:39:10.440,00:39:11.580,的确令人意外,00:39:09.500,00:39:12.700,after she knelt down for only one hour in the Palace of Earthly Honor.
00:39:14.120,00:39:15.230,皇帝所言,00:39:15.260,00:39:16.560,I have the same doubt.
00:39:15.760,00:39:17.950,哀家也派人细细查问过,00:39:16.700,00:39:18.900,And I have ordered them to investigate it.
00:39:18.920,00:39:21.630,年妃掌权后极重威势,00:39:19.900,00:39:23.200,"Once Consort Nian held power, she emphasized
 her status over the other concubines."
00:39:22.560,00:39:25.510,每日宣各嫔妃至翊坤宫闲话,00:39:23.500,00:39:26.500,"Every day, she summoned the concubines to her palace."
00:39:26.480,00:39:28.780,不至三四个时辰绝不散去,00:39:27.400,00:39:30.700,"They were seldom allowed to leave until
staying there for six to eight hours."
00:39:30.040,00:39:32.070,莞嫔与年妃素有心结,00:39:31.200,00:39:33.300,Concubine Sourire had disliked Consort Nian for long.
00:39:32.720,00:39:33.990,难免郁闷伤身,,,
00:39:34.320,00:39:35.150,何至于此,00:39:33.520,00:39:35.200,Inevitaby her strong emotions would have damaged her health.
,,,00:39:35.240,00:39:36.940,It wouldn't cause such a serious result.
00:39:37.240,00:39:40.710,年妃宫里长年累月点着,00:39:38.200,00:39:42.780,The Palace of Earthly Honor has long been burning ...
00:39:42.320,00:39:43.380,皇额娘别说了,00:39:43.300,00:39:45.220,"Mother, you don't need to say more."
00:39:46.720,00:39:47.860,都是儿子的错,00:39:47.700,00:39:48.800,It's all my fault.
00:39:50.160,00:39:51.190,国事为重,,,
00:39:52.120,00:39:53.510,皇帝从来没有错,00:39:50.940,00:39:53.260,It's not. You prioritize national interests over all else.
,,,00:39:53.260,00:39:55.420,You did nothing wrong.
00:39:55.280,00:39:56.830,不过哀家也觉得,00:39:56.200,00:39:57.800,"Also, in my opinion,"
00:39:58.040,00:40:01.430,这个东西每日所用的分量不重,00:39:58.900,00:40:02.720,the daily consumption of the incense is small
00:40:02.160,00:40:04.350,需要日积月累才能见效,00:40:03.200,00:40:05.920,and it is only effective after being used for a long time.
00:40:05.240,00:40:07.830,所以平日嫔妃们至翊坤宫,00:40:06.420,00:40:09.060,That's why you and I were never concerned
00:40:08.920,00:40:11.150,哀家和皇帝从不在意,00:40:09.920,00:40:12.200,over concubines visiting the Palace of Earthly Honor.
00:40:13.000,00:40:14.270,至于莞嫔,00:40:14.040,00:40:15.900,"As for Concubine Sourire,"
00:40:15.200,00:40:17.550,也就是那几日才多待了会儿,00:40:16.260,00:40:19.240,"she was never in the Palace of
Earthly Honor except in those few days."
00:40:19.000,00:40:20.350,你再仔细想想,00:40:20.060,00:40:21.720,Think carefully.
00:40:21.520,00:40:24.310,除了这条 还有没有别的,00:40:22.500,00:40:25.300,Can there be other reasons besides this?
00:40:25.560,00:40:28.070,莞嫔初得宠时,00:40:26.500,00:40:29.000,"When I began to favor Concubine Sourire,"
00:40:29.600,00:40:32.510,余氏曾经在她的药中下毒,00:40:30.400,00:40:33.500,Escort Yu put poison into her medicine.
00:40:33.880,00:40:35.790,过了好些日子才察觉,00:40:34.400,00:40:37.400,The poisoning went on for quite a few days before being discovered.
00:40:37.160,00:40:38.380,那就是了,00:40:38.200,00:40:39.700,That's the reason.
00:40:39.520,00:40:41.350,莞嫔本就中过毒,00:40:40.400,00:40:42.600,Concubine Sourire had previously been poisoned.
00:40:42.200,00:40:44.760,或许体弱 难以保胎,00:40:43.000,00:40:45.900,"Possibly, her physical state was too weakened to prevent the miscarriage."
00:40:45.560,00:40:48.120,所以你就更加无需自责了,00:40:46.500,00:40:49.100,"In this case, you should not blame yourself anymore."
00:40:56.840,00:40:58.390,皇上 章弥章太医,,,
00:40:58.720,00:40:59.700,一直在这儿候着皇上,00:40:57.800,00:41:00.900,"Your Majesty, Doctor Zhang has been waiting for you for a long time."
00:41:00.080,00:41:00.750,让他过来吧,,,
00:41:01.000,00:41:01.710,是,00:41:01.000,00:41:01.700,Call him here.
,,,00:41:02.000,00:41:02.700,Yes.
00:41:04.360,00:41:06.350,罪臣章弥叩见皇上,00:41:05.300,00:41:07.660,The culpable official Zhang Mi bows before Your Majesty.
00:41:07.000,00:41:09.990,这么晚过来 可是莞嫔有事吗,00:41:07.660,00:41:10.900,"It's late for you to ask to see me. Is there
anything wrong with Concubine Sourire?"
00:41:10.320,00:41:11.230,莞嫔无恙,00:41:11.000,00:41:12.300,Concubine Sourire is well.
00:41:11.480,00:41:14.230,微臣此来是特向皇上请罪的,00:41:12.400,00:41:15.200,I am here to ask for Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:41:15.080,00:41:17.910,微臣已年过六十 实在是老朽,00:41:16.000,00:41:18.900,I am over sixty years.
00:41:18.280,00:41:19.750,不能秉承皇上圣意,,,
00:41:20.160,00:41:21.830,保全莞嫔龙胎,00:41:19.200,00:41:22.800,I was too old to follow Your Majesty's order to protect Concubine Sourire's child.
00:41:22.160,00:41:23.710,实在是失职,00:41:23.100,00:41:24.700,I failed to accomplish my duty.
00:41:24.000,00:41:26.030,你侍奉莞嫔尽心尽力,00:41:25.000,00:41:27.300,You did your utmost to serve Concubine Sourire.
00:41:26.640,00:41:29.670,这次的事也不能算是你的错,00:41:27.600,00:41:30.700,"This time, it's not your fault."
00:41:30.160,00:41:31.380,莞嫔龙胎不保,00:41:31.100,00:41:32.300,Concubine Sourire lost her child.
00:41:31.920,00:41:34.350,微臣是伤心惶恐,00:41:32.800,00:41:35.300,I am deeply saddened by the loss of an imperial heir.
00:41:34.720,00:41:36.310,日夜寝食不安,00:41:35.600,00:41:37.400,"I haven't been able to eat, or sleep well."
00:41:36.760,00:41:40.030,实在不能在宫中担此差事,00:41:37.700,00:41:41.000,I no longer deserve to serve as an imperial doctor.
00:41:41.560,00:41:42.670,你的医术不差,00:41:42.500,00:41:43.900,You are an experienced doctor
00:41:43.600,00:41:46.630,入宫侍奉多年 也算是老臣了,00:41:44.600,00:41:47.600,and you have long served in the harem.
00:41:47.160,00:41:48.270,正因为如此,,,
00:41:48.880,00:41:51.180,微臣才万分地愧疚啊,00:41:48.100,00:41:52.100,That's why I feel so guilty.
00:41:51.880,00:41:54.510,作为医者不能保全其性命,,,
00:41:54.800,00:41:57.590,乃微臣毕生之憾哪,00:41:52.800,00:41:58.500,"As a doctor, failing to prevent the loss of life
will be the regret of all my life."
00:41:58.160,00:41:59.790,老朽实在无能啊,00:41:59.100,00:42:00.700,I'm incapable of fulfilling my duties.
00:42:00.680,00:42:04.670,如今太医院医术高明者层出不穷,00:42:01.600,00:42:05.600,"Now, the Imperial Infirmary is full of professional and talented doctors."
00:42:04.920,00:42:07.510,所以说 老臣打算离京,,,
00:42:07.880,00:42:09.310,告老还乡,00:42:05.900,00:42:10.300,"So, I intend to retire from my position and return to my hometown."
00:42:10.880,00:42:12.390,你若执意如此,00:42:11.800,00:42:13.300,"If you insist on it,"
00:42:13.480,00:42:14.830,朕也不能勉强你,00:42:14.400,00:42:15.800,I can't bend you to my will.
00:42:15.920,00:42:18.550,你便回乡安度晚年吧,00:42:16.900,00:42:19.500,I allow you to retire and return to your hometown.
