please offer incense."
00:03:44.680,00:03:46.590,大胆 谁鬼鬼祟祟躲在这里,00:03:45.680,00:03:48.137,How dare you! Hiding here sneakily!
00:03:52.810,00:03:55.430,贱妾参见皇后娘娘 各位小主,00:03:53.689,00:03:56.753,"This humble concubine bows in respect
before Your Majesty and My Ladies."
00:03:59.780,00:04:02.690,阿弥陀佛本宫还以为是谁,00:04:00.801,00:04:03.800,My precious Buddha! I thought it was somebody else.
00:04:03.240,00:04:04.600,原来是莞嫔娘娘,00:04:04.142,00:04:06.244,"I didn't expect it to be
Your Highness Concubine Sourire."
00:04:07.280,00:04:10.450,已经不是莞嫔 该如何称呼呢,00:04:08.000,00:04:10.262,"Oh, you are not Concubine Sourire anymore."
,,,00:04:10.262,00:04:11.848,What should I call you?
00:04:12.460,00:04:15.740,贱妾甘露寺莫愁,00:04:13.418,00:04:16.698,"This humble concubine is Mochou of
the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:04:16.460,00:04:17.700,莫愁是没错,00:04:17.419,00:04:18.952,Mochou is your name.
00:04:18.300,00:04:20.210,怎么自称贱妾 而非贫尼,00:04:19.298,00:04:21.902,"But why do you address yourself as
""humble concubine"" rather than ""humble nun""?"
00:04:20.880,00:04:23.040,难道是你自甘卑贱,00:04:21.902,00:04:24.200,Are you resigned to your lowly position
00:04:23.340,00:04:24.710,也不愿安守佛祖吗,00:04:24.261,00:04:26.193,but refusing to obey the Budhha?
00:04:26.140,00:04:27.920,莫愁娘子是带发修行,00:04:26.979,00:04:29.200,"Mistress Mochou is observing Buddhist
practice without her head shaved."
00:04:28.220,00:04:29.300,并非真正出家,00:04:29.300,00:04:30.986,She is not a real nun.
00:04:30.970,00:04:32.590,惠贵人关心情切,00:04:31.969,00:04:33.826,Lady Vertu is so concerned about Mochou.
00:04:32.890,00:04:34.880,到底还是对莫愁最好啊,00:04:33.826,00:04:36.216,You care about Mochou the most after all.
00:04:36.650,00:04:38.350,祺嫔妹妹也真是不小心,,,
00:04:39.190,00:04:41.100,方才踩到莫愁的手了,00:04:37.609,00:04:42.059,"It was careless of Concubine Délice
to step on Mochou's hand just now."
00:04:41.650,00:04:43.230,不知道要不要紧,00:04:42.409,00:04:44.669,I wonder if it needs urgent attention.
00:04:45.030,00:04:46.490,不要紧不要紧,00:04:45.869,00:04:47.507,"She's fine, she's fine."
00:04:46.820,00:04:49.060,莫愁啊现在干的都是粗活,00:04:48.018,00:04:50.258,Mochou does a lot of tough manual labor.
00:04:49.410,00:04:51.400,踩一下手不要紧的,00:04:50.369,00:04:52.480,"Stepping on her hands is
nothing to worry about."
00:04:52.000,00:04:52.780,粗活,00:04:53.016,00:04:54.345,Tough manual labor?
00:04:53.790,00:04:54.490,是啊,00:04:54.389,00:04:55.249,Yes.
00:04:55.420,00:04:58.500,毕竟不是养尊处优的娘娘小主,00:04:56.299,00:04:59.379,"After all, she is no longer an exalted concubine."
00:04:58.880,00:05:01.710,砍柴 浆洗 擦地都得做的,00:05:00.000,00:05:03.250,"She has to chop firewood, wash and
starch clothes, and clean the floor."
00:05:02.090,00:05:04.700,和寺里的小姑子没什么区别,00:05:03.250,00:05:05.760,She's no different than the new nuns here.
00:05:05.260,00:05:07.920,可莫愁毕竟是宫中的贵人,00:05:06.178,00:05:09.078,But Mochou is an esteemed person from the palace.
00:05:08.140,00:05:10.720,如此实在是委屈了,00:05:09.078,00:05:11.959,This must be hard for her.
00:05:11.600,00:05:12.710,那也是应该的,,,
00:05:13.310,00:05:15.010,一入空门 四大皆空,00:05:12.398,00:05:14.331,Her treatment here is only natural.
00:05:15.310,00:05:17.050,前程往事都该抛弃了,00:05:14.331,00:05:16.268,"Once you've entered the land of Buddhism,"
,,,00:05:16.268,00:05:18.847,"you must leave behind material
possessions and earthly cares."
00:05:17.850,00:05:19.810,佛法曰 众生平等,00:05:18.920,00:05:21.288,"Buddhism teaches us that every life
is created equal."
00:05:20.520,00:05:22.810,莫愁娘子也不该有例外,00:05:21.478,00:05:24.128,There shouldn't be an exception for Mochou.
00:05:23.440,00:05:24.430,娘娘说得是,00:05:24.128,00:05:25.518,"I agree, Your Majesty."
00:05:25.740,00:05:26.730,皇后娘娘,00:05:26.730,00:05:27.840,"Your Majesty,"
00:05:27.410,00:05:30.150,莫愁到底是奉旨出宫修行的,00:05:28.589,00:05:31.304,"Mochou practices Buddhism here
on His Majesty's orders."
00:05:30.700,00:05:32.070,又是公主的生母,00:05:31.748,00:05:34.014,"Moreover, she is the mother of a princess."
00:05:32.870,00:05:35.660,您看她的脸色就知道她身子虚弱,00:05:34.014,00:05:37.337,"Just looking at her pale face,
you can see how frail she is."
00:05:36.410,00:05:37.490,可寺里,,,
00:05:37.750,00:05:40.120,还让她做这许多粗重的活计,00:05:37.825,00:05:41.353,"But the nuns are still making her do
all these onerous tasks."
00:05:40.500,00:05:41.330,岂不为难,,,
00:05:42.050,00:05:43.030,皇后娘娘说了,00:05:41.353,00:05:42.927,Isn't that being too harsh?
00:05:43.630,00:05:45.370,入了空门就该斩断前程,00:05:43.000,00:05:44.434,"As Her Majesty said,"
00:05:45.720,00:05:47.670,公主是公主 莫愁是莫愁,00:05:44.434,00:05:46.782,"the past is renounced upon stepping
 into the Gate of Emptiness."
00:05:48.430,00:05:49.420,皇上也说了,00:05:46.782,00:05:49.006,"The princess is the princess
and Mochou is Mochou."
00:05:49.800,00:05:51.540,公主只有敬妃一个额娘,00:05:49.494,00:05:51.044,"His Majesty also said,"
,,,00:05:51.044,00:05:53.103,Consort Estime is the only mother of the princess.
00:05:52.310,00:05:54.590,惠贵人别违背皇上的旨意才好,00:05:53.410,00:05:55.725,"You mustn't distort His Majesty's
edict, Lady Vertu."
00:06:01.440,00:06:03.770,娱儿地上凉你不要跪着了,00:06:02.399,00:06:04.800,"Huan'er, the floor is cold.
You don't need to kneel."
00:06:03.940,00:06:05.060,惠贵人你过来,,,
00:06:05.610,00:06:07.570,莫愁站的位置不该是你站的,00:06:04.819,00:06:06.658,"Lady Vertu, come back here."
00:06:08.740,00:06:10.190,快去吧 没事的,00:06:06.891,00:06:09.120,You shouldn't inhabit the space Mochou is in.
00:06:10.700,00:06:12.530,各人有各人站的地界,00:06:10.000,00:06:11.795,Go. I'm all right.
00:06:12.830,00:06:14.280,人鬼尚且不同途,00:06:11.795,00:06:13.987,Different people have their own place.
00:06:14.740,00:06:15.730,嫔妃和庶人,00:06:13.987,00:06:15.913,People and spirits cannot walk the same path.
00:06:16.120,00:06:17.580,又怎么可以站在一起呢,00:06:15.913,00:06:18.760,"Concubines and commoners
cannot stand side by side."
00:06:18.540,00:06:21.500,皇后娘娘 莫愁纵然离宫,00:06:19.494,00:06:22.738,"Your Majesty, although Mochou
has left the palace,"
00:06:22.090,00:06:24.580,也不该遭受身体和言语之辱,00:06:22.978,00:06:26.186,she doesn't deserve physical and verbal abuse.
00:06:25.960,00:06:28.050,佛家讲究心平气和,00:06:26.959,00:06:29.400,Buddhism emphasizes having a peaceful mind.
00:06:28.470,00:06:31.000,惠贵人 你今日失于急躁,00:06:29.489,00:06:32.239,"Lady Vertu, your impetuous behavior is improper."
00:06:31.300,00:06:33.170,不能再去参拜佛像了,00:06:32.379,00:06:34.293,You cannot worship the Buddha today.
00:06:33.510,00:06:36.180,你就跪在这儿好好静心思过吧,00:06:34.560,00:06:37.230,Kneel here and reflect on your actions.
00:06:39.140,00:06:40.730,后头是参拜的中殿了,00:06:40.140,00:06:42.150,The main prayer hall is in the back.
00:06:41.150,00:06:42.310,皇后娘娘这边请,00:06:42.150,00:06:43.576,"Your Majesty, this way, please."
00:06:42.810,00:06:44.300,各位小主 这边请,00:06:43.810,00:06:45.300,"My Ladies, please."
00:06:45.230,00:06:47.720,仔细脚下门槛高 仔细着,00:06:46.230,00:06:48.232,Mind the threshold when you exit.
,,,00:06:48.232,00:06:49.014,Please.
00:07:15.010,00:07:17.470,娘娘今日奔波劳碌也累了,00:07:16.010,00:07:18.470,Your Majesty must be tired after a long day.
00:07:17.770,00:07:19.100,不如早些歇息吧,,,
00:07:19.350,00:07:20.840,安嫔一向善察人意,00:07:18.770,00:07:20.000,Would you like to rest now?
00:07:21.270,00:07:22.680,难道看不出娘娘今日,00:07:20.000,00:07:22.009,Concubine An has perceptive eyes.
00:07:22.980,00:07:23.840,真的很高兴吗,00:07:22.270,00:07:25.178,Can't you see Her Majesty is truly pleased today?
00:07:24.810,00:07:27.150,本宫不是高兴 是欣慰,00:07:25.800,00:07:28.502,"I was not pleased, but reassured."
00:07:27.820,00:07:29.400,本宫欣慰在于,,,
00:07:29.820,00:07:32.360,甄嬛已经不存在任何威胁,00:07:28.820,00:07:33.360,"It's reassuring to know that Zhen Huan
will no longer be a threat."
00:07:33.320,00:07:34.810,要不是亲眼所见,00:07:34.320,00:07:36.160,"Had I not seen it myself,"
00:07:35.330,00:07:37.570,也不知道她过得像个蝼蚁,00:07:36.160,00:07:39.169,"I never would have known that she's
been living like a cockroach."
00:07:38.370,00:07:39.660,比起死去,,,
00:07:39.910,00:07:42.910,这些日子更能消磨她的心志,00:07:39.370,00:07:44.160,"A life like this will wear down
her resolve more than death."
00:07:43.750,00:07:46.160,所谓生不如死就是如此,00:07:44.830,00:07:47.920,"So this is what it means to
""live a life worse than death""."
00:07:46.800,00:07:48.410,臣妾今天离开甘露寺时,,,
00:07:48.800,00:07:49.910,已经盼咐静白师父了,00:07:47.920,00:07:49.800,"Today, when I left ‌the‌ ‌Temple‌ ‌of‌ ‌Pure‌ ‌Dew,"
00:07:50.260,00:07:51.210,不必善待甄嬛,00:07:49.800,00:07:52.680,"I told Prioress Jingbai not to treat
Zhen Huan with any generosity."
00:07:51.680,00:07:53.340,由得她自生自灭就是了,00:07:52.680,00:07:54.622,Just let her life take its course.
00:07:53.970,00:07:56.380,甄嬛已经不存在任何威胁了,00:07:54.970,00:07:57.380,"Although Zhen Huan is no threat to us,"
00:07:56.680,00:07:57.590,倒是皇上,,,
00:07:58.100,00:08:00.210,还没有完全可以放得下甄嬛,00:07:57.680,00:08:01.200,His Majesty hasn't completely gotten over her.
00:08:01.230,00:08:03.180,你们俩要加紧工夫,,,
00:08:03.730,00:08:05.090,好好讨皇上欢心,00:08:02.230,00:08:06.240,"You two should put more effort
into gaining His Majesty's favor."
00:08:05.610,00:08:06.890,是皇后娘娘,00:08:06.610,00:08:07.890,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:08:10.570,00:08:13.310,太后您觉得好些了吗,00:08:11.570,00:08:14.310,Does Your Majesty feel better now?
00:08:15.740,00:08:18.070,老毛病了 习惯了,00:08:16.740,00:08:19.425,"Don't worry, I'm used to being unwell at this age."
00:08:19.290,00:08:20.780,太后咳得这么厉害,,,
00:08:21.040,00:08:22.400,等下臣妾叫小厨房,00:08:20.290,00:08:22.002,Your Majesty has been coughing a lot.
00:08:22.620,00:08:25.360,给您炖上冰糖枇杷 好润润嗓子,00:08:22.002,00:08:26.884,"I will tell the kitchen to make some
sugared loquat soup to soothe your throat."
00:08:26.500,00:08:29.040,你今日身上的药油味怎么这么重,00:08:27.500,00:08:30.262,You smell strongly of medicinal oil today.
00:08:29.710,00:08:31.290,哀家闻着熏得慌,00:08:30.710,00:08:32.601,It's making me a little dizzy.
00:08:32.420,00:08:35.460,膝盖跪得疼 所以多抹了点,00:08:33.420,00:08:36.993,"I must have used too much on my knees.
They were aching badly from kneeling."
00:08:37.300,00:08:39.130,被罚跪就被罚跪了,00:08:38.300,00:08:40.441,That was a punishment.
00:08:40.350,00:08:42.380,皇后是要拿你做榜样,,,
00:08:42.980,00:08:45.180,才能压得住后宫其他人,00:08:41.350,00:08:46.160,"The Empress wanted to make an
example of you to others in the harem."
00:08:46.600,00:08:50.440,臣妾失言合该受罚可是莞嫔,00:08:47.600,00:08:50.730,I misspoke and deserved the punishment.
,,,00:08:50.730,00:08:51.840,But Concubine Sourire ...
00:08:53.070,00:08:55.030,莫愁她受尽苦楚,00:08:54.158,00:08:56.360,Mochou... has suffered immensely.
00:08:55.360,00:08:57.350,臣妾实在觉得很不安心,00:08:56.360,00:08:58.520,I cannot put my mind at peace.
00:08:57.700,00:08:59.560,你想说什么 自己说,00:08:58.700,00:09:00.915,What do you want to tell me? Be direct.
00:09:04.460,00:09:05.570,臣妾恳请太后,,,
00:09:05.920,00:09:07.830,顾念莫愁是胧月公主的生母,00:09:05.460,00:09:08.800,"I implore Your Majesty to shield
Mochou from endless hardship,"
00:09:08.170,00:09:09.370,请太后庇佑莫愁,,,
00:09:09.750,00:09:11.080,不要让她受尽苦楚,00:09:08.920,00:09:12.080,"on account of her being
Princess Longyue's birth mother."
00:09:13.840,00:09:15.920,你对莫愁便这么好吗,00:09:14.840,00:09:17.120,Why are you so faithful to Mochou?
00:09:17.010,00:09:19.880,是莫逆之交,00:09:18.010,00:09:19.470,We are...
00:09:24.270,00:09:25.680,哀家也听说了,00:09:19.692,00:09:21.680,friends of unwavering faith.
00:09:26.600,00:09:27.640,今日之事,00:09:25.270,00:09:28.640,I heard about what happened today.
00:09:28.230,00:09:31.100,是皇后与祺嫔有些失了分寸,00:09:29.230,00:09:32.100,"The Empress and Concubine Délice
were somewhat out of line."
00:09:31.820,00:09:33.310,但也不是要紧的事,00:09:32.500,00:09:34.354,But not seriously so.
00:09:33.570,00:09:35.270,臣妾只是可怜胧月公主,00:09:34.570,00:09:36.840,I can't help feeling sorry for Princess Longyue.
00:09:35.950,00:09:37.980,生下来就没了生母照顾,00:09:36.950,00:09:39.113,She was separated from her birth mother at birth.
00:09:38.530,00:09:41.650,若是莫愁在甘露寺受尽辛苦折磨,00:09:39.530,00:09:42.828,"If Mochou suffers torment
at the Temple of Pure Dew,"
00:09:42.200,00:09:43.990,那公主不是更可怜了,00:09:43.200,00:09:45.301,that would be even more reason to pity Princess Longyue.
00:09:48.210,00:09:51.330,凡事要留有余地也是应该的,00:09:49.210,00:09:52.809,It is right to not take things to extremes.
00:09:53.420,00:09:56.540,好了哀家派人去看看,00:09:54.420,00:09:57.540,All right. I will send someone to see her.
00:09:57.430,00:09:58.260,总不至于,,,
00:09:58.510,00:10:00.970,让莫愁受尽折磨而死就是了,00:09:58.430,00:10:01.960,"I can at least prevent Mochou
from being tortured to death."
00:10:01.640,00:10:02.380,谢太后,00:10:02.520,00:10:03.640,I thank Your Majesty.
00:10:02.640,00:10:05.130,有太后这句话 臣妾死而无怨了,00:10:03.640,00:10:06.308,"Hearing Your Majesty say so,
I could die now without regrets."
00:10:08.100,00:10:09.840,你别总是顾着别人,00:10:09.100,00:10:10.920,"You always care about others,"
00:10:10.310,00:10:11.720,也该顾顾自己,00:10:11.195,00:10:13.195,but what about yourself?
00:10:13.070,00:10:15.150,安嫔和祺嫔争宠,00:10:14.070,00:10:16.600,"Concubine An and Concubine Délice
are vying for the Emperor's favor."
00:10:16.030,00:10:19.570,这些日子你有多久没见皇帝了,00:10:17.030,00:10:20.570,"How long has it been
since you last saw the Emperor?"
00:10:20.280,00:10:24.190,皇上兴致所至 总会想起臣妾的,00:10:21.280,00:10:25.190,"His Majesty will summon me
when he is in the mood."
00:10:25.250,00:10:27.990,太后臣妾还有一个请求,00:10:26.250,00:10:29.212,"Your Majesty, I have another favor to ask of you."
00:10:28.750,00:10:30.450,既然碎玉轩现在空着,00:10:29.750,00:10:31.920,"Now that the Palace of Pearl Jade is unoccupied,"
00:10:30.920,00:10:32.910,不如把它赐给臣妾居住吧,00:10:31.920,00:10:33.910,I wonder if it could be granted to me.
00:10:34.750,00:10:36.370,你打算为莞嫔守着,,,
00:10:37.300,00:10:38.750,自从莞嫔离宫,00:10:35.750,00:10:38.081,"You intend to look after the palace
for Concubine Sourire?"
00:10:39.130,00:10:40.970,人人都说碎玉轩不吉利,00:10:38.300,00:10:40.130,"Since Concubine Sourire left the palace,"
,,,00:10:40.130,00:10:42.680,"everyone has been saying that the
Palace of Pearl Jade is inauspicious."
00:10:41.680,00:10:44.090,臣妾现在和敬妃住在一处,00:10:42.902,00:10:45.401,I have been living with Consort Estime.
00:10:44.640,00:10:46.880,虽说照顾胧月公主方便,00:10:45.640,00:10:48.640,"While that makes it convenient to
take care of Princess Longyue,"
00:10:47.520,00:10:49.800,可是总觉得地方不够宽敞,00:10:48.640,00:10:50.983,"I always feel that the palace
is not spacious enough."
00:10:50.400,00:10:51.560,臣妾想,00:10:51.400,00:10:52.826,I've been thinking…
00:10:52.020,00:10:54.180,与其等公主大了再挪腾地方,00:10:53.020,00:10:55.446,"Instead of moving elsewhere
when the princess is older,"
00:10:54.820,00:10:55.770,不如现在,,,
00:10:56.030,00:10:58.270,就让臣妾搬去碎玉轩居住吧,00:10:55.632,00:10:59.492,"why not allow me to move to
the Palace of Pearl Jade now?"
00:11:00.660,00:11:02.110,你可曾想清楚了,00:11:01.660,00:11:03.554,Have you thought about it carefully?
00:11:03.240,00:11:06.070,皇帝倘若对莞嫔还有心结,00:11:04.240,00:11:07.514,"If Concubine Sourire is still
an untied knot in the Emperor's heart,"
00:11:06.700,00:11:07.740,你一搬进去,00:11:07.700,00:11:09.051,"once you move in,"
00:11:08.330,00:11:10.070,就等于打入冷宫了,00:11:09.330,00:11:11.727,it will be just like living in the Cold Palace.
00:11:12.500,00:11:16.660,等皇上心结解开 一切都会好的,00:11:13.500,00:11:17.660,"Once his Majesty unties the knot,
everything will be fine."
00:11:17.300,00:11:18.250,那可不一定,00:11:18.300,00:11:20.178,That's by no means certain.
00:11:22.260,00:11:25.090,既然你喜欢就由着你吧,00:11:23.260,00:11:26.268,"But if you wish to, I will allow it."
00:11:27.680,00:11:28.550,谢太后,00:11:28.680,00:11:30.000,I thank Your Majesty.
00:11:33.940,00:11:34.680,阿晋,00:11:34.940,00:11:35.946,Ajin.
00:11:36.230,00:11:37.600,好久不见浣碧姑娘了,,,
00:11:37.900,00:11:39.140,甘露寺里的粗茶淡饭,00:11:37.230,00:11:38.689,"It's been a while, Jade."
00:11:39.610,00:11:40.820,姑娘却更见标致了,00:11:38.900,00:11:40.330,"Despite the poor fare in the temple,"
,,,00:11:40.330,00:11:41.820,you're looking prettier than ever!
00:11:41.150,00:11:42.820,越来越油嘴滑舌 惹人讨厌,00:11:41.820,00:11:43.712,And you're even more smarmy and annoying.
00:11:46.280,00:11:48.490,王爷原说胧月生辰前五日来,00:11:47.059,00:11:49.668,"Your Lordship said that you would come
five days before Longyue’s birthday."
00:11:48.830,00:11:50.240,却没具体说是什么时辰,,,
00:11:50.580,00:11:51.540,我只好早些来,00:11:49.830,00:11:51.373,But you didn't say exactly what time.
00:11:52.120,00:11:53.330,没想到王爷更早,00:11:51.580,00:11:52.629,So I came early.
,,,00:11:52.629,00:11:54.593,"I didn't expect that Your Lordship
would come even earlier."
00:11:55.000,00:11:57.740,我的私心哪 很想让我在此等待,00:11:56.000,00:11:58.740,I had my own reasons for wanting to wait here.
00:11:58.670,00:11:59.460,如果碰到了,,,
00:12:00.220,00:12:01.550,那就是一种格外的惊喜,00:11:59.572,00:12:02.560,"If we were to chance upon each other,
that would be a pleasant surprise indeed."
00:12:02.590,00:12:04.500,如果未曾约定时间就碰见,00:12:03.368,00:12:06.331,"If we were to come across one another
without prior arrangement,"
00:12:05.390,00:12:07.130,那就是缘分使然,00:12:06.331,00:12:08.509,wouldn't that be an arrangement of fate?
00:12:10.980,00:12:13.890,说实话男女情分上,00:12:11.980,00:12:14.890,"To be honest, when it comes to love
and affection,"
00:12:14.190,00:12:15.600,我并不相信缘分一说,00:12:15.190,00:12:16.644,I don’t believe in fate.
00:12:16.690,00:12:18.230,人们常常以缘分深厚,,,
00:12:18.480,00:12:19.440,作为亲近的借口,00:12:17.690,00:12:20.740,"People often use “deeply shared fate”
as an excuse to get close to someone."
00:12:19.940,00:12:20.730,而以无缘,,,
00:12:21.190,00:12:23.150,作为了却情意的假词而已,00:12:20.940,00:12:24.039,"And “we are not fated” as a pretense
to end an attachment."
00:12:26.820,00:12:27.690,娘子的言论,,,
00:12:27.990,00:12:29.860,总让人觉得柳暗花明又一村,00:12:27.820,00:12:29.212,I always find your remarks
,,,00:12:29.212,00:12:30.860,strangely insightful.
00:12:30.830,00:12:33.950,仿佛有尽之时 又别有一番天地,00:12:31.830,00:12:35.128,You draw a conclusion that leads to a new idea.
00:12:34.790,00:12:35.910,王爷过分夸奖了,00:12:35.612,00:12:37.058,Your Lordship flatters me.
00:12:37.090,00:12:39.000,或许有一天真到了无路可去,,,
00:12:39.300,00:12:40.250,无法可解的地步,00:12:38.090,00:12:41.332,"Maybe one day if I had nowhere to go
and no future,"
00:12:40.760,00:12:43.210,我也会说缘分已尽了吧,00:12:41.582,00:12:44.210,then I would agree it must have been fated.
00:12:46.590,00:12:48.630,若是在从前娘子得意之时,00:12:47.590,00:12:50.000,Not believing in fate would not be surprising
00:12:49.060,00:12:50.920,娘子的这些话不足为奇,00:12:50.060,00:12:52.275,when you were in your prime.
00:12:51.810,00:12:53.970,只是现在娘子依傍佛祖修行,00:12:52.810,00:12:55.414,"But now that you live by Buddha's side,"
00:12:54.940,00:12:56.270,却也不相信缘分吗,00:12:55.674,00:12:57.315,don't you believe in fate?
00:12:58.150,00:12:59.390,即便入寺修行,00:12:58.972,00:13:00.390,I am living in a temple
00:12:59.940,00:13:01.850,但我也有自己所坚持的信念,00:13:00.629,00:13:03.205,but I also hold on to some beliefs of my own.
00:13:03.110,00:13:04.480,更何况佛法精深,00:13:04.110,00:13:05.791,Buddhism is so profound
00:13:05.410,00:13:06.820,我也未曾全都懂得,00:13:06.232,00:13:08.086,and I've never understood it entirely.
00:13:07.780,00:13:10.400,只希望佛法博远 可以安定人心,00:13:08.580,00:13:11.733,"I just hope that Buddha's all-embracing teachings
can bring peace into people's hearts."
00:13:11.540,00:13:12.490,至于缘分,00:13:12.540,00:13:13.756,"As for fate,"
00:13:14.710,00:13:16.070,我总觉得事在人为,00:13:15.266,00:13:17.514,"I always feel that things are more
determined by people's actions."
00:13:16.920,00:13:18.000,聚散离合,00:13:17.920,00:13:19.670,There is no need to use the word “fate”
00:13:18.670,00:13:20.500,都不必拿缘分二字做托词,00:13:19.670,00:13:21.678,to explain encounters and partings.
00:13:30.680,00:13:32.590,芳若姑姑 你怎么来了,00:13:31.281,00:13:33.369,"Madam Orchid, what brings you here?"
00:13:32.770,00:13:33.420,娘子,00:13:33.369,00:13:34.463,Mistress.
00:13:34.980,00:13:35.890,快坐娘子,00:13:35.802,00:13:37.067,"Sit down, Mistress."
00:13:37.730,00:13:40.640,你看这是温太医开的,,,
00:13:40.900,00:13:42.140,产后调理的方子,00:13:38.730,00:13:43.358,"You see, this is a postnatal formula prescribed by Dr. Wen."
00:13:42.860,00:13:44.570,是惠贵人让拿过来的,00:13:43.638,00:13:45.570,Lady Vertu asked me to bring it to you.
00:13:44.990,00:13:47.650,药都配好了 娘子照着吃就是了,00:13:45.812,00:13:48.694,"The medicine has been measured,
so you can take it accordingly."
00:13:48.700,00:13:49.900,还有这些衣裳,,,
00:13:50.490,00:13:51.950,都是敬妃娘娘拿过来,00:13:49.460,00:13:50.926,And these clothes
00:13:52.330,00:13:53.190,给您换洗用的,00:13:51.378,00:13:54.252,"are from Consort Estime,
to provide you additional changes of clothes."
00:13:54.700,00:13:56.990,眉姐姐好吗 胧月好吗,00:13:55.221,00:13:57.901,Is Meizhuang well? And Longyue?
00:13:57.330,00:13:59.740,都好不过只是,00:13:58.330,00:14:00.740,They are both well. It's just….
00:14:00.210,00:14:01.820,你只是关心她们两位,00:14:01.032,00:14:02.775,you ask only about them.
00:14:02.380,00:14:04.960,也不问问太后娘娘近况如何吗,00:14:03.380,00:14:06.226,"Aren't you going to ask about
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager?"
00:14:06.590,00:14:07.920,眉姐姐在宫中,,,
00:14:08.260,00:14:10.880,依托太后的照拂才得平安,00:14:07.590,00:14:11.915,"Meizhuang relies on Her Majesty's
graces in the palace."
00:14:11.720,00:14:12.840,若眉姐姐安好,00:14:12.542,00:14:13.884,"If Meizhuang is well,"
00:14:13.350,00:14:15.430,那太后必然一切安好,00:14:14.128,00:14:16.297,then Her Majesty must be well too.
00:14:16.680,00:14:19.680,那皇上呢 娘子也不在意了吗,00:14:17.680,00:14:20.858,"What about His Majesty,
don't you care about him anymore?"
00:14:21.650,00:14:23.730,若有国丧天下皆知,00:14:22.211,00:14:25.085,"If there was national mourning,
all under Heaven would be notified."
00:14:24.360,00:14:26.270,就不必等姑姑来告诉娘子了,00:14:25.360,00:14:27.492,So I wouldn't need to hear it from you.
00:14:26.690,00:14:28.730,娘子你糊涂了,00:14:27.690,00:14:29.730,"Mistress, you misspoke."
00:14:30.200,00:14:33.690,娘子恕奴碑多嘴劝一句,00:14:30.721,00:14:34.468,"Mistress, pardon me for saying this."
00:14:34.700,00:14:37.440,您这样怨恨在心不能释怀,00:14:35.700,00:14:38.573,Your inability to let go of your resentments
00:14:38.250,00:14:40.160,实际上也是自己难受啊,00:14:38.939,00:14:41.298,is causing yourself more suffering.
00:14:43.090,00:14:45.580,这是太后赏的阿胶膏,00:14:44.090,00:14:46.713,This is the ejiao granted by the Empress Dowager.
00:14:46.050,00:14:48.660,滋身补气 调和气血是最好的,00:14:46.713,00:14:49.663,It's good for replenishing qi and regulating circulation.
00:14:49.260,00:14:50.960,太后说吃了它,,,
00:14:51.260,00:14:53.470,希望您能够更心平气和些,00:14:50.260,00:14:54.269,"Her Majesty hopes it will help
calm your qi and your mind."
00:14:54.470,00:14:55.680,我是戴罪之身,00:14:55.115,00:14:56.902,I am guilty of my offences.
00:14:56.560,00:14:58.800,太后还这样百般垂怜,00:14:57.382,00:15:00.000,I thank Her Majesty for still having pity on me.
00:14:59.730,00:15:00.970,娘子是明白人,00:15:00.374,00:15:02.290,"Mistress, you are intelligent."
00:15:01.690,00:15:04.650,也该知道太后虽然七病八难的,00:15:02.290,00:15:05.629,"You understand although
Her Majesty is ailed by sickness,"
00:15:04.940,00:15:06.350,但是心里并不糊涂,00:15:05.629,00:15:07.350,her mind is still clear.
00:15:07.490,00:15:08.690,可有些事情,00:15:08.268,00:15:09.600,"But in some matters,"
00:15:08.950,00:15:10.980,太后也只能明白不能插手,00:15:09.600,00:15:12.113,"Her Majesty cannot intervene
even if she understands."
00:15:12.320,00:15:14.360,娘子如今在甘露寺修行,00:15:13.098,00:15:15.666,"Mistress, since you are now living in the temple,"
00:15:15.120,00:15:18.160,不如再为太后抄录佛经祈福吧,00:15:15.844,00:15:19.426,"why don't you copy some sutras
to pray for Her Majesty?"
00:15:20.000,00:15:20.990,奴碑每个月,,,
00:15:21.290,00:15:23.370,都会来甘露寺一次取走佛经,00:15:20.622,00:15:24.365,I will come here once a month to retrieve them.
00:15:24.500,00:15:25.290,太后说,,,
00:15:25.750,00:15:28.370,一定要娘子亲手抄录的才有用,00:15:25.374,00:15:29.237,"Her Majesty said that the sutras will
only be effective if copied by you."
00:15:29.670,00:15:31.630,请代我多谢太后关怀之意,00:15:30.492,00:15:32.818,Please thank Her Majesty profusely for me.
00:15:32.890,00:15:34.420,莫愁必定尽心尽力,,,
00:15:34.800,00:15:35.920,为太后抄录佛经,00:15:33.535,00:15:36.929,I will put forth my best effort to copy the sutras
00:15:36.890,00:15:39.180,为太后祈求上苍福泽,00:15:37.624,00:15:40.675,"and pray for Heaven's blessings
on Her Majesty."
00:15:42.310,00:15:44.770,马上胧月公主快周岁了,00:15:43.310,00:15:45.726,Princess Longyue is turning one soon.
00:15:45.440,00:15:46.560,虽然不是大宴,00:15:46.174,00:15:47.892,"Although there won't be a large banquet,"
00:15:47.070,00:15:48.980,但宫里却当大事来看,00:15:47.892,00:15:50.000,the palace still regards it an important event.
00:15:49.690,00:15:52.360,不知收了多少金银珠玉的贺礼呢,00:15:50.424,00:15:53.227,"The princess must have
received many valuable gifts."
00:15:53.280,00:15:54.020,那就好,00:15:53.880,00:15:55.198,That's wonderful.
00:15:55.490,00:15:57.530,否则没有生母在身边的女儿,,,
00:15:58.540,00:15:59.740,总是会吃亏些,00:15:56.268,00:16:00.572,"A princess living without her
birth mother is usually less favored."
00:16:00.830,00:16:03.790,虽然温宜公主有端妃娘娘抚育,00:16:01.608,00:16:04.568,"Although Princess Wenyi is
fostered by Consort Honnête,"
00:16:04.250,00:16:05.660,但是不及胧月公主,,,
00:16:06.000,00:16:07.160,得皇上的宠爱呢,00:16:05.028,00:16:08.036,His Majesty still adores Princess Longyue more.
00:16:08.210,00:16:09.120,皇子尚且可以,,,
00:16:09.380,00:16:11.210,凭借自身之力奋发向上,00:16:09.032,00:16:12.222,"A prince can rely on his own strength
to strive for a higher status,"
00:16:12.340,00:16:14.460,而公主一生的前程与际遇,00:16:13.074,00:16:15.194,but the future of a princess
00:16:15.180,00:16:15.710,都维系在,,,
00:16:16.050,00:16:18.340,她皇阿玛的怜惜与疼爱之上,00:16:15.904,00:16:19.360,relies solely upon her imperial father's favor.
00:16:23.980,00:16:25.840,如今纯元皇后的遗物,,,
00:16:26.440,00:16:27.600,都是谁在保管呢,00:16:24.714,00:16:28.749,"Do you know who is currently looking after
the Empress Première's belongings?"
00:16:28.610,00:16:30.470,纯元皇后最贴身,,,
00:16:30.740,00:16:32.440,最喜欢的衣物和首饰,00:16:29.388,00:16:34.444,"Empress Première's favorite clothing
and accessories are kept by His Majesty."
00:16:32.700,00:16:33.650,都在皇上那里,,,
00:16:34.160,00:16:36.360,其余的由皇后保管,00:16:34.894,00:16:37.280,The rest is kept by the Empress.
00:16:36.780,00:16:38.150,太后那里也有一些,00:16:37.558,00:16:39.518,The Empress Dowager also has some.
00:16:38.740,00:16:39.980,那纯元皇后生前,00:16:39.518,00:16:41.189,Did Empress Première have ...
00:16:41.200,00:16:44.540,有没有她心爱的首饰项圈之类的,00:16:41.722,00:16:45.419,any favorite accessory such as a choker?
00:16:45.630,00:16:47.620,纯元皇后有一个,,,
00:16:47.960,00:16:50.580,用羊脂美玉做成的芙蓉项圈,00:16:46.364,00:16:51.150,"Empress Première had a hibiscus choker
made of suet white jade."
00:16:50.920,00:16:52.210,是她生前最喜爱的,00:16:51.328,00:16:53.388,It was her favorite.
00:16:52.760,00:16:55.670,好像是大婚那天皇上亲手所赐,00:16:53.582,00:16:56.625,"I believe it was a gift presented by
His Majesty on their grand wedding."
00:16:56.390,00:17:00.220,那若以寻常的白玉求形似能不能,00:16:57.035,00:17:01.087,"Can regular white jade be used to
create a similar choker?"
00:17:00.560,00:17:01.390,这个简单,00:17:01.087,00:17:02.701,That wouldn't be difficult.
00:17:03.850,00:17:05.890,槿汐拿我的那个珠花,00:17:04.672,00:17:07.067,"Jinxi, retrieve my jewelry box."
00:17:10.070,00:17:11.770,胧月是我唯一的女儿,00:17:10.892,00:17:12.681,Longyue is my only daughter.
00:17:12.740,00:17:13.850,我这个做生母的,00:17:13.562,00:17:15.280,"As her birth mother,"
00:17:14.650,00:17:16.140,只想稍稍尽一点心意,00:17:15.472,00:17:17.717,I wish I could show how much I care for her.
00:17:18.280,00:17:20.240,请芳若姑姑拿着这些首饰,00:17:19.058,00:17:21.196,"Madam Orchid, please take all my jewelry"
00:17:20.700,00:17:23.320,请内务府的工匠们赶紧雕琢一块,00:17:21.434,00:17:23.200,and ask the craftsmen at the Household Department
00:17:23.660,00:17:24.900,如我方才所说的项圈,00:17:23.200,00:17:25.778,to craft a choker similar to what you described.
00:17:25.790,00:17:28.410,能让胧月在生辰那日戴上,00:17:26.479,00:17:29.365,"If Longyue can wear it on her birthday,"
00:17:29.340,00:17:32.250,也算我这个做生母的尽点心意,00:17:30.000,00:17:33.320,it could be a token of my love for her.
00:17:36.880,00:17:38.470,娘子身边的积蓄不多,00:17:37.702,00:17:39.680,"Mistress, you don't have a lot of savings."
00:17:39.100,00:17:41.800,再说请工匠也花费不了这么多,00:17:39.789,00:17:42.720,"Besides, it doesn't cost
this much to hire a craftsman."
00:17:42.850,00:17:44.050,有这个就足够了,00:17:43.584,00:17:45.120,This bracelet is enough.
00:17:45.850,00:17:46.890,娘子放心吧,00:17:46.450,00:17:47.840,"Don't worry, Mistress."
00:17:47.310,00:17:49.680,奴碑一定会尽力去做的,00:17:47.840,00:17:50.680,I will do my utmost.
00:17:51.520,00:17:52.350,多谢姑姑,00:17:52.254,00:17:53.795,"Thank you, Madam Orchid."
00:17:58.410,00:18:00.490,外头冷娘子请回吧,00:17:59.200,00:18:01.724,"Mistress, it's cold outside. Please return."
00:18:06.210,00:18:09.370,太后请娘子抄录的经书,,,
00:18:10.330,00:18:12.290,奴碑每月都会来取的,00:18:06.918,00:18:13.097,"I will come retrieve the sutras monthly
as the Empress Dowager requested."
00:18:13.050,00:18:16.000,望娘子尽心为太后抄录就是,00:18:13.784,00:18:17.134,I hope you will be conscientious about copying the sutras for Her Majesty.
00:18:16.840,00:18:18.710,莫愁谨遵太后爵旨,00:18:17.662,00:18:19.778,I will obey Her Majesty's command.
00:18:20.800,00:18:22.840,来了来了 快走快走快走 快点,00:18:21.534,00:18:23.574,"She's coming. Hurry, let's move."
00:18:34.780,00:18:36.770,小姐方才为什么不告诉芳若姑姑,,,
00:18:37.150,00:18:37.890,请她主持公道,00:18:35.602,00:18:38.826,"My Lady, why didn't you ask
Madam Orchid to bring you justice?"
00:18:38.280,00:18:40.190,或者告诉住持也好啊,00:18:39.004,00:18:41.332,Or ask her to tell Madam Abbess.
00:18:42.910,00:18:44.150,住持心善软弱,00:18:43.644,00:18:45.417,Madam Abbess is kind but unassertive.
00:18:45.200,00:18:46.740,说话尚不如静白管用,00:18:45.978,00:18:47.962,Her words carry less weight than Prioress Jingbai's.
00:18:48.000,00:18:48.860,我离宫后,00:18:48.822,00:18:50.240,"After leaving the palace,"
00:18:49.540,00:18:51.250,那些没能置我于死地的人,00:18:50.240,00:18:52.120,those who wanted me dead then
00:18:51.500,00:18:53.160,自然不肯轻易甘心放手,00:18:52.120,00:18:54.600,aren't just going to let me live in peace now.
00:18:54.590,00:18:56.290,如今我的苦楚多一分,00:18:55.590,00:18:57.556,"The more hardship I have now,"
00:18:57.170,00:18:58.630,她们心里就会安稳一分,00:18:57.992,00:18:59.822,the more at ease their hearts will be.
00:18:59.630,00:19:02.170,对我的胧月就会放松一分,00:19:00.452,00:19:03.170,"That way, they will care less about my Longyue."
00:19:03.720,00:19:06.260,我这个做生母的能为胧月做的,00:19:04.454,00:19:08.640,This is all I can do for my daughter.
00:19:06.810,00:19:07.720,也只有这些了,,,
00:19:09.230,00:19:11.430,太后让娘子每月抄写佛经,,,
00:19:11.770,00:19:12.760,也是为了保全娘子,00:19:10.000,00:19:13.584,"By having you copy the sutras,
Her Majesty is protecting you"
00:19:13.480,00:19:15.350,不让娘子受到她们的暗害,00:19:14.258,00:19:16.394,from being harmed by them.
00:19:37.170,00:19:38.160,长相思砸了,00:19:37.904,00:19:39.569,Endless Longing is broken.
00:19:38.880,00:19:42.840,琴身无碍但这弦却断了,00:19:39.569,00:19:43.795,"The zither itself is fine,
but the string has snapped."
00:19:47.310,00:19:50.010,知音少弦断有谁听,00:19:47.848,00:19:51.596,"“Few understand my melody. Who would
be listening now that I broke my lute string?”"
,,,00:19:51.596,00:19:52.664,[Manifold Little Hills by Yue Fei]
00:19:51.940,00:19:56.430,长相思弦断 自是不必再相思了,00:19:52.664,00:19:55.195,The string of Endless Longing snapped.
,,,00:19:55.684,00:19:57.830,There is no need to long for anyone.
00:20:03.570,00:20:05.730,真好看太好看了,00:20:04.570,00:20:06.730,So pretty.
00:20:05.990,00:20:07.650,是啊看看我们胧月,00:20:06.990,00:20:08.650,Just look at our Longyue.
00:20:08.040,00:20:09.450,从小就是美人坯子,00:20:08.650,00:20:10.450,She has been a natural beauty from birth.
00:20:09.620,00:20:10.580,是啊,00:20:10.450,00:20:11.410,She certainly has.
00:20:10.870,00:20:12.950,看看这身衣裳做得多精细啊,00:20:11.410,00:20:13.950,Just look at how intricate her clothing is.
00:20:14.040,00:20:15.950,好了好了啊好了,00:20:14.596,00:20:16.506,"All right, that's all right."
00:20:16.210,00:20:17.790,皇上驾到,00:20:16.684,00:20:18.486,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:20:23.180,00:20:24.880,皇上金安,00:20:23.780,00:20:25.851,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:20:25.590,00:20:26.250,起来吧,00:20:26.162,00:20:27.212,Rise.
00:20:26.720,00:20:27.840,谢皇上,00:20:27.454,00:20:28.840,I thank Your Majesty.
00:20:33.270,00:20:36.760,朕几日不来胧月都不冲朕笑了,00:20:34.048,00:20:37.538,"I haven't come for a few days.
Longyue won't even smile at me now."
00:20:37.270,00:20:39.100,哪是啊孩子还小,00:20:37.737,00:20:40.000,"Your Majesty, that's not true.
Longyue is so little."
00:20:39.440,00:20:41.680,皇上您一抱她她就笑了,00:20:40.218,00:20:42.458,She will smile once Your Majesty holds her.
00:20:46.280,00:20:46.900,朕抱抱,,,
00:20:47.280,00:20:47.900,来,00:20:46.880,00:20:48.014,"Here, I'll hold her."
,,,00:20:48.014,00:20:48.900,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:20:48.870,00:20:51.110,看看胧月有没有重一些啊,00:20:49.692,00:20:52.198,Let me see if Longyue has grown heavier.
00:21:00.500,00:21:02.120,这副项圈是哪儿来的,00:21:01.278,00:21:03.164,Where did this choker come from?
00:21:03.470,00:21:04.630,这是前几日,,,
00:21:04.880,00:21:06.970,臣妾为胧月公主准备首饰,00:21:04.292,00:21:07.761,"When I was preparing Longyue's accessories a few days ago,"
00:21:07.390,00:21:08.800,发现没有玉项圈,00:21:08.168,00:21:10.000,I realized she was missing a jade choker.
00:21:09.050,00:21:10.920,就让内务府去赶制了一个,00:21:10.050,00:21:12.009,So I had the Household Department make one.
00:21:11.430,00:21:13.260,皇上觉得不好吗,00:21:12.252,00:21:14.260,Does Your Majesty not like it?
00:21:13.560,00:21:17.050,没有只是觉得眼熟挺好看的,00:21:14.560,00:21:18.228,"No, it's pretty. But it looks familiar somehow."
00:21:18.110,00:21:19.060,这样的项圈,,,
00:21:19.730,00:21:22.470,从前的纯元皇后好像也有一个,00:21:18.710,00:21:23.389,I remember Empress Première had a choker similar to this one.
00:21:23.530,00:21:26.560,只是敬妃进府晚没见过罢了,00:21:24.264,00:21:27.520,"But Consort Estime married in late
and never had a chance to see it."
00:21:27.070,00:21:30.060,内务府的东西做工总是差不多的,00:21:27.892,00:21:31.149,The craftsmanship of the Household Department is largely the same.
00:21:31.450,00:21:33.280,只是没有纯元皇后的那副,,,
00:21:33.540,00:21:34.400,做工精巧,00:21:32.228,00:21:35.346,"But this choker is not as finely made
as Empress Première's."
00:21:35.460,00:21:36.160,苏培盛,,,
00:21:36.420,00:21:37.120,奴才在,00:21:36.194,00:21:37.959,"- Su Peisheng.
- Your Majesty."
00:21:37.540,00:21:39.530,去把纯元皇后的那副项圈拿来,00:21:38.318,00:21:40.308,Go retrieve Empress Première's choker
00:21:39.960,00:21:40.790,赐给公主吧,00:21:40.308,00:21:41.790,and give it to the princess.
00:21:41.460,00:21:42.170,嘛,00:21:42.194,00:21:43.436,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:21:43.170,00:21:45.330,臣妾替公主谢过皇上,00:21:43.992,00:21:46.080,I thank Your Majesty on behalf of the princess.
00:21:45.880,00:21:48.550,好了快开席坐着吧,00:21:46.569,00:21:49.712,"All right, the banquet is about to start.
Let's all go get seated."
00:21:48.890,00:21:50.050,咱们胧月也饿了,00:21:49.712,00:21:51.228,Longyue must be hungry now.
00:21:51.180,00:21:53.920,来来来好了好了好了,00:21:51.470,00:21:54.210,"Come here, Longyue. Let's go."
00:21:54.140,00:21:55.010,饿了 饿了 饿了,,,
00:21:55.180,00:21:55.720,走,00:21:54.430,00:21:55.922,"You're hungry, aren't you?"
00:21:55.940,00:21:56.640,走,00:21:55.922,00:21:57.306,"- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go."

00:23:19.440,00:23:22.050,多谢不知该如何称呼您,00:23:20.617,00:23:23.050,"Thank you so much.
How may I address you?"
00:23:23.650,00:23:24.850,叫我冲静便可,00:23:24.462,00:23:25.850,You can call me Serene.
00:23:26.190,00:23:28.770,你在前头甘露寺修行是吧,00:23:26.852,00:23:29.770,You must be living in the Temple of Pure Dew.
00:23:29.240,00:23:29.820,是,00:23:29.770,00:23:30.705,I am.
00:23:31.320,00:23:32.900,我捡的柴火还不够数,00:23:31.906,00:23:33.975,I haven't gathered enough firewood.
00:23:34.240,00:23:35.150,一会儿再回去,00:23:35.052,00:23:36.416,I'll go back later.
00:23:40.750,00:23:42.160,太妃茶好了,00:23:41.336,00:23:43.293,"Your Venerable Highness, the tea is ready."
00:23:44.170,00:23:45.160,好倒吧,00:23:45.040,00:23:46.327,Good. Please serve it.
00:23:46.340,00:23:49.200,您是舒太妃,00:23:47.077,00:23:50.200,Are you ... Consort Dowager Serein？
00:23:51.090,00:23:52.250,你知道我的名号,00:23:51.827,00:23:53.250,You know my title?
00:23:52.840,00:23:56.680,是啊如今该称呼您冲静元师,00:23:53.572,00:23:57.680,"Yes, I should call you Venerable Abbess Serene."
00:23:59.520,00:24:00.720,你是从宫里出来的,00:24:00.181,00:24:01.898,Are you from the palace?
00:24:02.230,00:24:05.060,听说宫中有一位甄娘子,00:24:02.854,00:24:08.656,"I heard a Mistress Zhen from the
palace lives in the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:24:05.940,00:24:09.060,在甘露寺中修行便是你吧,00:24:08.834,00:24:10.238,It must be you.
00:24:12.610,00:24:14.900,恕我刚才眼拙了请,00:24:13.196,00:24:15.260,Pardon me for my blunt eyes.
,,,00:24:15.260,00:24:16.514,Please.
00:24:17.330,00:24:19.820,这是我的贴身侍女名叫积云,00:24:17.954,00:24:20.820,"This is my personal maid, Nebular."
00:24:23.250,00:24:27.490,今日与娘子相见也算机缘巧合了,00:24:23.911,00:24:28.490,It is serendipitous to meet you today.
00:24:28.710,00:24:30.790,自先帝驾崩我出宫以来,00:24:29.443,00:24:32.278,"Ever since I left the palace upon
the prior emperor's passing,"
00:24:32.220,00:24:34.130,便再也未见过宫中之人了,00:24:32.806,00:24:35.200,I haven't met anyone from the palace.
00:24:34.970,00:24:37.710,我与太妃的机缘果然比旁人更深,00:24:35.519,00:24:38.673,"It would seem my fate with Your Venerable
Highness is greater than with others."
00:24:38.510,00:24:39.670,今日相见不说,,,
00:24:40.100,00:24:41.760,我还有一架长相思琴,00:24:39.236,00:24:42.661,"Aside from the fact that we met today,
I also have Endless Longing, the zither, with me."
00:24:42.020,00:24:43.850,正是太妃从前所用的爱物,00:24:42.794,00:24:45.040,"It must have been cherished by
Your Venerable Highness."
00:24:45.400,00:24:46.100,果真,00:24:46.099,00:24:47.062,Really?
00:24:46.730,00:24:48.270,如今就在甘露寺中呢,00:24:47.412,00:24:49.270,It's in the Temple of Pure Dew now.
00:24:52.070,00:24:53.900,当日出宫之时,00:24:52.694,00:24:54.900,"When I left the palace,"
00:24:54.950,00:24:56.690,我把长相思和长相守,,,
00:24:57.570,00:24:58.730,一同留在了宫中,00:24:55.574,00:24:59.680,"I left behind both Endless Longing,
the zither, and Eternal Promise, the flute."
00:24:59.540,00:25:01.150,只为先帝驾鹤,,,
00:25:01.830,00:25:03.870,我留着这两样东西也是无用了,00:25:00.213,00:25:04.847,"Because they were of no use to me
after the prior emperor passed away."
00:25:05.040,00:25:07.000,不曾想竟到了娘子手中,00:25:05.551,00:25:08.120,I never would have expected the zither to be in your possession.
00:25:10.420,00:25:13.880,与此二物一别数年,00:25:11.081,00:25:14.729,It has been many years since I parted with it.
00:25:15.680,00:25:16.840,若娘子首肯,00:25:16.191,00:25:17.840,"If you wouldn't mind,"
00:25:17.340,00:25:19.380,能否带来让我再瞧一瞧,00:25:17.840,00:25:20.380,could you bring it and allow me to take a look at it?
00:25:20.430,00:25:22.010,本该拿给太妃一观的,00:25:21.259,00:25:23.693,"I would have liked to, Your Venerable Highness."
00:25:22.930,00:25:26.180,只是数日前不小心弄断了琴弦,00:25:23.693,00:25:27.169,"But a few days ago, I accidentally broke a string."
00:25:27.810,00:25:29.140,若是娘子放心,00:25:28.321,00:25:30.140,"If you don't mind,"
00:25:29.820,00:25:31.060,不如拿给我看一看,00:25:30.293,00:25:32.060,you can bring it to me.
00:25:31.780,00:25:34.690,我愿尽力一试或可修补,00:25:32.253,00:25:35.464,I will try my best and might be able to fix it.
00:25:36.030,00:25:38.240,能交回太妃手中我就安心了,00:25:36.616,00:25:39.440,"It would bring peace to my mind if it were
back in Your Venerable Highness's possession."
00:25:39.450,00:25:42.160,如实在接不好那只能遗憾,00:25:40.000,00:25:41.779,"If it can not be repaired,"
00:25:42.450,00:25:44.160,再也听不到长相思的妙音了,00:25:41.795,00:25:45.365,"then we need only lament the loss of
Endless Longing's sublime sounds."
00:25:45.210,00:25:49.070,那下次娘子请过来坐坐,00:25:45.721,00:25:52.515,"Please come visit again
and bring Endless Longing with you."
00:25:49.880,00:25:51.580,也带了长相思一同来吧,,,
00:25:52.800,00:25:54.750,我倒很喜欢和娘子说话呢,00:25:53.574,00:25:55.750,I like speaking with you.
00:25:55.670,00:25:58.380,太妃盛情晚辈怎敢不遵呢,00:25:56.444,00:25:59.040,"Your Venerable Highness is so generous.
How could I refuse?"
00:25:59.550,00:26:00.290,请,00:26:00.550,00:26:01.512,Please.
00:26:03.310,00:26:06.890,皇上今儿公主满周岁,00:26:04.310,00:26:05.392,"Your Majesty,"
,,,00:26:05.925,00:26:07.890,the princess turned one today.
00:26:07.390,00:26:09.390,您一高兴喝了那么多的酒,00:26:08.164,00:26:10.280,Your Majesty drank quite a lot.
00:26:09.860,00:26:11.020,赶紧回去歇息吧,00:26:10.390,00:26:11.976,Let's hurry and have you rest.
00:26:11.480,00:26:13.470,要不酒劲儿上来可就难受了,00:26:12.198,00:26:14.648,"Otherwise, Your Majesty will feel uncomfortable from the drinking."
00:26:14.280,00:26:16.190,头有些晕回去吧,00:26:14.791,00:26:17.234,My head feels a little dizzy. Let's go back.
00:26:17.240,00:26:19.820,安嫔娘娘说要陪着您 您也不让,00:26:17.966,00:26:20.853,"Concubine An wanted to accompany Your Majesty,
but you refused Her Highness."
00:26:20.450,00:26:22.240,奴才先送您回养心殿吧,00:26:21.164,00:26:23.729,"Allow me to accompany Your Majesty
back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:26:24.160,00:26:25.240,碎玉轩到了,00:26:24.934,00:26:26.462,It's the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:26:26.120,00:26:27.830,谁在碎玉轩门口站着,00:26:26.894,00:26:28.830,Who is that at the entrance?
00:26:29.540,00:26:31.200,皇上那是四阿哥,00:26:30.164,00:26:32.139,"Your Majesty, that is the Fourth Prince."
00:26:31.920,00:26:33.910,弘历跑到宫里来做什么,00:26:32.694,00:26:34.826,Why did Hongli come to the palace?
00:26:34.340,00:26:35.790,胧月公主过生辰,,,
00:26:36.670,00:26:38.500,除了五阿哥感染风寒,00:26:35.048,00:26:39.001,"All the princes and princesses have come
to celebrate Princess Longyue's birthday."
00:26:38.800,00:26:40.510,其余的皇子公主都来了,00:26:39.001,00:26:41.701,"Except for the Fifth Prince, who caught a cold."
00:26:41.260,00:26:42.970,让他在圆明园好好待着,00:26:41.879,00:26:44.061,Tell Hongli to stay in the Summer Palace.
00:26:43.260,00:26:44.800,没事少在朕面前晃悠,00:26:44.061,00:26:45.799,And not hang around in the palace.
00:26:45.600,00:26:46.210,嘛,00:26:46.224,00:26:47.210,Yes.
00:26:49.270,00:26:50.430,儿臣给皇阿玛请安,00:26:50.000,00:26:51.608,I bow before Imperial Father.
00:26:54.110,00:26:55.190,你在这里做什么,00:26:54.730,00:26:56.320,What are you doing here?
00:26:57.570,00:27:02.650,从前莞娘娘对儿臣很好她,00:26:58.190,00:27:00.000,Her Highness Sourire ...
,,,00:27:00.444,00:27:02.309,She treated me very well.
,,,00:27:02.531,00:27:03.786,She...
00:27:04.540,00:27:06.370,儿臣知道莞娘娘惹皇阿玛生气,00:27:04.961,00:27:07.128,"I understand that Her Highness
angered you, Imperial Father."
00:27:06.580,00:27:07.320,皇阿玛恕罪,00:27:07.128,00:27:08.403,Please forgive me.
00:27:10.500,00:27:11.660,她怎么对你好的,00:27:11.167,00:27:12.808,How did she treat you well?
00:27:12.380,00:27:13.660,莞娘娘教儿臣读书,00:27:13.051,00:27:14.880,Her Highness taught me to read.
00:27:14.290,00:27:16.030,知道儿臣思念皇阿玛,00:27:14.988,00:27:17.120,"She knew that I missed you,"
00:27:16.920,00:27:17.960,也怕吵着皇阿玛,00:27:17.556,00:27:19.248,and that I was afraid of disturbing you.
00:27:19.010,00:27:21.370,让儿臣远远地看一眼皇阿玛,00:27:19.630,00:27:22.389,"So she told me to pay respects
to you from a distance."
00:27:24.100,00:27:25.090,你想见朕,00:27:24.720,00:27:26.130,You wanted to see me?
00:27:25.510,00:27:26.170,是,00:27:26.130,00:27:27.056,Yes.
00:27:27.020,00:27:28.100,回去好好读书,00:27:27.727,00:27:29.507,Go back and see to your books.
00:27:28.730,00:27:31.090,有空朕自然会召见你,00:27:29.685,00:27:31.872,I will call for you when I'm available.
,,,00:27:32.854,00:27:33.760,Yes.
00:27:32.100,00:27:36.100,是谢皇阿玛儿臣告退,00:27:34.994,00:27:37.475,"Thank you, Father. I bid you goodbye."
00:27:44.740,00:27:48.230,皇上碎玉轩如今是惠贵人住着,00:27:45.383,00:27:49.120,"Your Majesty, the Palace of Pearl Jade
has been assigned to Lady Vertu."
00:27:48.790,00:27:49.570,惠贵人,00:27:49.520,00:27:50.795,Lady Vertu?
00:27:50.120,00:27:51.860,太后把这儿赐给惠贵人了,00:27:50.795,00:27:52.934,The Empress Dowager granted it to Lady Vertu.
00:27:52.370,00:27:53.530,过两天就搬进去,00:27:53.112,00:27:54.716,She will be moving in a couple days.
00:27:55.090,00:27:56.870,那朕进去看看,00:27:55.733,00:27:57.824,I will take a look inside then.
00:27:57.300,00:27:57.960,嘛,00:27:58.062,00:27:58.855,Yes.
00:27:58.670,00:27:59.460,落轿,00:27:59.353,00:28:00.661,Lower the sedan.
00:28:21.490,00:28:26.530,甄氏离宫以后这儿就再没动过,00:28:22.110,00:28:27.150,This place has been untouched since Zhen left.
00:28:27.410,00:28:30.620,一直都没 惠贵人也说不让动呢,00:28:28.030,00:28:29.182,Yes.
,,,00:28:30.000,00:28:32.480,"Lady Vertu also requested that
nothing should be changed."
00:28:46.140,00:28:48.420,这是她最心爱的玫瑰替子,00:28:46.760,00:28:49.408,"This was her favorite, the rose hairpin."
00:28:59.480,00:29:05.020,朕赏给她的玉鞋也没带走,00:29:00.187,00:29:02.202,The jade shoes I gifted her...
,,,00:29:04.954,00:29:06.452,She did not bring either.
00:29:14.370,00:29:15.410,什么都没带走,00:29:14.990,00:29:16.296,She took nothing.
00:29:17.420,00:29:19.330,她自己干净利落地走了,00:29:18.262,00:29:20.523,She left swiftly without any attachments.
00:29:22.460,00:29:26.300,皇上您赏她的长相思带走了,00:29:23.080,00:29:27.200,"Your Majesty, she took Endless Longing,
 the zither that you granted."
00:29:35.440,00:29:36.850,长相思,00:29:36.060,00:29:37.603,Endless Longing.
00:29:59.290,00:30:00.000,就是这儿了,00:29:59.910,00:30:01.241,Here we are.
00:30:02.340,00:30:03.000,慢点,00:30:03.006,00:30:04.125,Be careful.
00:30:13.100,00:30:13.880,额娘你看,00:30:13.735,00:30:14.838,"Mother, look."
00:30:19.060,00:30:19.720,王爷,00:30:19.751,00:30:20.800,Your Lordship.
00:30:21.230,00:30:22.770,刚说曹操曹操就到了,00:30:21.850,00:30:23.568,Speaking of the devil.
00:30:23.570,00:30:25.230,可见背后不能说人,00:30:24.190,00:30:26.833,"I should stop talking about
people behind their back."
00:30:26.990,00:30:28.320,才刚从北边回来,,,
00:30:29.240,00:30:30.850,连王府还没来得及回,00:30:27.753,00:30:31.501,"He just arrived from the north,
and came here even before his estate."
00:30:31.740,00:30:32.900,你来得也巧啊,00:30:32.439,00:30:34.040,You came at the perfect time.
00:30:33.540,00:30:34.780,见今儿天气挺好,00:30:34.215,00:30:35.520,"The weather is nice today,"
00:30:35.120,00:30:36.830,便把长相思带来给太妃,00:30:35.771,00:30:38.080,"so I brought Endless Longing
for Your Venerable Highness."
00:30:38.960,00:30:39.870,我闯下的祸,,,
00:30:40.210,00:30:41.740,如今倒要太妃来为我弥补,00:30:39.580,00:30:43.047,"This was my own mistake, but I'm relying
on Your Venerable Highness's help now."
00:30:42.750,00:30:44.330,这位是我的贴身丫髻浣碧,00:30:43.415,00:30:45.374,"This is my personal maid, Jade."
00:30:45.050,00:30:46.660,特意带来给太妃请安,00:30:45.670,00:30:47.813,I brought her here to pay our respects.
00:30:47.550,00:30:49.290,浣碧给太妃和王爷请安,00:30:48.217,00:30:50.312,Peace to Your Venerable Highness and Your lordship
00:30:50.840,00:30:52.800,浣碧啊 难得向我行这样大的礼,00:30:51.547,00:30:53.600,Jade rarely bows to me formally.
00:30:53.220,00:30:54.510,今天是沾了额娘的光,00:30:53.855,00:30:55.587,I guess I'm benefiting from you being here.
00:30:58.520,00:31:01.890,眉眼生得齐整长得细皮白肉的,00:30:59.520,00:31:02.890,"You have pretty eyes.
And your skin is fair and delicate."
00:31:02.980,00:31:06.520,瞧这双眼睛长得倒和娘子很像,00:31:03.980,00:31:07.298,"Looking at your eyes,
they resemble your Mistress's."
00:31:07.740,00:31:09.350,从前没仔细看倒也不觉得,00:31:08.740,00:31:10.439,I hadn't noticed that before.
00:31:10.410,00:31:11.610,今天额娘这么一说,,,
00:31:12.490,00:31:13.900,还真觉得像一对姐妹啊,00:31:11.410,00:31:14.747,"Now you mention it, I do think
you two look like sisters."
00:31:14.620,00:31:15.780,浣碧同我一同长大,,,
00:31:16.330,00:31:17.320,的确情同姐妹,00:31:15.620,00:31:18.498,"We grew up together.
We are as close as sisters."
00:31:18.250,00:31:20.780,如今我父亲和母亲被远放甯古塔,00:31:19.250,00:31:21.869,"Now that my parents have been banished to Ninguta,"
00:31:21.630,00:31:22.660,我如此落魄,,,
00:31:23.130,00:31:25.290,倒让她跟着我受了不少委屈,00:31:22.630,00:31:26.280,"she has gone through a lot of
hardship because of my status."
00:31:26.170,00:31:27.660,天下尽是可怜的人,00:31:26.857,00:31:28.946,Everyone in this world suffers hardship.
00:31:28.670,00:31:31.760,这孩子跟你一样 我一见就喜欢,00:31:29.670,00:31:32.760,"I liked her at first sight, just as I did with you."
00:31:32.220,00:31:34.130,所以我不想因为我,,,
00:31:34.430,00:31:35.760,而影响浣碧终生,00:31:33.220,00:31:36.760,"I don't want the rest of her life
to be ruined because of me."
00:31:36.430,00:31:37.640,若有合适的机会,,,
00:31:37.970,00:31:39.380,还请太妃与王爷做主,00:31:37.430,00:31:38.880,"If there's an appropriate match,"
00:31:39.810,00:31:41.100,给浣碧找一户好人家,00:31:38.970,00:31:42.346,"I hope Your Venerable Highness and Your Lordship
could help to betroth her to a good family."
00:31:41.810,00:31:43.220,也算了却我一桩心愿,,,
00:31:43.610,00:31:44.590,小姐何出此言,00:31:42.560,00:31:44.432,That would also fulfill a cherished desire of mine.
00:31:45.610,00:31:47.020,怕是早就已经嫌弃我,00:31:44.432,00:31:46.167,"My Lady, why would you say that?"
00:31:47.320,00:31:48.520,想把我早早打发了吧,00:31:46.610,00:31:49.698,Do you resent me and want to send me away?
00:31:49.490,00:31:52.520,你家小姐是想为你打算周全,00:31:50.490,00:31:53.520,Your Mistress is planning ahead for you.
00:31:53.990,00:31:56.230,额娘把这件事就托付给你了,00:31:54.812,00:31:57.185,"Yunli, I'm entrusting this matter to you."
00:31:57.290,00:31:58.490,你一定要为浣碧,,,
00:31:58.790,00:32:00.450,好好寻一个好人家,00:31:58.290,00:32:01.480,You must find a good match for Jade.
00:32:00.870,00:32:03.410,额娘放心 孩儿一定记在心上,00:32:01.870,00:32:04.499,"Mother, please be assured. I will keep it in mind."
00:32:06.250,00:32:07.580,方才听太妃说起,00:32:07.028,00:32:08.960,I just heard from Her Venerable Highness that
00:32:07.960,00:32:10.250,王爷这几月去了北地一带,00:32:08.960,00:32:11.561,"Your Lordship was visiting the far north
for the past few months."
00:32:11.380,00:32:12.370,皇兄一时兴起,,,
00:32:12.630,00:32:13.870,命我微服去北地一带,00:32:12.380,00:32:13.986,"His Majesty sent me on a whim,"
00:32:14.260,00:32:15.470,留心官员政绩如何,00:32:13.986,00:32:16.628,"to inspect the officials in the north
under the disguise of plain clothes."
00:32:15.890,00:32:17.050,仓促得命就去了,,,
00:32:17.390,00:32:18.630,也来不及告别一句,00:32:16.890,00:32:19.733,"I left in such a hurry that
I wasn't able to bid you farewell."
00:32:19.640,00:32:22.010,如此一别也快三个月了,00:32:20.640,00:32:23.010,It's been nearly three months since we last met.
00:32:23.520,00:32:26.310,自上次与娘子一别八十七日了,00:32:24.520,00:32:27.310,"Yes, it has been eighty-seven days."
00:32:27.400,00:32:28.680,王爷的记性真好,00:32:28.400,00:32:29.769,Your Lordship has a good memory.
00:32:29.190,00:32:30.430,王爷博闻广记,00:32:30.190,00:32:31.649,Your Lordship is well-learned.
00:32:31.070,00:32:33.610,这次虽然去的时间很久,,,
00:32:33.950,00:32:35.060,但也算有所收获,00:32:32.070,00:32:35.942,"The trip was long, but quite fruitful."
00:32:35.620,00:32:37.230,中间转道去了一趟甯古塔,00:32:36.620,00:32:38.673,I took the opportunity to detour by Ningguta.
00:32:38.120,00:32:39.280,这封信给娘子,00:32:39.076,00:32:40.414,This letter is for you.
00:32:43.500,00:32:44.450,是我父亲的信,00:32:44.500,00:32:45.560,From my father?
,,,00:32:46.072,00:32:46.826,Yes.
00:32:51.210,00:32:55.500,娱儿我与你母亲俱好安心即可,00:32:52.210,00:32:55.171,"Huan'er, your mother and I are doing well."
,,,00:32:55.171,00:32:56.811,No need to worry about us.
00:32:56.050,00:32:59.170,闻得儿与浣碧同在甘露寺修行,00:32:57.050,00:33:00.170,"I learned that you and Jade are practicing
Buddhism in the Temple of Pure Dew."
00:32:59.470,00:33:00.210,亦好,00:33:00.170,00:33:01.521,This is also good.
00:33:00.930,00:33:03.890,大局已定 莫做徒劳之工,00:33:01.930,00:33:04.979,"The pieces are already in place.
Don't make any futile efforts."
00:33:04.190,00:33:06.720,各自天涯 各自珍重,00:33:05.190,00:33:07.940,"Let us all take care of ourselves
at each end of this earth."
00:33:06.940,00:33:08.800,切莫过于挂怀,00:33:07.940,00:33:10.000,Don't miss us too much.
00:33:09.150,00:33:10.310,从信上可以看出,00:33:10.150,00:33:11.690,It can be seen from the letter that
00:33:10.690,00:33:13.310,甄伯父笔力犹健 身子没有大碍,00:33:11.690,00:33:14.955,"Uncle Zhen is healthy since
his writing is vigorous and forceful."
00:33:14.400,00:33:15.560,甄伯父自己也说,,,
00:33:16.160,00:33:17.770,远离朝廷纷争既淡,00:33:15.400,00:33:18.760,He also said he is living a more peaceful life
00:33:18.240,00:33:19.230,过得反而舒心些,00:33:19.062,00:33:21.022,away from the quarrels of the imperial court.
00:33:20.990,00:33:22.530,甯古塔终年苦寒,00:33:21.990,00:33:23.841,Ningguta is harsh and bleak all year round.
00:33:24.330,00:33:26.370,父亲与母亲年事已高,00:33:25.330,00:33:27.370,My parents are advanced in years.
00:33:27.250,00:33:28.580,叫我如何放心,00:33:28.250,00:33:29.778,How can I rest assured?
00:33:30.340,00:33:31.920,甯古塔虽苦寒,00:33:31.340,00:33:33.098,"Although Ninguta is bleak and harsh,"
00:33:33.380,00:33:36.500,但是人却可以得一夕自在,00:33:34.380,00:33:37.500,it offers a time of solitude.
00:33:37.840,00:33:39.430,今番与甄伯父一聚,,,
00:33:39.890,00:33:40.750,听他言语之间,00:33:38.840,00:33:40.652,"When I visited Uncle Zhen,"
00:33:41.100,00:33:42.840,颇有随遇而安的欣慰之意,00:33:40.890,00:33:43.840,"I could sense from his words that
he was at peace with his predicament."
00:33:43.810,00:33:45.670,朝廷中纷争内斗无数,,,
00:33:45.940,00:33:47.020,纵然风光繁华,00:33:44.810,00:33:46.940,"The imperial court might look grand and glorious,"
00:33:47.900,00:33:49.600,然而甄伯父年事已高,00:33:46.940,00:33:48.480,but it's full of conflicts and fights.
00:33:50.230,00:33:52.140,能有一方安乐清静之处,00:33:48.900,00:33:50.720,"At an advanced age,"
00:33:52.440,00:33:53.310,他亦能自足,00:33:51.230,00:33:54.454,Uncle Zhen can find satisfaction in a peaceful place.
00:33:53.990,00:33:57.150,烽火连三月家书抵万金,00:33:54.990,00:33:58.150,"""With the flames of war unending for three months,
a letter from home is worth ten thousand pieces of gold."""
00:33:58.320,00:33:59.310,多谢王爷了,00:33:59.320,00:34:00.443,I thank Your Lordship.
00:34:00.490,00:34:01.650,我与娘子知交一场,00:34:01.490,00:34:02.694,You are my confidant.
00:34:02.540,00:34:03.820,何苦说这样见外的话,00:34:03.540,00:34:04.953,You need not stand on ceremony.
00:34:07.960,00:34:09.740,额娘方才说起浣碧的婚事,00:34:08.960,00:34:10.740,My mother mentioned Jade's marriage earlier.
00:34:10.340,00:34:11.290,我倒有一个人选,,,
00:34:11.800,00:34:13.000,不知娘子意下如何,00:34:11.340,00:34:12.512,I have someone in mind.
,,,00:34:12.800,00:34:14.720,I would like to know your thoughts on it.
00:34:18.220,00:34:18.880,阿晋,,,
00:34:19.050,00:34:19.710,什么,00:34:19.220,00:34:20.880,"- Ajin.
- What?"
00:34:21.850,00:34:23.550,阿晋打小和我一起长大,00:34:22.850,00:34:24.550,He's grown up with me since childhood.
00:34:23.930,00:34:25.590,他的人品我自然是能担保的,00:34:24.930,00:34:26.590,So I can vouch for his character.
00:34:26.060,00:34:27.670,况且他和浣碧也算是熟识,00:34:27.060,00:34:28.880,"Moreover, he and Jade
are already somewhat familiar."
00:34:27.980,00:34:29.090,算不得是盲婚盲嫁,00:34:28.980,00:34:30.312,So it's not a blind marriage.
00:34:30.150,00:34:33.230,这个王爷说什么就是什么,00:34:31.150,00:34:34.230,"Well, if Your Lordship says so."
00:34:34.400,00:34:37.610,王爷即便阿晋愿意,00:34:35.400,00:34:36.659,"Your Lordship,"
00:34:37.990,00:34:38.690,我也是不愿意的,00:34:37.458,00:34:39.800,I won't agree even if Ajin does.
00:34:40.530,00:34:42.570,小姐要在甘露寺中修行一辈子,00:34:41.352,00:34:44.200,"My Lady is to practice Buddhism in the
temple for the rest of her life."
00:34:43.200,00:34:45.410,若离了我就只有槿汐一个人了,00:34:44.200,00:34:46.588,She will only have Jinxi if I leave her.
00:34:46.410,00:34:47.950,况且我视小姐为长姐,,,
00:34:48.420,00:34:50.200,我怎么忍心让小姐一个人受苦,00:34:47.410,00:34:49.128,I regard My Lady as my elder sister.
00:34:50.670,00:34:51.950,自己却贪福嫁人去了,00:34:49.420,00:34:53.280,"How could I have the heart to live
comfortably while she is left to suffer?"
00:34:54.920,00:34:58.410,浣碧你若嫁给阿晋为妻,00:34:55.920,00:34:56.918,"Jade,"
00:34:58.880,00:35:00.000,常居住在清凉台,00:34:58.250,00:35:01.178,"if you marry Ajin, you can live
in the Cooling Terrace."
00:35:00.430,00:35:02.260,与娘子也是可以常常见面的,00:35:01.430,00:35:03.260,You can still see her frequently.
00:35:02.720,00:35:04.050,或者接娘子来清凉台小住,,,
00:35:04.260,00:35:05.000,也是可以的,00:35:03.720,00:35:06.306,"You can also invite her to stay
with you from time to time."
00:35:07.310,00:35:08.420,那么王爷的意思,,,
00:35:09.270,00:35:10.810,究竟是让我嫁给阿晋呢,00:35:08.310,00:35:11.800,Is Your Lordship's intention to marry me to Ajin
00:35:11.310,00:35:12.640,还是借我和阿晋婚后,,,
00:35:12.980,00:35:13.970,让小姐久住清凉台,00:35:12.310,00:35:15.271,so that My Lady will stay at the Cooling Terrace?
00:35:14.770,00:35:16.480,究竟是方便我们姐妹相见呢,00:35:15.770,00:35:17.746,"Are you trying to help me
and My Lady to see each other,"
00:35:17.070,00:35:18.680,还是方便王爷与小姐相见,00:35:18.070,00:35:20.000,or helping yourself to see My Lady?
00:35:19.400,00:35:21.610,有些话王爷大可说得明白,00:35:20.400,00:35:22.610,Your Lordship might as well make that clear.
00:35:21.780,00:35:22.440,浣碧,00:35:22.610,00:35:23.492,Jade!
00:35:27.790,00:35:30.400,浣碧你是在帮着嬛儿,00:35:28.790,00:35:29.934,"Jade,"
,,,00:35:30.245,00:35:31.997,"are you trying to help Huan'er,"
00:35:31.880,00:35:33.160,还是在伤她的心呢,00:35:32.752,00:35:34.294,or upset her?
00:35:34.840,00:35:35.500,小姐,00:35:35.840,00:35:36.856,My Lady.
00:35:36.090,00:35:39.630,王爷唤错了我的法号是莫愁,00:35:37.090,00:35:38.547,Your Lordship misspoke my name.
00:35:44.470,00:35:46.430,浣碧的婚事匆匆说定也不好,00:35:39.479,00:35:41.163, My monastic name is Mochou.
00:35:46.850,00:35:47.880,不如以后从长计议,00:35:45.470,00:35:47.850,"It wouldn't be good to make a hasty
decision about Jade's marriage."
00:35:48.480,00:35:49.130,不必了,00:35:47.850,00:35:49.280,We shall give the matter further thought.
,,,00:35:49.480,00:35:50.885,That won't be necessary.
00:35:50.310,00:35:53.220,匆匆也好从长计议也罢,00:35:51.310,00:35:54.220,"Whether it's a quick decision or carefully thought out,"
00:35:54.440,00:35:55.680,我若不喜欢一个人,,,
00:35:56.230,00:35:57.470,断断是不会嫁给他的,00:35:55.440,00:35:58.440,I won't marry someone I don't have feelings for.
00:35:58.490,00:35:59.690,我若喜欢一个人,00:35:59.490,00:36:01.440,"But if it's someone I love,"
00:36:00.610,00:36:03.980,即使嫁给他做妾也是心甘情愿的,00:36:01.583,00:36:05.049,"I wouldn't have any regrets even if I were only to
become his secondary wife."
00:36:05.950,00:36:06.940,可是事到如今,00:36:06.950,00:36:08.895,"But in the current situation,"
00:36:07.990,00:36:09.280,我就只想陪着小姐,00:36:08.895,00:36:10.720,I just want to be with My Lady.
00:36:13.170,00:36:15.700,我到底是配不上浣碧姑娘的,00:36:14.170,00:36:16.700,I don't deserve Jade after all.
00:36:16.920,00:36:18.210,浣碧一向心气高,00:36:17.920,00:36:19.654,Jade has her temperament and aspirations.
00:36:19.260,00:36:21.210,如今又与我一同经历家变,00:36:20.260,00:36:22.521,"Having been through my family's
 misfortunes together,"
00:36:21.840,00:36:23.420,难免很多事情都看淡了,00:36:22.840,00:36:24.686,she has stopped caring about many things.
00:36:24.430,00:36:25.540,还请王爷见谅,00:36:25.430,00:36:26.960,I hope Your Lordship can forgive her.
00:36:27.720,00:36:29.840,今日之事是我鲁莽了,00:36:28.720,00:36:30.840,I acted rashly today.
00:36:31.810,00:36:34.180,我回去一定好好劝劝她,00:36:32.810,00:36:35.358,I will talk to her about it after we get back.
00:36:52.960,00:36:53.740,好些了吗,00:36:53.960,00:36:55.051,Feeling better?
00:36:56.460,00:36:57.920,我知道王爷是为了我好,00:36:55.362,00:36:56.266,Yes.
00:36:59.380,00:37:00.330,在王爷眼里,00:36:57.460,00:36:59.275,I know that His Lordship was acting for my benefit.
00:37:01.260,00:37:02.710,我只是小姐的一个丫髻,00:37:00.380,00:37:03.680,I'm just your maid in his eyes.
00:37:04.130,00:37:05.120,所以能嫁的,00:37:05.130,00:37:06.463,"So naturally,"
00:37:07.390,00:37:09.130,自然只是他的亲信随从,00:37:08.327,00:37:10.298,I can only marry his attendant.
00:37:11.020,00:37:14.100,浣碧你一向聪明,00:37:12.020,00:37:13.160,"Jade,"
00:37:14.770,00:37:15.980,可别钻了牛角尖,00:37:13.826,00:37:15.766,you have a sharp mind.
,,,00:37:15.770,00:37:16.980,But don't chase a dead end.
00:37:17.810,00:37:19.730,王爷虽不知你是我的亲妹妹,00:37:18.810,00:37:21.174,"Although His Lordship
doesn't know you are my sister,"
00:37:20.530,00:37:22.730,但他也知道我与你情同姐妹,00:37:21.530,00:37:23.863,he knows we have a sisterly bond.
00:37:23.530,00:37:25.640,怎么会轻易把你打发给随从呢,00:37:24.530,00:37:26.951,He wouldn't hastily betroth you to his attendant.
00:37:26.870,00:37:28.110,何况正是因为这样,00:37:27.870,00:37:29.620,It is because he cares about you
00:37:28.620,00:37:30.820,他才会让你嫁于他放心信任的人,00:37:29.620,00:37:32.480,"that he wants you to be married
to someone he trusts."
00:37:32.330,00:37:34.410,何况你与阿晋一向谈得来,00:37:33.330,00:37:35.676,You and Ajin have always gotten along well.
00:37:35.420,00:37:36.910,难怪王爷错了主意,00:37:36.420,00:37:38.354,No wonder His Lordship had that idea.
00:37:37.670,00:37:38.330,可是,00:37:38.670,00:37:39.641,But ...
00:37:40.300,00:37:43.380,小姐和王爷也是一向谈得来的,00:37:41.300,00:37:44.380,You and His Lordship get along well too.
00:37:45.720,00:37:47.130,所以你就疑心王爷,,,
00:37:47.470,00:37:50.210,是要借你的婚事接近我是吗,00:37:46.720,00:37:51.520,"So you suspect that His Lordship is trying
to get close to me using your marriage?"
00:37:56.310,00:37:59.430,我就是觉得王爷对小姐太好了,00:37:57.310,00:38:00.430,I just think His Lordship treats you too kindly.
00:38:00.610,00:38:02.640,还千里迢迢给小姐送来家书,00:38:01.610,00:38:04.266,"He even traveled thousands of miles to
bring you a letter from our family."
00:38:04.820,00:38:06.480,那温实初是如何待我的,00:38:05.820,00:38:07.862,"How does Wen Shichu treat me,"
00:38:07.860,00:38:09.020,我又是如何待他的,00:38:08.572,00:38:10.000,and I him?
00:38:09.620,00:38:11.700,温大人待小姐从来就是很好的,00:38:10.620,00:38:12.700,Dr. Wen always treats you well
00:38:12.450,00:38:13.940,小姐也很会拿捏分寸,00:38:13.139,00:38:15.240,and you never overstep the bounds of propriety.
00:38:15.540,00:38:17.570,其实来了甘露寺以后,00:38:16.540,00:38:19.120,"Actually, since we came to the Temple of Pure Dew,"
00:38:18.210,00:38:19.320,浣碧一直就想,,,
00:38:19.580,00:38:21.120,小姐能有一个终身依靠,00:38:19.210,00:38:22.200,"I've been thinking that you should
find someone to rely on for life."
00:38:21.920,00:38:25.500,当然王爷的品性相貌气度学识,00:38:22.920,00:38:24.000,"Of course,"
00:38:26.010,00:38:27.500,样样皆在温大人之上,00:38:24.000,00:38:28.600,"His Lordship surpasses Dr. Wen in his
character, appearance, demeanor, and erudition."
00:38:28.550,00:38:31.920,可是王爷是皇上的亲弟弟呀,00:38:29.550,00:38:32.920,But His Lordship is the younger brother of His Majesty.
00:38:32.560,00:38:34.760,我何尝不知道他是皇上的亲弟弟,00:38:33.560,00:38:35.938,"You think I don't know that he's
His Majesty's younger brother?"
00:38:36.350,00:38:39.390,何况我对他也没有别的心思,00:38:37.350,00:38:40.390,"Besides, I don't have feelings for him."
00:38:41.360,00:38:43.770,我知道今日的话伤了小姐的心,00:38:42.360,00:38:44.948,I know what I said earlier upsets you.
00:38:44.730,00:38:48.020,可是纵然小姐没有对王爷的心思,00:38:45.730,00:38:49.020,"But even if you don't have feelings for His Lordship,"
00:38:48.450,00:38:50.650,难道王爷也没有对小姐的心思吗,00:38:49.450,00:38:51.828,does he not have feelings for you?
00:38:51.660,00:38:52.520,有些事情,00:38:52.394,00:38:53.780,There are some things
00:38:52.780,00:38:54.620,我们还是应当早点留心才是,00:38:53.780,00:38:55.931,that we need to be aware of in advance.
00:38:55.700,00:38:57.790,咱们经不起了是不是,00:38:56.700,00:38:58.968,"We can’t afford any more trouble, can we?"
00:39:00.000,00:39:01.280,王爷待我是知己,00:39:01.000,00:39:02.800,"His Lordship sees me as his confidant,"
00:39:01.840,00:39:03.040,我也待他是知己,00:39:02.840,00:39:04.306,and I view him the same way.
00:39:04.960,00:39:07.300,自然我会留意分寸的,00:39:05.960,00:39:08.478,"I will certainly mind appropriate boundaries,"
00:39:08.680,00:39:10.340,绝不再招惹杀身之祸,00:39:09.734,00:39:11.840,and avoid bringing disaster upon myself.
00:39:16.600,00:39:18.590,一到夏天我就心慌,00:39:17.600,00:39:20.000,I’ve been restless ever since summer began.
00:39:19.060,00:39:21.520,想着夏天过去就是秋天了,00:39:20.060,00:39:22.520,Soon it will be another autumn.
00:39:22.440,00:39:24.900,嬛儿的事好像又在眼前,00:39:23.440,00:39:26.566,"It feels as though I'll have to go through
what happened to Huan'er all over again."
00:39:25.940,00:39:27.930,我眼睁睁地看着她受苦,,,
00:39:28.190,00:39:29.600,却一点法子也没有,00:39:26.940,00:39:30.532,I could do nothing but witness her suffering.
00:39:30.530,00:39:34.690,以前是这样以后也还是这样,00:39:31.530,00:39:35.690,"It was like that then and it will be now, and always."
00:39:36.660,00:39:37.900,嬛儿在外一切都好,00:39:37.660,00:39:39.255,All is well with Huan'er.
00:39:38.450,00:39:40.410,贵人您放心吧,00:39:39.450,00:39:41.410,"Please be at ease, My Lady."
00:39:42.210,00:39:43.370,每每都说好,00:39:43.210,00:39:44.769,You’re always telling me she’s fine.
00:39:43.960,00:39:46.290,其实我知道她并不好,00:39:44.960,00:39:47.290,I know that’s not really the truth.
00:39:47.090,00:39:48.700,不过是你安慰我罢了,00:39:48.090,00:39:50.222,You're just trying to comfort me.
00:39:50.630,00:39:51.420,我也知道,00:39:51.630,00:39:52.840,I also know that
00:39:51.970,00:39:55.630,你见她不好心里会更难过,00:39:52.970,00:39:56.630,"You would be even sadder than I am
if you were to see her living unhappily."
00:39:56.600,00:39:57.880,贵人独居碎玉轩,00:39:57.600,00:39:59.324,"Living alone in the Palace of Pearl Jade,"
00:39:58.520,00:40:01.010,日夜挂心也是难受的,00:39:59.324,00:40:02.010,"you also suffer from worrying
about her day and night, My Lady."
00:40:01.310,00:40:02.300,虽然是独居,00:40:02.010,00:40:03.478,I might be living alone.
00:40:03.060,00:40:05.270,可是有你常来关照我身体,00:40:04.060,00:40:06.670,"But with you frequently coming
to care for my health,"
00:40:05.980,00:40:08.020,我也不算如置冷宫啊,00:40:06.980,00:40:09.509,it's hardly as though I'm living in the Cold Palace.
00:40:08.940,00:40:09.850,其实贵人您,00:40:09.940,00:40:10.920,"My Lady,"
00:40:10.190,00:40:11.860,大可不必搬到碎玉轩来,00:40:11.072,00:40:13.000,you didn’t have to move into the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:40:12.660,00:40:13.860,自从贵人搬过来,00:40:13.660,00:40:14.920,"Since you moved here,"
00:40:14.370,00:40:15.730,皇上就不再召见您了,00:40:15.370,00:40:17.040,His Majesty hasn't called for you.
00:40:16.700,00:40:17.910,您这又是何苦呢,00:40:17.700,00:40:19.265,Why are you putting yourself through this?
00:40:18.660,00:40:20.740,皇上过不了心里那道坎,00:40:19.660,00:40:22.040,"As long as His Majesty can't get over
the block in his heart"
00:40:21.040,00:40:22.870,就永远也不会进碎玉轩,00:40:22.040,00:40:24.358,he won't be able to step into the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:40:25.460,00:40:28.040,你知道我是为什么,00:40:26.460,00:40:29.173,You know why I am doing this.
00:40:33.300,00:40:35.540,昨日采月来告诉微臣,00:40:34.300,00:40:36.540,Yesterday Lunar came to tell me that
00:40:35.930,00:40:38.420,说娘娘日夜都会咳嗽,00:40:36.930,00:40:39.420,"you cough frequently, My Lady."
00:40:38.770,00:40:41.720,微臣煲了冰糖枇杷来,00:40:39.770,00:40:42.720,So I stewed loquat with rock sugar.
00:40:42.190,00:40:43.140,请小主服下吧,00:40:43.190,00:40:44.451,Please have some.
00:40:44.810,00:40:46.850,医病也不能医心,00:40:45.810,00:40:47.983,"Even if it can heal sickness, it can't heal the heart."
00:40:49.780,00:40:50.730,微臣告退,00:40:50.780,00:40:52.040,I shall take my leave.
00:41:09.050,00:41:09.370,娘子,,,
00:41:09.550,00:41:10.200,阿晋,00:41:10.050,00:41:11.198,"- Mistress.
- Ajin."
00:41:10.420,00:41:12.710,今儿是端午 王爷啊在宫里饮宴,00:41:11.198,00:41:13.754,"Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
His Lordship is at the imperial banquet."
00:41:13.090,00:41:15.300,叫奴才送些甜粽来给娘子过节,00:41:14.090,00:41:16.566,"He asked me to send you some
sweet rice dumplings for the festival."
00:41:16.010,00:41:16.800,有劳惦记,00:41:17.010,00:41:18.422,Thank you for thinking of us.
00:41:18.220,00:41:20.430,王爷说这几日啊宫里事多,00:41:19.220,00:41:21.720,"His Lordship said that he's been busy
at the palace for the past few days,"
00:41:20.720,00:41:22.300,待闲些日子便来看娘子,00:41:21.720,00:41:23.655,and that he will visit you when he has time.
00:41:23.640,00:41:25.800,王爷本就忙不来也是寻常,00:41:24.640,00:41:27.040,"His Lordship is often busy.
It's only natural that he's not able to visit."
00:41:27.150,00:41:28.390,也不是王爷事忙,00:41:28.150,00:41:29.820,"It's not that His Lordship is busy himself,"
00:41:28.820,00:41:30.850,是太后啊要给王爷定亲了,00:41:29.820,00:41:31.944,"but that the Empress Dowager is trying
to arrange a marriage for him."
00:41:31.780,00:41:32.390,当真吗,,,
00:41:33.150,00:41:33.810,当然了,00:41:32.780,00:41:33.701,Really?
00:41:34.070,00:41:35.900,要不然王爷怎么会不痛快,00:41:34.150,00:41:35.070,Of course.
00:41:36.610,00:41:38.320,这些年太后催得紧,00:41:35.070,00:41:37.033,"Otherwise, why would His Lordship be unhappy?"
00:41:38.870,00:41:39.570,说哪有王爷,00:41:37.610,00:41:39.631,"Her Majesty has been urging him all these years,"
00:41:39.830,00:41:41.440,到了这个年纪不娶福晋的,00:41:39.870,00:41:42.520,"saying, ""how could a lord not have a wife at this age,"""
00:41:41.740,00:41:42.730,连个妾侍都没有,00:41:42.720,00:41:44.154," not even a concubine?"""
00:41:43.580,00:41:46.040,这回安排的是沛国公家的小姐,00:41:44.580,00:41:47.710,"This time Her Majesty has set him up
with the daughter of Duke of Pei,"
00:41:46.710,00:41:49.120,叫什么孟静娴的,00:41:47.710,00:41:50.120,called Meng Jingxian or something.
00:41:49.420,00:41:50.200,这是好事,00:41:50.420,00:41:51.600,That’s good news.
00:41:51.000,00:41:52.740,王爷的年纪若换了旁人,00:41:52.000,00:41:53.207,"At His Lordship’s age,"
00:41:53.050,00:41:54.040,早就儿女成群了,00:41:53.207,00:41:55.120,many others are already crowded with children.
00:41:54.510,00:41:57.120,也是时候该找位福晋主持家政了,00:41:55.510,00:41:58.298,"It’s time to have a wife to
take charge of domestic affairs."
00:41:57.470,00:41:58.630,我们王爷正为这事,,,
00:41:58.970,00:41:59.880,满肚子不乐意呢,00:41:58.516,00:42:00.880,But His Lordship is reluctant to marry.
00:42:00.810,00:42:03.300,我以为王爷待娘子是知己,00:42:01.810,00:42:04.360,"I thought that since His Lordship
regarded you as his confidant, Mistress,"
00:42:03.730,00:42:06.060,娘子也必定十分懂得王爷的心思,00:42:04.730,00:42:07.060,you must understand his heart too.
00:42:06.520,00:42:07.130,却不想,00:42:07.520,00:42:08.400,I didn't expect
00:42:07.400,00:42:09.260,娘子说出贺喜王爷的这番话来,00:42:08.400,00:42:10.393,that you would feel happy for him.
00:42:09.770,00:42:11.640,阿晋不爱听 先告辞一步,00:42:10.770,00:42:12.729,I don't want to hear that. I'll take my leave.

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
