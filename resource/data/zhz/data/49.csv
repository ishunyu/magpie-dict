00:02:22.220,00:02:23.300,王爷每次出门,,,
00:02:23.970,00:02:25.840,都会把长相守携带在身吗,00:02:23.320,00:02:26.840,"Do you always carry Endless Promise
on you when you go out?"
00:02:26.390,00:02:27.880,每次来这边才会带上,00:02:27.490,00:02:28.980,Only when I come here.
00:02:28.230,00:02:30.590,王爷对太妃果然深有孝心,00:02:29.330,00:02:31.690,Your Lordship is very filial to Her Venerable Highness.
00:02:32.400,00:02:34.100,因为长相思在你这里,00:02:33.500,00:02:35.200,You have Endless Longing with you.
00:02:34.940,00:02:36.180,我是长相守的主人,00:02:36.040,00:02:37.280,"I'm Endless Promise's owner,"
00:02:36.860,00:02:38.150,来寻长相思的主人,00:02:37.960,00:02:39.250,on my way to see Endless Longing's owner.
00:02:39.360,00:02:40.650,王爷真会开玩笑,00:02:40.460,00:02:42.109,Your Lordship is good at making jokes.
00:02:42.120,00:02:44.400,嬛儿 我不是和你开玩笑,00:02:43.220,00:02:45.500,"I'm not joking with you, Huan'er."
00:02:45.990,00:02:48.910,可我只能当您是玩笑,00:02:47.090,00:02:50.010,But I can only treat this as a joke.
00:02:51.500,00:02:52.790,从前你是皇上的女人,00:02:52.600,00:02:54.080,You were a concubine of the emperor before.
00:02:53.790,00:02:55.080,现在已是自由之身,00:02:54.890,00:02:56.180,But you are free now.
00:02:56.380,00:02:59.210,所以我说的不是和你玩笑,00:02:57.480,00:03:00.310,So I wasn't joking with you.
00:03:01.590,00:03:02.330,是真心话,00:03:02.448,00:03:03.600,It's my true feelings.
00:03:04.100,00:03:05.180,你离开清凉台,00:03:05.200,00:03:06.440,"After you left the Cooling Terrace,"
00:03:06.220,00:03:08.210,我怕你伤心为难,00:03:07.320,00:03:09.310,I restrained myself from visiting you
00:03:08.810,00:03:09.920,忍耐着不去找你,00:03:09.310,00:03:11.542,"because I feared that you would be hurt, or uneasy."
00:03:10.980,00:03:12.510,可你知道我心里有多难过,00:03:12.080,00:03:13.610,But do you know how sad I was?
00:03:15.360,00:03:17.310,芭蕉不解丁香结,00:03:16.460,00:03:19.082,"""Banana leaves furled;
the budding lilac not bloomed."""
00:03:18.530,00:03:20.810,同向春风各自愁,00:03:19.630,00:03:21.910,"""They stand in the spring wind
but face their own sorrows."""
00:03:23.490,00:03:26.610,我不知道你是否和我一样,00:03:24.590,00:03:27.710,I don't know if you feel the same as I do.
00:03:28.080,00:03:29.160,可是这个春天,00:03:29.180,00:03:30.577,But I'm afraid
00:03:30.710,00:03:34.160,怕是我有生以来最难挨的春天了,00:03:31.698,00:03:35.260,"that this has been the hardest spring
to get through of my entire life."
00:03:36.090,00:03:37.580,我从前是宫中的宠妃,00:03:37.190,00:03:38.949,I was a favored concubine in the palace.
00:03:39.920,00:03:42.340,现在甘露寺我是带发修行,00:03:41.020,00:03:43.440,"Now I'm practicing Buddhism in
the Temple of Pure Dew,"
00:03:42.800,00:03:44.260,和宫廷已经毫无干系了,00:03:43.900,00:03:45.869,and have nothing to do with the palace anymore.
00:03:46.140,00:03:47.090,人非草木,00:03:46.971,00:03:48.784,But I‘m not an emotionless stalk of grass.
00:03:48.350,00:03:50.090,王爷的心思我并非不知道,00:03:49.450,00:03:51.460,I'm not unaware of how Your Lordship feels.
00:03:51.810,00:03:53.970,只是我这从宫里出来的残躯,00:03:52.910,00:03:55.249,"But in my declining years out of the palace,"
00:03:54.980,00:03:57.390,再也不想和皇室贵胄再有沾染,,,
00:03:57.980,00:03:58.810,纠缠不清,00:03:56.080,00:03:59.910,"I don't want any more attachment
with the imperial descendants."
00:03:59.070,00:04:00.650,因为你曾经是皇兄的宠妃,00:04:00.170,00:04:01.885,You are unable to accept me
00:04:01.070,00:04:02.230,而我也出身宫廷,00:04:01.885,00:04:04.050,"because you used to be
His Majesty's concubine,"
00:04:02.950,00:04:05.650,所以你不愿接受我,00:04:04.050,00:04:06.750,and because I was born into the imperial family.
00:04:07.530,00:04:08.650,可是当年在宫里面,,,
00:04:09.660,00:04:11.530,你可曾有一日过得平安快乐,00:04:08.630,00:04:10.513,"But when you were in the palace,"
00:04:12.460,00:04:13.450,我遇见你的每一次,00:04:10.760,00:04:13.079,did you ever have a day of peace and happiness?
00:04:14.250,00:04:15.710,你何曾真正地开心过,00:04:13.560,00:04:15.350,"Of all our encounters in the palace,"
,,,00:04:15.350,00:04:17.303,was there ever a time that you were truly happy?
00:04:16.460,00:04:19.250,没有连哭也要极力地忍着,00:04:17.560,00:04:20.574,There wasn't! Even your tears had to be restrained.
00:04:21.300,00:04:22.960,即便没有宫里那段日子,00:04:22.400,00:04:24.733,"Even if I never had to have lived in the palace,"
00:04:23.970,00:04:26.750,过去和如今到底也不一样了,00:04:25.070,00:04:28.074,the past is different from the present after all.
00:04:27.970,00:04:29.380,无论是过去还是现在,,,
00:04:29.850,00:04:31.010,撇开宫里那些日子,00:04:29.070,00:04:30.659,"Whether it's now or before,"
00:04:31.350,00:04:32.300,你都是自由之身,00:04:30.659,00:04:32.450,"putting aside your time in the palace,"
00:04:32.600,00:04:33.810,可以和任何人在一起,00:04:32.450,00:04:33.700,you've always been free.
,,,00:04:33.700,00:04:35.179,You can be together with anyone you want.
00:04:35.940,00:04:39.400,你方才说人非草木,00:04:37.040,00:04:38.466,You just said
00:04:40.650,00:04:41.980,那么孰能无情,00:04:39.408,00:04:41.307,that you aren't a stalk of grass.
,,,00:04:41.750,00:04:43.484,You are not emotionless.
00:04:43.900,00:04:44.810,在你心里,00:04:45.000,00:04:46.240,"In some part of your heart,"
00:04:46.160,00:04:47.400,你也是有一点点,00:04:47.260,00:04:48.818,you like me
00:04:49.120,00:04:51.110,喜欢我的 对吗,00:04:50.208,00:04:52.210,"at least a little bit, am I right?"
00:04:52.000,00:04:52.830,就像那一天,,,
00:04:53.750,00:04:54.910,你曾经叫我的名字,00:04:53.100,00:04:54.400,I remember that day
00:04:56.420,00:04:57.950,王爷可曾与女子相爱过,00:04:54.850,00:04:56.324,you called me by my name.
00:05:00.340,00:05:01.080,没有,00:04:57.520,00:04:59.400,Has Your Lordship ever been in love?
00:05:01.880,00:05:02.920,可我经历过,00:05:01.440,00:05:02.584,"No, I haven't."
00:05:03.840,00:05:04.700,所以明白,00:05:02.980,00:05:04.360,I have experienced it.
00:05:06.430,00:05:08.380,有些事如果一开始,00:05:04.940,00:05:06.000,So I understand
00:05:08.720,00:05:09.840,就明知道不能善终,00:05:07.530,00:05:11.254,"that if you know from the beginning
that something will not end well,"
00:05:10.930,00:05:12.420,就不要去痴心妄想,,,
00:05:12.810,00:05:14.220,去勉强求一个善果,00:05:12.030,00:05:15.320,"it's better to avoid wishful thinking
and trying to force a good result."
00:05:16.230,00:05:17.810,就好比从前我与皇上,00:05:17.330,00:05:19.089,Just like His Majesty and me.
00:05:19.310,00:05:19.850,如果一开始,,,
00:05:20.150,00:05:21.930,我就以一般嫔妃之心待他,00:05:20.410,00:05:22.925,"If from the very beginning,
I treated him like other concubines did,"
00:05:23.030,00:05:25.730,只求荣华富贵 不求一丝真情,00:05:24.130,00:05:27.188,"only seeking opulence and glory,
and never a shred of true love,"
00:05:26.780,00:05:28.240,那如今连累我父亲的人,,,
00:05:28.660,00:05:29.570,就不是我了,00:05:27.880,00:05:29.760,then I wouldn't be the one who
,,,00:05:29.760,00:05:30.939,implicated my father.
00:05:32.660,00:05:33.990,你只伤心了一次,00:05:33.760,00:05:35.225,Your heart has only been hurt once.
00:05:34.750,00:05:36.740,便要对世间的情字都失望吗,00:05:35.850,00:05:37.840,Are you going to give up on love because of that?
00:05:38.330,00:05:39.820,既然知道以后要伤心,00:05:39.430,00:05:41.462,"Given that I know I'll only get hurt,"
00:05:41.290,00:05:43.210,那我就情愿从来没有认识过他,00:05:41.986,00:05:44.310,I would rather never have to know him
00:05:43.920,00:05:44.830,也不要遇见他,00:05:45.020,00:05:46.154,or meet him.
00:05:48.890,00:05:49.590,如果,00:05:49.990,00:05:50.690,If...
00:05:51.180,00:05:52.920,有人一心一意待你,00:05:52.280,00:05:54.155,there was someone who would dedicate himself
00:05:53.930,00:05:55.300,想给你四时明媚,,,
00:05:55.730,00:05:56.760,为你遮风蔽雨,00:05:54.851,00:05:56.830,to create an endless springtime in your life
00:05:58.230,00:05:59.010,你也不原页意吗,00:05:56.830,00:05:58.623,and shelter you from the snow and rain.
00:06:03.730,00:06:04.720,碧玉小家女,00:05:59.330,00:06:00.880,Would you still refuse him?
00:06:05.650,00:06:06.690,不敢攀贵德,00:06:04.507,00:06:06.548,"""This young lady from a humble family"""
,,,00:06:06.548,00:06:08.382,"""has no intention to attach herself to royalty."""
00:06:08.240,00:06:09.400,往事既已成梦,00:06:09.017,00:06:10.880,"The past has now become a dream,"
00:06:10.740,00:06:13.320,将来之事也是一眼望得到底的,00:06:11.840,00:06:14.913,"and I can see my future as clearly
 as the bottom of a lake."
00:06:14.040,00:06:15.900,就不必再有任何做梦之事,00:06:15.140,00:06:17.494,So there's nothing for me to dream for any longer.
00:06:17.960,00:06:18.950,王爷曾说过,00:06:19.060,00:06:20.600,Your Lordship once said
00:06:19.500,00:06:21.790,沛国公家的小姐虽然德行出众,00:06:20.600,00:06:22.890,that you don't like the Duke of Pei's daughter
00:06:22.500,00:06:23.990,但是王爷却偏偏不喜欢,00:06:23.600,00:06:25.807,despite her outstanding virtue and manners.
00:06:25.630,00:06:27.210,那我对王爷亦是如此,00:06:26.407,00:06:28.699,I feel the same about Your Lordship.
00:06:28.720,00:06:31.930,王爷虽然贵为天家之子,00:06:29.457,00:06:33.240,"Although Your Lordship is from
the imperial family,"
00:06:32.510,00:06:33.470,近宗亲王,00:06:33.464,00:06:35.282,"and closely related to the emperor,"
00:06:34.430,00:06:36.970,可我甄嬛也偏偏不喜欢,00:06:35.506,00:06:38.172,Your Lordship happens not to be to my liking.
00:07:06.000,00:07:07.490,自打这次从清凉台回来,,,
00:07:07.960,00:07:09.200,娘子便不怎么笑了,00:07:06.647,00:07:10.206,"Our mistress hasn't smiled much since
she came back from the Cooling Terrace."
00:07:09.510,00:07:10.340,可是怎么了,00:07:10.404,00:07:11.680,What could be the matter?
00:07:11.260,00:07:12.040,没什么,00:07:12.230,00:07:13.234,Nothing.
00:07:16.510,00:07:18.000,可是娘子这样不说话,00:07:17.238,00:07:19.087,But she's been so quiet.
00:07:19.850,00:07:21.340,要不是温太医前几日送来的,,,
00:07:21.690,00:07:23.300,这几只相思雀来逗趣,00:07:20.443,00:07:24.518,"If it weren't for these birds Dr. Wen sent
a few days ago to lighten her mood,"
00:07:24.150,00:07:25.640,这娘子怕是要更闷了,00:07:24.918,00:07:26.955,she might be even more reserved.
00:07:50.090,00:07:51.170,怎么这么吵啊,00:07:51.181,00:07:52.530,What's that noise?
00:07:54.840,00:07:55.580,怎么了,,,
00:07:57.310,00:07:57.920,有猫,00:07:56.214,00:07:57.313,What is it?
00:07:59.220,00:08:00.760,槿汐赶紧去打猫,00:07:59.410,00:08:00.469,Cats!
00:08:01.350,00:08:02.930,小姐被猫伤过 见不得猫的,00:08:00.715,00:08:02.300,"Jinxi, beat the cats away!"
,,,00:08:02.683,00:08:04.487,"My Lady has been hurt by a cat before,
she's terrified of them!"
00:08:22.710,00:08:23.410,小姐,00:08:23.913,00:08:25.023,My Lady.
00:08:26.840,00:08:28.080,没事了 嬛儿 嬛儿,00:08:27.649,00:08:29.209,It's all right. Huan'er. Huan'er.
00:08:28.710,00:08:29.620,嬛儿没事了,,,
00:08:30.090,00:08:31.040,猫都被我赶出去了,00:08:29.801,00:08:30.711,"Huan'er, it's safe here."
,,,00:08:31.221,00:08:32.499,I chased the cats out.
00:08:32.920,00:08:33.660,王爷,00:08:33.890,00:08:34.809,Your Lordship...
00:08:42.390,00:08:43.970,是什么猫这么大啊,00:08:43.521,00:08:45.400,What kind of cats are so big?
00:08:44.690,00:08:45.390,山里野猫,,,
00:08:46.230,00:08:46.930,山野里,00:08:45.639,00:08:47.037,Wild mountain cats.
00:08:49.520,00:08:50.390,怎么能养鸟呢,00:08:47.306,00:08:48.482,Why would you
00:08:51.610,00:08:52.770,这里虽然没有大的猛兽,00:08:50.000,00:08:52.412,keep pet birds when you live in the mountains?
00:08:53.070,00:08:53.850,可是野猫却很多,00:08:52.412,00:08:54.237,"There might not be huge beasts here,"
00:08:54.240,00:08:55.190,最爱以鸟为食,,,
00:08:56.240,00:08:57.850,还好没有人受伤,00:08:54.237,00:08:56.991,"but there're plenty of wild cats, which feed on birds."
00:08:58.700,00:08:59.690,都是那个温大人,00:08:57.400,00:08:59.324,"Fortunately, no one got hurt."
00:09:00.290,00:09:01.820,好端端地拿什么鸟来,00:08:59.860,00:09:01.164,Dr. Wen is to blame.
00:09:02.450,00:09:03.490,说是逗小姐乐,,,
00:09:04.040,00:09:05.200,却把野猫给招来了,00:09:01.450,00:09:06.360,"He sent those birds to cheer up My Lady,
but ended up attracting wild cats."
00:09:07.380,00:09:08.290,多谢王爷,,,
00:09:08.960,00:09:10.170,要不是王爷相救,00:09:08.209,00:09:09.805,I thank Your Lordship.
00:09:10.710,00:09:12.370,刚才真不知道会怎么样呢,00:09:10.000,00:09:11.520,"If it weren't for your help,"
00:09:13.380,00:09:14.620,真把奴婢吓坏了,00:09:11.870,00:09:13.760,I really don't know what would have happened.
00:09:15.760,00:09:17.250,从来没见过那么大的猫,00:09:14.540,00:09:15.959,I was so frightened.
00:09:17.840,00:09:19.330,说起来真的是温大人,00:09:16.920,00:09:18.679,I have never seen such big cats.
00:09:19.720,00:09:21.090,好心办了坏事情,00:09:19.000,00:09:20.625,It really was because of Dr. Wen.
,,,00:09:20.880,00:09:22.654,His good intentions led to bad results.
00:09:23.020,00:09:24.630,今晚的事多谢王爷,00:09:24.180,00:09:26.014,I'm grateful for Your Lordship's help.
00:09:25.980,00:09:27.220,只是这么晚了,00:09:27.140,00:09:29.087,But why is Your Lordship
00:09:27.940,00:09:30.300,王爷怎么还会在这儿附近呢,00:09:29.087,00:09:31.440,around here so late at night?
00:09:31.820,00:09:34.060,这些天来你都到二更天才睡,00:09:32.980,00:09:35.220,These days you stay up until nearly midnight.
00:09:34.860,00:09:36.350,难怪脸色这样憔悴,,,
00:09:37.280,00:09:38.240,你都在这儿,00:09:36.020,00:09:37.824,No wonder you look so haggard.
00:09:38.620,00:09:39.950,我只想等你睡了再走,00:09:38.216,00:09:39.600,You've been here all this time?
00:09:41.950,00:09:43.360,可今日我已经睡下了,00:09:39.780,00:09:41.379,I just wanted to wait until you were asleep.
00:09:44.200,00:09:45.190,你怎么还在这儿呢,00:09:43.110,00:09:46.320,"But I was already asleep.
Why were you still here?"
00:09:46.710,00:09:47.450,嬛儿,00:09:47.870,00:09:48.832,"Huan'er,"
00:09:48.460,00:09:50.290,你就当我是贪看月色好了,,,
00:09:50.960,00:09:51.820,今天都怪我,00:09:49.460,00:09:52.120,"you can think of it as me
being attracted by the moonlight."
00:09:52.420,00:09:53.580,一不留神打了个盹,00:09:52.120,00:09:55.120,"It's all my fault for not coming sooner.
I fell into a slumber."
00:09:53.960,00:09:54.830,让你受惊了,00:09:55.120,00:09:56.528,I'm sorry that you had a scare.
00:09:59.680,00:10:00.960,你是千金之体,,,
00:10:02.260,00:10:03.630,何必要这样为难自己,00:10:00.840,00:10:04.800,"Your Lordship is as distinguished as gold.
Why would you trouble yourself like this?"
00:10:04.020,00:10:04.880,何来为难,00:10:05.180,00:10:06.398,This is not trouble.
00:10:05.890,00:10:08.050,只要在外面能看到你屋里的灯光,00:10:07.050,00:10:09.730,"It brings peace to my mind
so long as I can be outside"
00:10:08.940,00:10:10.390,心里便总觉得安慰些,00:10:10.000,00:10:12.320,and see the light coming from your quarters.
00:10:13.900,00:10:15.140,王爷快回去睡吧,00:10:15.060,00:10:16.659,"Your Lordship, please go back and sleep."
00:10:16.110,00:10:17.190,已经三更天了,00:10:17.270,00:10:18.529,It's around midnight already.
00:10:18.360,00:10:20.270,你放心地睡吧 我,00:10:19.296,00:10:20.877,Please go to sleep with your mind at ease.
,,,00:10:20.877,00:10:21.430,I...
00:10:23.030,00:10:23.770,告辞了,00:10:24.190,00:10:25.423,I will take my leave.
00:10:49.690,00:10:52.600,娘娘 昨夜又是祺嫔侍寝,00:10:50.850,00:10:53.760,"Your Highness, Concubine Délice
served His Majesty again last night."
00:10:55.020,00:10:57.980,祺嫔有家世 皇后又抬举她,00:10:56.180,00:10:59.275,"She has a good family background
and Her Majesty thinks highly of her."
00:10:58.490,00:10:59.730,她自然得宠些,,,
00:11:00.320,00:11:01.980,可祺嫔话多讨嫌,00:10:59.650,00:11:01.440,"It's only natural that she gains
more of His Majesty's favor."
00:11:02.490,00:11:03.570,总不放过娘娘,00:11:01.480,00:11:03.455,She talks excessively and is unpleasant.
00:11:04.030,00:11:04.820,真是讨厌,00:11:03.650,00:11:05.190,And she never lets up on Your Highness.
00:11:05.120,00:11:06.650,她仗着家里有功劳,00:11:05.190,00:11:06.280,She's so annoying.
00:11:07.040,00:11:08.280,就这么瞧不起我,00:11:06.280,00:11:09.601,"She looks down upon me because of
her family's contributions."
00:11:09.370,00:11:11.410,可这宫里的宠爱和位分,,,
00:11:12.250,00:11:13.960,哪里是靠家世决定的,00:11:10.530,00:11:15.320,"But, favor and status in the palace
are decided by family background."
00:11:14.420,00:11:15.250,可不是吗,,,
00:11:15.710,00:11:16.790,奴婢都看得出,00:11:15.580,00:11:16.870,They aren't.
00:11:17.090,00:11:18.580,皇上还是喜欢娘娘的,00:11:16.870,00:11:19.720,"Even I can see that His Majesty
likes Your Highness more."
00:11:19.380,00:11:20.590,喜欢又有什么用,00:11:20.540,00:11:22.184,What's the point of being liked?
00:11:21.510,00:11:23.090,得宠才是最重要的,00:11:22.670,00:11:24.654,Gaining favor is the most important.
00:11:29.100,00:11:31.720,对了 上次的香料用完了,00:11:30.260,00:11:32.880,"Also, the spice from last time has run out."
00:11:32.020,00:11:33.760,父亲托人从家里送来了吗,,,
00:11:34.060,00:11:35.430,奴婢已经传话出去,00:11:33.180,00:11:35.010,Has my father had more sent here?
00:11:35.690,00:11:36.770,应该很快就到了,00:11:35.220,00:11:36.850,I've passed on the message.
00:11:37.150,00:11:37.940,那就好,00:11:36.850,00:11:38.080,They should arrive soon.
,,,00:11:38.310,00:11:39.360,Good.
00:11:39.530,00:11:41.480,可惜我现在还不能怀孩子,00:11:40.690,00:11:42.960,"It's a shame that I am still
not able to have a child."
00:11:42.110,00:11:44.150,皇后不喜欢后宫生下孩子,00:11:43.270,00:11:45.489,"Her Majesty doesn't like more children
to be born in the harem."
00:11:44.620,00:11:45.650,我依附皇后,00:11:45.780,00:11:47.440,"I'm relying on her,"
00:11:46.450,00:11:49.440,除了唯命是从 还有什么法子呢,00:11:47.610,00:11:50.600,so I have no choice but to obey her orders.
00:11:50.120,00:11:50.860,是,00:11:51.280,00:11:52.200,Yes.
00:11:51.620,00:11:53.240,还有就是菊青那丫头,00:11:52.780,00:11:54.400,"About Daisy, the maid."
00:11:53.710,00:11:56.040,到底不是一直跟在娘娘身边的人,00:11:54.870,00:11:57.335,"She hasn't been serving
Your Highness all along after all."
00:11:56.590,00:11:59.170,既然不中用了 就别留了吧,00:11:57.600,00:12:00.440,"Since she is of no use,
we don't need to keep her any longer."
00:11:59.590,00:12:02.380,娘娘 皇上这会子刚下朝,00:12:00.750,00:12:03.630,"Your Highness, His Majesty just
dismissed the morning court."
00:12:03.090,00:12:05.210,奴婢陪您去养心殿请个安吧,00:12:04.250,00:12:06.370,How about I accompany you to pay your respects?
00:12:05.600,00:12:06.330,不去,00:12:06.760,00:12:07.490,No.
00:12:07.060,00:12:09.300,这两日皇上为处置隆科多的事情,,,
00:12:09.600,00:12:10.510,正忙着呢,00:12:08.220,00:12:11.640,"His Majesty has been busy dealing with
issues regarding Longkodo."
00:12:10.980,00:12:12.220,我还是少去为妙,00:12:12.140,00:12:13.784,It would be best to refrain from visiting.
00:12:16.980,00:12:18.600,儿子给皇额娘请安,00:12:18.140,00:12:20.000,"Peace to you, Imperial Mother."
00:12:19.900,00:12:20.690,坐吧,00:12:21.060,00:12:22.119,Have a seat.
00:12:28.410,00:12:30.820,这些日子没来寿康宫请安,00:12:29.570,00:12:32.320,I haven't been visiting the Palace of Longevity recently.
00:12:31.830,00:12:33.540,还请皇额娘不要见怪,00:12:32.990,00:12:35.050,"Please don't blame me, Imperial Mother."
00:12:34.250,00:12:35.360,前朝事多,00:12:35.410,00:12:36.789,Things are busy in the imperial court.
00:12:35.830,00:12:38.320,皇帝是该顾着前朝要紧,00:12:36.990,00:12:39.760,You're right to pay more attention to it.
00:12:39.170,00:12:42.210,这些日子前朝的事虽然多,00:12:40.330,00:12:43.370,"Although things have been busy
these days at court,"
00:12:42.550,00:12:44.710,但归根结底只有一件事,00:12:43.710,00:12:46.160,they all come down to one issue.
00:12:45.970,00:12:50.630,就是隆科多结党营私欺君罔上,00:12:47.130,00:12:51.790,"That is, that Longkodo has formed a faction
and undermined the authority of his sovereign."
00:12:53.770,00:12:55.300,皇帝除了年羹尧,00:12:54.930,00:12:56.960,"After eliminating Nian Gengyao,"
00:12:56.270,00:12:58.140,果然就轮到隆科多,00:12:57.430,00:12:59.300,"as expected, it's now Longkodo's turn."
00:12:59.020,00:13:00.180,哀家原以为,,,
00:13:00.400,00:13:02.690,隆科多晚年可以得个善终,00:13:00.180,00:13:04.019,"I thought that Longkodo could retire
peacefully in his old age."
00:13:04.400,00:13:07.190,原来皇帝还是容不下他,00:13:05.560,00:13:08.350,But you still won't make allowances for him.
00:13:07.410,00:13:09.070,不是儿子容不下隆科多,00:13:08.570,00:13:10.634,It's not that I don't make allowances for him.
00:13:09.910,00:13:11.870,而是他自己容不下他自己,00:13:11.070,00:13:13.344,It's that he doesn't make allowances for himself.
00:13:13.710,00:13:16.790,年羹尧在的时候二人勾结良多,00:13:14.870,00:13:17.950,"When Nian Gengyao was alive,
they had many strong links."
00:13:17.210,00:13:18.290,你早就知道,,,
00:13:18.500,00:13:20.330,年羹尧与隆科多不睦,00:13:18.370,00:13:21.929,"You've known for a long time that Nian Gengyao
and Longkodo never got along with each other.."
00:13:21.550,00:13:23.290,为了让他们暂保安宁,,,
00:13:23.590,00:13:24.620,维持表面和气,00:13:22.710,00:13:26.029,"To maintain harmony at a superficial level,"
00:13:25.470,00:13:26.960,皇帝还主动提出,,,
00:13:27.640,00:13:29.220,将年羹尧的长子,,,
00:13:29.510,00:13:31.380,过继给隆科多做义子,00:13:26.630,00:13:32.647,"you suggested that Longkodo should
foster Nian Gengyao's eldest son."
00:13:32.270,00:13:34.100,若说他二人勾结,,,
00:13:34.520,00:13:36.430,岂非皇帝就是主谋,00:13:33.430,00:13:37.560,"If you're saying that they colluded with each other,
doesn't that make you the chief plotter?"
00:13:36.640,00:13:38.130,隆科多罪犯滔天,00:13:37.800,00:13:39.560,Longkodo has committed heinous crimes.
00:13:39.560,00:13:41.600,即便儿子冤他一条两条的,,,
00:13:41.900,00:13:42.810,也不为过,00:13:40.720,00:13:43.960,"It wouldn't be unjust if I had made
a false accusation or two."
00:13:43.150,00:13:45.980,更何况他有十数条大罪,00:13:44.310,00:13:47.498,"In fact, he has committed more than ten serious crimes."
00:13:47.700,00:13:49.310,即便到了九泉之下,,,
00:13:49.870,00:13:51.360,阎王殿前辩驳,00:13:48.860,00:13:51.030,Even when he descends beneath the nine hells
00:13:51.870,00:13:53.360,也驳不出什么来,00:13:51.030,00:13:52.520,"and defends himself to the judge of the underworld,"
00:13:55.080,00:13:57.620,当年除年羹尧的时候,00:13:53.030,00:13:54.789,he still won't be able to justify his crimes.
00:13:58.420,00:14:00.660,皇额娘还为儿子一起布置,00:13:56.240,00:14:01.760,"Imperial Mother, you plotted with
me to eliminate Nian Gengyao."
00:14:01.500,00:14:05.250,怎么今日到了隆科多就百般庇护,00:14:02.660,00:14:06.805,"But when it comes to Longkodo,
why do you try your utmost to protect him?"
00:14:06.380,00:14:08.540,难道少年相识之情,,,
00:14:08.800,00:14:11.090,真是恩深义重吗,00:14:07.540,00:14:12.560,"Is it that you feel indebted to him because of your
acquaintance with him from a young age?"
00:14:12.680,00:14:14.760,哀家当日就跟你说过,00:14:13.840,00:14:16.095,I have said before
00:14:15.930,00:14:17.390,年羹尧与隆科多,,,
00:14:17.640,00:14:19.850,是扶持皇帝登基的重臣,00:14:16.902,00:14:19.327,that Nian Gengyao and Longkodo
00:14:21.150,00:14:22.930,既然年羹尧不可留,00:14:19.327,00:14:21.189,"provided major support for your
accession to the throne."
00:14:23.400,00:14:25.010,隆科多就不能再杀,00:14:22.310,00:14:24.560,"Since Nian Gengyao could not be tolerated,"
00:14:26.110,00:14:27.650,否则后人会说,00:14:24.560,00:14:26.529,we should not eliminate Longkodo.
00:14:28.700,00:14:31.110,狡兔死走狗烹,00:14:27.270,00:14:29.280,"Otherwise, people will say"
00:14:31.820,00:14:34.240,怨皇帝过河拆桥,00:14:29.280,00:14:32.719,"""After the cunning hare is killed,
the hound is boiled""."
00:14:34.990,00:14:36.110,哀家所言,00:14:32.948,00:14:36.066,"And they will accuse you of ""tearing down
the bridge after crossing the river."""
00:14:37.040,00:14:39.120,都是为了皇帝的声名啊,00:14:36.066,00:14:40.406,I'm only saying this to protect your reputation.
00:14:40.420,00:14:41.910,别人都可以放过,00:14:41.580,00:14:43.509,"Anyone else I could spare,"
00:14:42.540,00:14:44.780,隆科多是非死不可,00:14:43.700,00:14:46.250,but Longkodo must die.
00:14:46.800,00:14:49.410,隆科多是孝懿仁皇后的兄弟,00:14:47.960,00:14:50.570,Longkodo is the brother of Empress Xiaoyiren
00:14:49.760,00:14:51.040,你名义上的舅舅,00:14:50.920,00:14:52.824,and he is your uncle in name.
00:14:52.300,00:14:54.290,你就是不顾着隆科多,00:14:53.460,00:14:55.840,"Even if you don't account for Longkodo himself,"
00:14:55.060,00:14:57.840,也该顾及孝懿仁皇后的颜面哪,00:14:56.220,00:14:59.120,"you should at least consider
Empress Xiaoyiren's prestige."
00:14:58.060,00:15:01.270,杀隆科多不止是为儿子,00:14:59.220,00:15:02.920,"Longkodo must be killed not only for me,"
00:15:02.940,00:15:05.350,更是为了保皇额娘的声名,00:15:04.100,00:15:06.950,but to also protect your reputation.
00:15:06.980,00:15:10.440,隆科多是皇额娘青梅竹马之交,00:15:08.140,00:15:11.860,"Longkodo has had a close relationship
with you since childhood"
00:15:11.160,00:15:12.990,有两小无猜之情,00:15:12.320,00:15:14.509,and you both had affection for each other.
00:15:14.200,00:15:17.440,皇阿玛不知不代表儿子不知,00:15:15.360,00:15:18.770,"Just because Father wasn't aware
doesn't mean I also don't know."
00:15:20.830,00:15:23.290,三月初三上巳节是什么日子,00:15:21.990,00:15:24.778,What happened during the Double Third Festival?
00:15:24.420,00:15:26.830,皇额娘比儿子更清楚,00:15:25.540,00:15:28.120,I'm sure you know better than I do.
00:15:29.300,00:15:30.910,皇额娘要保全的,,,
00:15:31.760,00:15:34.090,不仅是皇阿玛的颜面,00:15:30.420,00:15:35.350,"Imperial Mother, not only do you
have to protect Father's prestige,"
00:15:34.470,00:15:35.880,更是儿子的颜面,00:15:35.630,00:15:37.040,but also mine.
00:15:36.850,00:15:38.300,皇额娘要是舍不得,,,
00:15:38.980,00:15:39.810,那便是舍得了,00:15:38.010,00:15:40.000,"If you can't bear to see him die,"
00:15:40.060,00:15:42.350,儿子千辛万苦得来的皇位,00:15:40.140,00:15:43.774,then it means you would rather imperil the throne I strove hard for
00:15:43.020,00:15:45.010,和皇额娘的太后之尊,00:15:44.270,00:15:46.874,and your honored status as Empress Dowager.
00:15:52.200,00:15:53.280,至于隆科多,00:15:53.360,00:15:54.560,"As for Longkodo,"
00:15:54.450,00:15:56.990,儿子已经在畅春园弄了间偏房,,,
00:15:57.330,00:15:58.190,圈禁起来,00:15:55.610,00:15:59.624,"I have already confined him in a private
chamber of the Garden of Vibrant Spring."
00:15:59.410,00:16:04.370,还请皇额娘保全儿子的颜面声名,00:16:00.570,00:16:05.530,"Imperial Mother, I hope you will
protect my prestige and reputation."
00:16:11.420,00:16:12.830,站住什么人,00:16:12.580,00:16:14.295,Stop! Who are you?
00:16:15.090,00:16:16.880,我是太后身边的孙姑姑,,,
00:16:17.100,00:16:19.010,带领隆科多家人前去见一面,00:16:16.250,00:16:18.260,"I am Madam Bamboo,
maid of the Empress Dowager."
00:16:19.520,00:16:20.300,即刻出来,00:16:18.260,00:16:20.430,I'm bringing Longkodo's family to see him.
00:16:20.980,00:16:21.890,原来是孙姑姑,00:16:20.680,00:16:21.950,It won't take long.
00:16:22.230,00:16:23.340,小的有眼不识泰山,00:16:22.140,00:16:25.100,"Madam Bamboo, it was foolish of me
to not have recognized you."
00:16:23.940,00:16:24.680,您请,00:16:25.100,00:16:26.510,"Please, head on in."
00:16:33.450,00:16:35.480,您进去吧我替您守着,00:16:34.340,00:16:36.951,Please go in. I'll stay here to keep watch.
00:16:44.580,00:16:45.370,谁呀,00:16:45.740,00:16:46.970,Who are you?
00:16:49.420,00:16:50.250,是我,00:16:50.580,00:16:51.810,It's me.
00:16:51.130,00:16:54.170,奴才隆科多给太后请安,00:16:52.290,00:16:55.859,"The humble servant Longkodo
bows before Your Majesty."
00:16:55.260,00:16:56.170,快起来,00:16:56.420,00:16:57.955,Please stand up.
00:17:00.430,00:17:03.010,哀家初见你时,,,
00:17:03.730,00:17:05.220,你意气风发,00:17:01.590,00:17:06.270,"When I first met you, you were high-spirited."
00:17:06.520,00:17:09.140,如今却到这样的境地,00:17:07.680,00:17:10.560,"But now, it has come to this."
00:17:11.440,00:17:12.730,全怪我,00:17:12.600,00:17:14.080,It's all my fault.
00:17:14.860,00:17:16.270,是奴才之过,00:17:16.020,00:17:17.740,"No, it is my own fault."
00:17:17.620,00:17:19.860,太后万人之上,00:17:18.780,00:17:21.199,Your Majesty is esteemed above all.
00:17:20.790,00:17:23.120,还能来看奴才这样的将死之人,,,
00:17:23.410,00:17:25.200,奴才感激不尽,00:17:21.950,00:17:26.740,"I'm eternally grateful that Your Majesty
would visit me, on the verge of my death."
00:17:27.380,00:17:28.960,你我相交多年,,,
00:17:29.210,00:17:30.830,我来看你也是应当的,00:17:28.540,00:17:30.370,We have known each other for many years.
,,,00:17:30.370,00:17:32.340,I felt obliged to visit you.
00:17:33.050,00:17:36.880,这地方湿寒你的腿受得了吗,00:17:34.210,00:17:38.040,"It is cold and damp here.
Has your leg been all right?"
00:17:37.970,00:17:39.550,多谢太后挂念,00:17:39.130,00:17:40.760,I thank Your Majesty for asking.
00:17:39.930,00:17:42.510,奴才的腿已经好多了,00:17:41.090,00:17:43.670,My leg has improved a lot.
00:17:43.600,00:17:46.310,这里简陋不堪,,,
00:17:47.560,00:17:49.180,太后就将就坐吧,00:17:44.760,00:17:50.470,"I hope Your Majesty won't mind the
unsightly furniture. Please have a seat."
00:17:51.150,00:17:55.110,你的腿当年是为了救我才受的伤,00:17:52.310,00:17:56.270,Your leg was injured because you saved me.
00:17:56.150,00:17:57.730,我当然应该关心,00:17:57.310,00:17:59.469,Of course I am concerned about it.
00:17:59.410,00:18:00.240,你也坐,00:18:00.570,00:18:01.930,You should sit as well.
00:18:01.740,00:18:02.860,多谢太后,00:18:02.900,00:18:04.371,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:07.040,00:18:10.410,能为太后效力是奴才的福气,00:18:07.970,00:18:11.570,It is an honor to serve Your Majesty.
00:18:12.090,00:18:16.130,听闻太后入住寿康宫后病痛不断,00:18:13.250,00:18:17.460,"I've heard that Your Majesty has constantly
been ill after moving into the Palace of Longevity."
00:18:17.090,00:18:18.330,奴才虽然牵挂,,,
00:18:18.590,00:18:20.330,也不得常常入宫探望,00:18:18.250,00:18:21.680,"Although I was worried, I was unable to
visit the harem very often."
00:18:21.430,00:18:23.220,请太后恕罪,00:18:22.320,00:18:24.820,I hope Your Majesty will forgive me.
00:18:24.180,00:18:27.340,你送来的丸药哀家一直吃着,00:18:25.340,00:18:28.500,I have been taking the medicine you sent me.
00:18:31.020,00:18:34.140,人老了到底不中用了,00:18:32.180,00:18:35.560,But my aging body is no good anymore.
00:18:35.230,00:18:38.440,想当年温僖贵妃跋扈,00:18:36.390,00:18:40.000,"All those years ago, Noble Consort
Wenxi was domineering，"
00:18:39.160,00:18:42.320,良妃夺宠舒妃专宠,00:18:40.320,00:18:44.000,"Consort Liang surpassed my favor,
and Consort Serein gained exclusive favor."
00:18:43.120,00:18:45.320,一件一件事情应付下来,,,
00:18:45.700,00:18:46.860,都不觉得怎样,00:18:44.430,00:18:48.285,"It didn't feel like much to me
after dealing with them one after another."
00:18:48.330,00:18:49.950,可如今回想起来,,,
00:18:50.370,00:18:51.990,都觉得疲累不堪,00:18:49.490,00:18:53.255,"But now, even just thinking back to it
makes me feel exhausted."
00:18:53.170,00:18:54.410,太后万福,00:18:54.330,00:18:56.064,Your Majesty is blessed by Heaven.
00:18:55.420,00:18:58.250,过去的事到底已成云烟,00:18:56.580,00:18:59.580,The past has already vanished like a fleeting cloud.
00:18:59.180,00:19:04.010,终究是太后福泽深厚母仪天下,00:19:00.340,00:19:05.170,"In the end, it was Your Majesty who was blessed
and became the Mother of the Nation."
00:19:04.970,00:19:08.260,话虽如此我却永远记得,00:19:06.130,00:19:09.420,"That being said, I will always remember"
00:19:08.930,00:19:10.890,当初你怎么扶持我,,,
00:19:11.100,00:19:12.890,从一个小小的宫中女官,00:19:10.160,00:19:12.160,how you supported me throughout.
00:19:13.520,00:19:15.510,当上了皇上的德贵人,00:19:12.260,00:19:16.824,"From just a mere Escort to becoming
the prior emperor's Noble Lady Digne,"
00:19:16.530,00:19:18.730,一路又成了德妃,00:19:17.690,00:19:20.120,"and all the way to Consort Digne,"
00:19:19.530,00:19:21.770,最后当上了太后,00:19:20.690,00:19:23.130,"and in the end, the Empress Dowager."
00:19:22.990,00:19:26.230,你的恩情我永远不会忘记,00:19:24.150,00:19:27.390,I will never forget the generous help you gave me.
00:19:28.580,00:19:29.990,奴才不敢居功,00:19:29.740,00:19:31.640,"Your Majesty, I don't deserve the credit."
00:19:32.630,00:19:33.740,数十年来,,,
00:19:34.590,00:19:36.830,奴才日夜不忘的,00:19:33.790,00:19:35.480,"Over the decades,"
00:19:37.710,00:19:39.950,是与太后相识于微时,00:19:35.750,00:19:41.390,"the one thing I always remembered was
when we met in our humble origins."
00:19:42.130,00:19:44.750,那年三月三,00:19:43.290,00:19:46.165,"That year, on the Double Third Festival,"
00:19:46.220,00:19:47.340,上巳节,,,
00:19:48.140,00:19:49.880,太后与奴才,00:19:47.197,00:19:48.634,the third day of the third month
00:19:50.100,00:19:51.090,当日你说,00:19:49.300,00:19:51.040,Your Majesty and I...
,,,00:19:51.260,00:19:52.882,"On that day, you said"
00:19:52.440,00:19:54.550,你已经打通好了关节,00:19:53.536,00:19:55.984,that you had already made arrangements.
00:19:55.730,00:19:59.140,选秀时让我穿一袭粉蓝色衣衫,00:19:56.890,00:20:00.739,"You told me to wear pink and blue
during the Concubine Selection"
00:20:00.700,00:20:02.780,因为先帝不喜欢粉蓝色,00:20:01.860,00:20:04.200,because the prior emperor didn't like those colors.
00:20:03.700,00:20:05.190,我就不会中选,00:20:04.860,00:20:06.600,"That way, I wouldn't be selected"
00:20:05.830,00:20:08.940,然后就顺理成章嫁于你,00:20:06.930,00:20:10.160,and would be able to marry you afterward.
00:20:12.040,00:20:13.650,可是世事难料,00:20:13.200,00:20:15.483,But who can ever foresee things in this world?
00:20:14.670,00:20:18.540,我却偏偏入选成了宫中女官,00:20:15.830,00:20:19.790,I was selected anyway and became a concubine.
00:20:20.010,00:20:23.040,太后福泽深厚 是上天眷顾,00:20:21.170,00:20:24.200,Your Majesty is blessed by Heaven.
00:20:23.380,00:20:25.880,是奴才福薄,00:20:24.540,00:20:27.170,It was my fate.
00:20:27.100,00:20:28.930,福薄不福薄的话,,,
00:20:29.520,00:20:31.010,以后就不要再说了,00:20:28.260,00:20:32.240,There is no need to speak of fate anymore.
00:20:33.100,00:20:34.560,都大半辈子了,00:20:34.260,00:20:35.940,We have already lived the most years of our lives.
00:20:35.310,00:20:36.850,你妻妾成群,00:20:36.470,00:20:38.409,You have your wife and many concubines
00:20:37.520,00:20:39.480,我也成了一国的太后,00:20:38.680,00:20:40.860,and I became the Empress Dowager.
00:20:40.740,00:20:42.940,既然有些事情是注定的,00:20:41.900,00:20:44.100,"Since it was destined to be this way,"
00:20:43.650,00:20:45.140,那谁也改变不了,00:20:44.810,00:20:46.650,no one could have changed it.
00:20:47.830,00:20:49.240,我今天来看你,,,
00:20:49.910,00:20:51.740,除了想要和你叙叙旧,00:20:48.990,00:20:53.000,"I'm here today not only to
reminisce about the past,"
00:20:52.500,00:20:53.660,还想告诉你,00:20:53.660,00:20:55.224,but also to tell you that
00:20:55.210,00:20:58.170,我会设法向皇帝求情,00:20:56.390,00:20:59.410,I will find a way to plead to the emperor for you.
00:20:59.090,00:21:01.790,奴才多谢太后,00:21:00.250,00:21:02.950,I thank Your Majesty.
00:21:02.920,00:21:04.040,快起来吧,00:21:04.080,00:21:05.780,Stand up.

00:21:08.970,00:21:11.930,我为你尽一份心意也是应该的,00:21:10.130,00:21:13.090,It is only right for me to help you out.
00:21:24.070,00:21:27.150,这是你最喜欢的竹叶青,00:21:25.230,00:21:28.660,"This is your favorite Bamboo Leaf Wine,"
00:21:31.120,00:21:35.110,这些小菜都是我亲自下厨所做,00:21:32.280,00:21:36.530,and I prepared these dishes myself in the kitchen.
00:21:37.290,00:21:38.410,事隔多年,00:21:38.450,00:21:40.498,I don't know if my cooking
00:21:40.130,00:21:43.040,不知道我的手艺是否如初,00:21:41.036,00:21:44.230, is still the same as before after all these years.
00:21:49.390,00:21:53.000,一醉解千愁啊,00:21:50.550,00:21:54.160,"""Getting drunk eases a thousand sorrows."""

00:22:10.570,00:22:13.490,忘了我是你自幼相识的乌雅成璧,00:22:11.730,00:22:14.785,"You have forgotten that I'm also
Uya Chengbi, whom you have known from childhood."
00:22:16.750,00:22:19.030,无论世事如何变化,00:22:17.910,00:22:20.360,"No matter how the world has changed,"

00:23:11.590,00:23:13.930,然后才是先帝的德妃,00:23:12.750,00:23:15.225,"and then I am the prior emperor's Consort Digne,"
00:23:15.430,00:23:17.050,你的青梅竹马,00:23:16.590,00:23:18.210,and your bosom friend.
00:23:20.230,00:23:21.890,当年你告诉我,00:23:21.390,00:23:23.185,Back then you told me that
00:23:23.690,00:23:25.850,先帝不喜欢粉蓝色,00:23:24.850,00:23:27.145,"the prior emperor didn't like pink and blue,"
00:23:27.940,00:23:30.360,让我穿粉蓝色去选秀,00:23:29.100,00:23:31.744,"and told me to wear these colors
for the concubine selection."
00:23:33.740,00:23:35.480,原来你早就知道,00:23:34.900,00:23:36.819,"But in fact, you already knew,"
00:23:36.410,00:23:38.400,先帝最喜欢粉蓝色,00:23:37.570,00:23:39.695,the prior emperor's favorite colors were pink and blue.
00:23:40.620,00:23:41.990,你让我入宫,00:23:41.780,00:23:43.464,You wanted me to enter the harem
00:23:43.880,00:23:45.210,只是为了要扶持,,,
00:23:45.460,00:23:47.920,你姐姐孝懿仁皇后在宫中的地位,00:23:45.040,00:23:49.220,"only to support the position of your sister,
the Empress Xiaoyiren, in the harem."
00:23:50.970,00:23:53.750,若不是孝懿仁皇后没有子嗣,00:23:52.130,00:23:54.910,"If Empress Xiaoyiren wasn't childless,"
00:23:55.600,00:23:58.050,你也断不会扶持我儿子,00:23:56.760,00:23:59.345,you would not have supported my son for the throne.
00:24:02.390,00:24:04.180,你断送了我的一生,00:24:03.550,00:24:05.340,You wrote off my life.

00:24:24.540,00:24:25.750,你死了,00:24:25.700,00:24:27.558,Only your death ...
00:24:28.210,00:24:31.450,我儿子才放心,00:24:29.308,00:24:31.149,can bring peace

00:24:51.740,00:24:52.470,是吗,00:24:52.900,00:24:53.899,Is it?
00:24:55.030,00:24:56.150,只有王爷的笛声,,,
00:24:56.490,00:24:57.350,才有这样的情韵,00:24:56.000,00:24:58.860,"Only His Lordship's flute has
such an affecting tone."
00:25:02.080,00:25:04.490,不知道今晚又要吹到几更呢,00:25:03.240,00:25:05.740,I wonder how late he will play until tonight.

00:26:21.910,00:26:22.770,真是可怜,00:26:18.560,00:26:19.739,"Yes, I can."
00:26:23.490,00:26:24.780,外面下起雨来了,00:26:23.070,00:26:24.230,How pitiable.

00:27:07.450,00:27:09.700,是啊来日,00:27:08.580,00:27:09.600,Precisely.
00:27:10.040,00:27:11.700,谁知道来日会是什么样子,00:27:09.600,00:27:11.130,"We always say ""tomorrow""."
00:27:11.960,00:27:13.750,今时今日遂了自己的心愿,00:27:11.130,00:27:12.880,But who knows what tomorrow will bring?

00:27:54.330,00:27:55.200,是啊,00:27:55.520,00:27:56.635,Yes.
00:27:56.210,00:27:58.000,这一步迟早是要迈出去的,00:27:57.400,00:27:59.280,She was going to take that step sooner or later.
00:27:59.130,00:28:00.370,只是迈出去得早,00:28:00.340,00:28:02.200,"The earlier she takes that step,"
00:28:01.050,00:28:03.170,他们二人便能高兴得早一些罢了,00:28:02.240,00:28:04.360,the earlier they will be happy together.

00:28:54.900,00:28:56.100,自己的身子不要了吗,00:28:53.950,00:28:55.720,You shouldn't have come out in the rain.
00:28:56.860,00:28:58.390,是你不要自己的身子了,00:28:56.090,00:28:57.290,Do you not care for your health?
00:28:59.150,00:29:01.810,这么大的雨还在这里吹笛子,00:28:58.050,00:29:03.000,"You're the one who is neglecting your
health, playing the flute in this torrential rain."
00:29:03.990,00:29:05.440,可你最怕打雷闪电了,00:29:05.310,00:29:07.360,But you are scared of lightning and thunder.
00:29:06.820,00:29:09.820,有你在我便不再害怕了,00:29:08.010,00:29:11.010,"With you here, I'm no longer afraid."
00:29:11.910,00:29:12.740,你再说一遍,00:29:13.120,00:29:14.360,Say that again.
00:29:14.290,00:29:17.910,有你在我便不再害怕了,00:29:15.580,00:29:19.200,"With you here, I'm no longer afraid."

00:29:28.890,00:29:30.170,你对我有了这样的心思,00:29:30.010,00:29:31.514,start to feel this way about me?
00:29:32.770,00:29:34.220,或许是在清凉台,00:29:33.960,00:29:35.679,Perhaps at the Cooling Terrace.
00:29:35.980,00:29:37.260,或许是在长河边,00:29:37.270,00:29:38.729,Perhaps next to the river.
00:29:39.440,00:29:40.350,或许更早,00:29:40.630,00:29:41.914,Perhaps even earlier.
00:29:42.110,00:29:43.970,但每每在我最需要你的时候,00:29:43.370,00:29:45.350,"Every time I needed you the most,"

00:29:52.330,00:29:53.240,我都不知道我这些年,00:29:51.560,00:29:53.156,"If you hadn't told me,"
00:29:53.540,00:29:54.650,在你心里是什么样子,00:29:53.156,00:29:55.840,"I wouldn't have known how you
felt about me all these years."

00:30:08.800,00:30:11.460,嬛儿在我心里,00:30:09.990,00:30:12.650,"Huan'er, in my heart,"
00:30:13.020,00:30:14.970,你就是我的天地人间,00:30:14.210,00:30:16.384,"you are my world, my heaven and earth."
00:30:16.440,00:30:19.470,没有你这一切繁华锦绣,00:30:17.630,00:30:20.660,"Without you, all the wealth and riches,"
00:30:20.560,00:30:22.150,于我不过是万念俱空,00:30:21.750,00:30:23.609,they are but emptiness to me.

00:30:26.320,00:30:27.900,从前我无论失去了什么,00:30:27.510,00:30:29.225,"no matter what I have lost before,"
00:30:28.860,00:30:30.100,我都觉得值了,00:30:30.240,00:30:31.480,it has been worth it.
00:30:35.750,00:30:38.410,我是废弃之身 罪臣之女,00:30:36.910,00:30:39.795,"I am a discarded woman,
and daughter of an exiled official."
00:30:39.330,00:30:41.870,被弃之佛门 还生育过女儿,00:30:40.490,00:30:43.200,"I've been banished to practice Buddhism,
and have given birth to a daughter."
00:30:43.000,00:30:46.370,而你有无数名门闺秀可以选择,00:30:44.160,00:30:45.277,But you ...
00:30:47.130,00:30:47.620,实在不必,00:30:45.591,00:30:48.068,"You have countless high-born
ladies to choose from."
00:30:47.840,00:30:49.880,和我这样的残躯败体在一起,00:30:48.068,00:30:50.227,You really don’t have to be with an outcast like me...
00:30:50.430,00:30:52.670,嬛儿你要相信,00:30:51.590,00:30:53.830,"Huan'er, you must believe"

00:31:04.730,00:31:06.640,这种牵手叫做同心扣,00:31:05.890,00:31:07.800,"This kind of hand-holding is called
""a heart-joining lock""."
00:31:08.280,00:31:09.520,这样牵手的男女,00:31:09.440,00:31:11.174,A couple who hold hands like this
00:31:10.490,00:31:11.600,到死也不会分开,00:31:11.650,00:31:12.850,won't be separated till death.
00:31:12.990,00:31:15.820,嬛儿我希望我不是在做梦,00:31:14.150,00:31:16.980,"Huan'er, I hope I'm not dreaming."
00:31:17.080,00:31:19.240,永远都不要分开,00:31:18.240,00:31:20.400,Let us never separate.
00:31:20.420,00:31:22.120,我觉得就是在做梦,00:31:21.580,00:31:23.325,I feel like it is a dream.
00:31:23.590,00:31:24.920,千万不要让我梦醒,00:31:24.750,00:31:26.640,Don't wake me up from this dream.
00:31:30.930,00:31:31.760,这不是梦,00:31:32.090,00:31:33.099,This is not a dream.
00:31:32.470,00:31:34.130,这是我们今后天天都会有的日子,00:31:33.630,00:31:35.380,This is what we will have every day from now.
00:31:35.560,00:31:37.550,嬛儿你知道吗,00:31:36.720,00:31:38.710,"Huan'er, do you know?"
00:31:38.930,00:31:40.420,我得到你我有多高兴,00:31:40.090,00:31:41.715,How happy I am to have you?
00:31:41.850,00:31:43.010,我想马上就对额娘说,00:31:43.010,00:31:44.484,"I want to tell my mother right now,"
00:31:44.860,00:31:45.640,你的儿子,00:31:46.020,00:31:47.069,"""Your son ..."""
00:31:47.110,00:31:48.440,得到了这个世界上,00:31:48.270,00:31:50.000,"""got the person"""
00:31:51.360,00:31:52.820,他最想得到的人,00:31:52.520,00:31:54.159,"""he wanted most in this world."""
00:32:23.520,00:32:24.600,今日怎么这样巧,,,
00:32:24.860,00:32:26.140,王爷和娘子一同来了呢,00:32:24.680,00:32:25.751,What a coincidence!
00:32:26.400,00:32:27.010,额娘呢,00:32:25.751,00:32:27.300,"Your Lordship came together
with Mistress Mochou."
00:32:27.360,00:32:29.100,太妃才诵经完毕 正喝茶呢,00:32:27.560,00:32:28.560,Where is my mother?
,,,00:32:28.560,00:32:30.720,"Her Venerable Highness just finished
chanting scripture and is having some tea."
00:32:30.860,00:32:32.520,额娘 额娘,00:32:32.020,00:32:33.680,"Mother, mother."
00:32:33.030,00:32:33.730,允礼,00:32:34.190,00:32:35.040,Yunli.
00:32:36.280,00:32:37.360,先给额娘行礼吧,00:32:37.440,00:32:38.744,Let’s extend our regards to my mother first.
00:32:38.450,00:32:39.490,给太妃请安,00:32:39.610,00:32:40.785,Peace to Your Venerable Highness.
00:32:41.460,00:32:42.370,给额娘请安,00:32:42.620,00:32:43.680,"Peace to you, mother."
00:32:44.540,00:32:45.750,今儿这是怎么了,,,
00:32:46.250,00:32:47.460,行这么大的礼,00:32:45.700,00:32:47.000,What's the matter today?
,,,00:32:47.410,00:32:48.620,Making such a formal greeting.
00:32:48.500,00:32:49.160,来,00:32:49.660,00:32:50.240,Come.
00:32:51.590,00:32:54.250,好好,00:32:52.750,00:32:53.898,Ah!
,,,00:32:53.898,00:32:55.410,Great! Great!
00:32:55.220,00:32:56.580,总算在一块了,00:32:56.380,00:32:57.760,You two are finally together.
00:32:58.010,00:32:58.840,多谢太妃,00:32:59.170,00:33:00.160,I thank Your Venerable Highness.
00:33:00.350,00:33:01.760,听太妃方才的语气,00:33:01.510,00:33:03.200,It sounds like Your Venerable Highness
00:33:02.890,00:33:04.630,好像早知道我与他,00:33:04.050,00:33:05.835,already knew that he and I...
00:33:07.770,00:33:08.810,我可什么都没说啊,00:33:08.930,00:33:10.284,I didn't say anything.
00:33:12.070,00:33:14.400,允礼当真什么都没跟我说,00:33:13.230,00:33:15.560,Yunli really didn't tell me anything.
00:33:14.990,00:33:18.400,只是你们那一日琴笛合奏,00:33:16.150,00:33:20.000,I have known since the day when you played the zither and flute together.
00:33:20.160,00:33:22.950,真当我老了什么也瞧不出来了吗,00:33:21.320,00:33:24.110,Did you think that I was too old to see it?
00:33:24.250,00:33:26.160,心有灵犀这回事啊,00:33:25.410,00:33:27.566,"When two hearts are connected in love,"
00:33:26.630,00:33:30.330,本当是情意相通的人才有灵犀,00:33:27.835,00:33:31.448,"they are linked as heaven and earth by the ""divine rhino's horn""."
00:33:32.510,00:33:34.210,来好孩子,00:33:33.670,00:33:35.370,"Come here, my dear."
00:33:36.840,00:33:37.670,那一日啊,00:33:38.000,00:33:39.189,"On that day,"
00:33:38.430,00:33:40.670,我只不过是转了转那样的念头,00:33:39.590,00:33:42.189,it had just crossed my mind ever so slightly.
00:33:41.520,00:33:45.300,不曾想你我还有这样的缘分,00:33:42.680,00:33:46.460,"I never thought that you and I
have a shared fate so deep."
00:33:47.400,00:33:48.310,快坐孩子,00:33:48.560,00:33:49.784,"Sit down, my dear."
00:33:52.230,00:33:54.690,傻孩子你也不早点告诉我,00:33:53.390,00:33:55.850,"Silly boy, why didn't you tell me earlier."
00:33:55.110,00:33:56.520,当真瞒得我好苦,,,
00:33:56.820,00:33:58.030,此事也是峰回路转,00:33:56.270,00:33:57.680,"You put me through a lot
by hiding this from me."
00:33:58.700,00:33:59.860,也是刚刚才定下来,00:33:57.980,00:33:59.800,This matter just took a favorable turn.
00:34:00.830,00:34:02.280,儿子这不赶紧就带着嬛儿,00:33:59.860,00:34:01.334,It was only settled yesterday.
00:34:02.620,00:34:03.650,来给额娘请安了吗,00:34:01.990,00:34:03.530,That is why I hurried here with Huan'er
,,,00:34:03.780,00:34:04.989,to pay our respects.
00:34:06.410,00:34:08.280,嬛儿我带你来见额娘,00:34:07.570,00:34:09.619,"Huan'er, I brought you to see my mother"
00:34:09.750,00:34:10.870,就是想让你知道,00:34:10.910,00:34:12.400,because I wanted you to know
00:34:12.000,00:34:14.120,我和你绝对不是朝夕露水之情,00:34:13.160,00:34:15.600,that this is not my ephemeral affection.
00:34:15.090,00:34:18.210,而是希望执子之手与子偕老,00:34:16.250,00:34:19.370,I hope to hold your hand and grow old with you.
00:34:20.260,00:34:22.880,允礼这样说可见他对你用心,00:34:21.420,00:34:22.815,What Yunli said
00:34:23.180,00:34:24.470,不是一天两天的事了,00:34:22.815,00:34:25.630,"shows that his affection for you
has been long in the making."
00:34:25.680,00:34:28.970,从前的路你们总算熬过来了,00:34:26.840,00:34:30.130,You have finally made it here together.
00:34:29.850,00:34:31.690,守得云开见月明,00:34:30.786,00:34:33.270,"""Persevere until the clouds have parted,
you can now see the bright moon."""
00:34:32.110,00:34:33.770,我心里十分安慰啊,00:34:33.270,00:34:34.930,I feel so delighted.
00:34:35.740,00:34:37.570,方才来的时候我还害怕,00:34:36.900,00:34:38.730,I was worried that
00:34:39.360,00:34:40.900,怕太妃会不喜欢我,00:34:40.520,00:34:42.195,Your Venerable Highness might dislike me.
00:34:41.910,00:34:44.150,我知道你在意什么,00:34:43.070,00:34:45.265,I understand your worries.
00:34:45.450,00:34:47.940,只是过去的就都过去了,00:34:46.610,00:34:49.100,But the past has become the past.
00:34:48.920,00:34:50.160,大清开国以来,00:34:50.080,00:34:51.544,"Since the founding of the Great Qing,"
00:34:50.670,00:34:52.700,没听说过废妃再回去的,00:34:51.830,00:34:54.039,"I've never heard of a banished
concubine returning to the palace."
00:34:53.920,00:34:55.910,与其老死宫外,,,
00:34:56.380,00:34:57.250,不如想法子,00:34:55.300,00:34:57.335,"Rather than dying of old age outside,"
00:34:57.720,00:34:59.550,过些自己想过的日子吧,00:34:57.730,00:35:00.900,"why not find a way to live the life
you want to live?"
00:35:00.970,00:35:02.130,人生百年,,,
00:35:02.720,00:35:04.840,真正能顺心遂意的日子,00:35:02.130,00:35:03.604,"In the hundred years of life,"
00:35:05.350,00:35:06.630,又有多少呢,00:35:03.880,00:35:07.790,"how many days are there
when you can satisfy your wishes?"
00:35:09.810,00:35:12.050,今天真是个好日子,00:35:10.970,00:35:13.210,It's a good day today.
00:35:12.900,00:35:16.230,长相思与长相守总算在一块了,00:35:14.280,00:35:17.206,"Endless Longing and Eternal Promise
are finally together."
00:35:16.860,00:35:18.480,总算没有白辜负,,,
00:35:19.530,00:35:21.520,两个人真心喜欢彼此,00:35:18.240,00:35:20.160,They didn't fail to commit to each other.
00:35:22.320,00:35:23.610,是件难得的事,00:35:20.880,00:35:24.960,Mutual and wholehearted love is a rare treasure.
00:35:25.950,00:35:27.320,好好惜福吧,00:35:27.370,00:35:28.800,Treasure your happiness.
00:35:28.540,00:35:31.250,太妃的话 嬛儿铭记在心,00:35:29.920,00:35:32.630,"I will always remember
Your Venerable Highness's words."
00:35:37.380,00:35:40.170,皇上您喝碗参茶吧,00:35:38.540,00:35:41.330,"Your Majesty, please take a cup of ginseng tea."
00:35:42.300,00:35:43.790,太后的身子怎么样了,00:35:43.650,00:35:45.319,How is the Empress Dowager?
00:35:44.760,00:35:45.920,还是不大好,00:35:45.920,00:35:47.304,Still not very well.
00:35:46.470,00:35:49.930,太医说心悸多梦 气郁五内,00:35:47.641,00:35:50.000,"The imperial doctor said Her Majesty
is plagued with uneasy dreams"
00:35:50.560,00:35:52.890,皇上您要不要去看看,00:35:50.000,00:35:51.989,because stagnant qi has filled the five organs.
00:35:53.400,00:35:55.100,太后的病是心病,00:35:51.989,00:35:54.319,Is Your Majesty going to visit Her Majesty?
00:35:55.770,00:35:56.980,太医都治不好,00:35:54.560,00:35:56.529,Her illness comes from her heart.
00:35:57.780,00:35:59.110,朕去有什么用,00:35:56.881,00:35:58.600,Even the imperial doctors can't cure it.
,,,00:35:59.061,00:36:00.660,What help would my visit be？
00:36:00.490,00:36:03.350,皇上您有些日子没去看太后了,00:36:01.650,00:36:04.510,"It's been a long time since Your Majesty
last visited Her Majesty."
00:36:03.820,00:36:06.780,也说不准皇上要是去了,00:36:04.980,00:36:07.940,"If Your Majesty goes to see her,"
00:36:07.160,00:36:09.400,太后一见心宽了,,,
00:36:09.910,00:36:11.200,这病就好了嘛,00:36:08.320,00:36:12.360,It might ease Her Majesty's mind and help her recover.
00:36:11.410,00:36:12.570,太后病得那么重,,,
00:36:13.540,00:36:14.750,朕都没想到,00:36:12.760,00:36:14.240,She is so seriously ill ...
,,,00:36:14.970,00:36:16.630,I would have never expected it.
00:36:16.090,00:36:18.420,太后的病是因朕而起,00:36:17.390,00:36:19.580,Her illness was caused by me.
00:36:19.420,00:36:21.580,太后恨朕都说不准,00:36:20.580,00:36:22.605,She might even hate me.
00:36:21.970,00:36:23.130,朕去了能干什么,,,
00:36:24.090,00:36:24.550,皇上,00:36:23.060,00:36:24.761,What could I do to help if I visit?
00:36:24.720,00:36:25.460,别说了,00:36:25.250,00:36:25.750,Your Majesty…
,,,00:36:25.880,00:36:26.620,Enough.
00:36:26.350,00:36:29.590,摆驾延禧宫 朕去看看安嫔,00:36:27.510,00:36:30.750,"I'll go to the Palace of Prolonging
Happiness to see Concubine An."
00:36:30.060,00:36:30.760,嗻,00:36:31.220,00:36:31.920,Yes.
00:36:43.410,00:36:44.440,你这孩子,00:36:44.340,00:36:45.667,Silly girl.
00:36:45.700,00:36:46.810,哀家一病,00:36:46.860,00:36:48.239,"Ever since I fell ill,"
00:36:47.740,00:36:50.650,你倒守在这里当自己宫里了,00:36:48.900,00:36:51.810,"you've been staying here as if
it was your own palace."
00:36:51.450,00:36:54.120,能为太后尽心是臣妾的福气,00:36:52.610,00:36:55.280,It's my great honor to serve Your Majesty.
00:36:56.000,00:36:58.830,皇帝都未必有你这份孝心,00:36:57.160,00:37:00.259,"The emperor might not even harbor
such filial piety as you do."
00:37:00.170,00:37:02.330,对了皇帝在哪儿,00:37:01.330,00:37:03.490,"In fact, where is the emperor?"
00:37:07.470,00:37:08.210,你说,00:37:08.630,00:37:09.840,"Bamboo, tell me."
00:37:10.930,00:37:13.640,皇上在养心殿处理隆科多后事,00:37:12.090,00:37:14.800,"His Majesty is busy arranging
Longkodo's posthumous affairs,"
00:37:14.100,00:37:15.310,清除党羽,00:37:15.260,00:37:16.739,and purging his supporters.
00:37:18.520,00:37:21.560,好好,00:37:19.680,00:37:20.701,Very well.
,,,00:37:21.912,00:37:23.124,Very well.
00:37:22.740,00:37:24.940,皇帝要当个好皇帝,00:37:23.707,00:37:26.240,He wants to be a good emperor.
00:37:25.660,00:37:27.070,哀家应该高兴,00:37:26.820,00:37:28.275,I should be glad.
00:37:29.120,00:37:32.150,所以哀家也不能怪皇帝不来请安,00:37:30.280,00:37:33.310,So I can't blame him for not paying his respects.
00:37:34.160,00:37:36.120,原是哀家病得不对,00:37:35.320,00:37:37.280,I should blame myself for falling ill.
00:37:36.370,00:37:37.080,太后,00:37:37.530,00:37:38.599,"Your Majesty,"
00:37:37.790,00:37:39.750,您怎么说这样伤心的话,00:37:38.950,00:37:40.910,why do you sound so sad?
00:37:40.380,00:37:41.960,哀家不是伤心,00:37:41.540,00:37:43.120,I'm not sad.
00:37:43.170,00:37:45.460,哀家是替皇帝高兴,00:37:44.330,00:37:46.620,I'm happy for the emperor.
00:37:53.480,00:37:57.760,好孩子如今也只剩下你,00:37:54.640,00:37:58.920,"My child, you're now the only one"
00:37:58.770,00:38:01.510,时时在哀家跟前尽心了,00:37:59.930,00:38:02.760,staying by my side taking care of me all the time.
00:38:05.240,00:38:08.100,竹息传哀家的旨意,00:38:06.400,00:38:09.260,"Bamboo, announce my decree."
00:38:09.530,00:38:12.070,晋惠贵人为惠嫔,00:38:10.690,00:38:13.230,Noble Lady Vertu is promoted to Concubine Vertu.
00:38:13.950,00:38:14.740,是,,,
00:38:16.370,00:38:17.490,臣妾孝敬太后,00:38:15.110,00:38:16.169,Yes.
00:38:17.790,00:38:19.000,不是为了尊荣位分,00:38:17.530,00:38:20.160,I serve Your Majesty not for titles or ranks.
00:38:19.210,00:38:20.290,哀家知道,00:38:20.370,00:38:21.450,I know.
00:38:21.500,00:38:23.920,哀家就是要成全你的孝心,00:38:22.660,00:38:25.080,It's your filial duty that I wish to reward you for.
00:38:24.880,00:38:26.960,如果不是有你时时在这里,00:38:26.040,00:38:28.096,"Without you serving here all the time,"
00:38:28.130,00:38:31.130,皇帝就要被天下的人,,,
00:38:31.470,00:38:32.680,指责为不孝了,00:38:29.290,00:38:33.840,"the emperor would have been
accused of filial impiety by the people."
00:38:35.060,00:38:35.800,是,00:38:36.220,00:38:37.095,Yes.
00:38:38.810,00:38:39.770,多谢太后,00:38:39.970,00:38:41.154,I thank Your Majesty.
00:38:42.900,00:38:44.860,皇上最近一直烦心不堪,00:38:44.060,00:38:46.020,Your Majesty has been quite bothered these days.
00:38:45.690,00:38:48.860,臣妾自知无能不能为皇上解忧,00:38:46.850,00:38:50.020,"I know I am incapable of
easing Your Majesty's worries."
00:38:50.070,00:38:53.530,朕来你这里已经能宽心不少了,00:38:51.280,00:38:54.608,Coming here has already made me feel better.
00:38:54.040,00:38:55.240,能让皇上宽慰,,,
00:38:55.790,00:38:57.820,臣妾也觉得自己卑微之躯,00:38:55.310,00:39:00.302,"Being able to soothe Your Majesty makes
me feel that my humble being is of some use."
00:38:58.160,00:38:59.200,有所益处了,,,
00:38:59.460,00:39:01.410,你不要妄自菲薄,00:39:00.620,00:39:02.570,You should not look down upon yourself.
00:39:02.590,00:39:05.950,宫中的嫔妃你最温柔谦和,00:39:03.750,00:39:07.110,"You are the most modest and mild
among all the concubines."
00:39:06.300,00:39:07.580,让朕觉得舒服,00:39:07.460,00:39:09.368,I feel comfortable with you.
00:39:09.800,00:39:11.420,臣妾新调了一种香,,,
00:39:12.180,00:39:13.540,最能富神愉悦,00:39:10.960,00:39:12.715,I made a new incense.
00:39:14.350,00:39:15.590,已经点起来了,00:39:13.340,00:39:15.149,It's the most effective at calming the mind.
00:39:16.100,00:39:18.140,皇上觉得闻着如何,00:39:15.510,00:39:16.885,I have already lighted it.
00:39:19.140,00:39:21.100,清雅中不失甜美,00:39:17.260,00:39:19.360,How does Your Majesty like it?
00:39:21.860,00:39:22.810,和你一样,00:39:20.300,00:39:24.070,"Gentle yet sweet, just like you."
00:39:56.470,00:39:57.800,怎么这么早就过来了,,,
00:39:58.060,00:39:59.260,一早骑马回了清凉台,00:39:57.630,00:39:59.220,Why did you come so early?
00:39:59.850,00:40:00.930,见开了第一束玉兰,00:39:59.220,00:40:00.920,"I rode back to the Cooling Terrace early this morning,"
00:40:01.480,00:40:02.510,特地拿来给你,00:40:01.010,00:40:02.600,and saw that the first magnolia tree has blossomed.
,,,00:40:02.640,00:40:03.939,So I brought some for you.
00:40:03.650,00:40:05.890,山花烂漫处你我相见,00:40:04.810,00:40:07.680,We meet where full blossoms envelop the mountain.
00:40:11.240,00:40:12.150,吃过东西没有,00:40:12.400,00:40:13.579,Have you eaten yet?
00:40:13.110,00:40:15.200,就急着过来看你我一点都不饿,00:40:14.270,00:40:16.360,"I was in a hurry to come see you.
I'm not hungry at all."
00:40:16.330,00:40:18.530,嘴这么甜跟抹了蜜似的,00:40:17.490,00:40:19.680,"You talk so sweetly as if
your lips were smeared with honey."
00:40:21.410,00:40:22.750,宫里可出了什么事,00:40:22.794,00:40:24.313,Has something happened in the palace?
00:40:25.000,00:40:28.590,隆科多圈禁而死 太后病重,00:40:26.160,00:40:28.308,Long Keduo died while in confinement.
,,,00:40:28.846,00:40:30.378,The Empress Dowager is gravely ill.
00:40:30.210,00:40:33.080,兔死狗烹是皇上惯用的权术,00:40:31.080,00:40:33.280,"""Boiling the hound after it kills the cunning hare."""
00:40:34.180,00:40:35.590,今时今日你提起他,00:40:33.280,00:40:34.960,This is a common tactic of His Majesty.
00:40:35.890,00:40:37.420,就像是一个无关紧要的人,00:40:35.340,00:40:38.753,You speak of him today like he's nobody to you.
00:40:39.680,00:40:41.170,本就是个无关紧要的人,00:40:40.840,00:40:42.911,He is of no concern to me.
00:40:45.480,00:40:47.810,真巧我正想画画呢,00:40:46.640,00:40:48.970,"How coincidental, I was just feeling like painting."
00:40:48.190,00:40:49.180,你把东西都摆好了,00:40:49.350,00:40:50.833,You've had set everything up.
00:40:50.440,00:40:51.310,我来画你好不好,00:40:51.600,00:40:52.694,Can I draw you?
00:41:07.920,00:41:09.250,哪有画师是这样的,00:41:09.080,00:41:10.814,What kind of painter is like this?
00:41:09.750,00:41:11.840,看都不看人一眼只顾低头作画,00:41:10.814,00:41:12.814,"You're drawing my portrait without
even looking at me."
00:41:12.130,00:41:13.040,画出来能像吗,00:41:13.290,00:41:14.469,How can it resemble me?
00:41:33.610,00:41:34.520,你自己过来看看,00:41:34.770,00:41:35.949,Come and look for yourself.
00:41:40.120,00:41:40.820,果然不错,,,
00:41:42.500,00:41:43.610,我虽然没有看到你,00:41:41.280,00:41:42.429,Nicely done.
00:41:44.290,00:41:45.820,但是你的样子刻在我的心里,00:41:43.660,00:41:44.995,"Although I did not look at you,"
00:41:46.420,00:41:47.450,怎么能画不出来呢,00:41:45.450,00:41:47.159,your visage was already carved into my mind.
00:41:48.000,00:41:48.790,又胡说,00:41:47.580,00:41:49.160,So why would I not be able to paint it?
,,,00:41:49.160,00:41:50.354,You are talking nonsense.
00:41:51.960,00:41:54.200,看看在这儿,00:41:53.120,00:41:55.268,If I do this here...
00:41:57.890,00:41:58.750,这样就更像了,00:41:58.497,00:42:00.424,It looks even more like me now.
00:42:06.690,00:42:07.470,你来了,,,
00:42:08.100,00:42:08.840,我来得不巧,00:42:07.850,00:42:08.854,You're here.
00:42:09.730,00:42:10.390,无妨,00:42:09.260,00:42:10.359,I came at a bad time.
,,,00:42:10.890,00:42:11.954,No matter.
00:42:14.400,00:42:16.890,允礼他不是外人,00:42:15.560,00:42:18.050,Yunli... is not an outsider.
00:42:18.200,00:42:18.980,允礼,00:42:19.360,00:42:20.364,Yunli?

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.260,00:43:00.260,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.260,00:43:20.260,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.260,00:43:37.260,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:37.260,00:43:55.260,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:55.260,00:44:03.260,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:03.260,00:44:15.260,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:15.260,00:44:34.260,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
