00:02:23.850,00:02:24.880,你们都不用跟着了,00:02:23.850,00:02:25.920,You can all stay outside. I'll look after My Lady from here.
00:02:25.100,00:02:25.930,我一个人伺候就行,,,
00:02:26.310,00:02:26.920,是,00:02:26.310,00:02:26.920,Yes.
00:02:34.440,00:02:35.270,有什么话就说,00:02:34.440,00:02:35.270,You can speak now.
00:02:35.610,00:02:37.270,她方才假惺惺地说了几句话,00:02:35.610,00:02:39.000,"My Lady, you aren't going to trust her again
after just a few smarmy words, are you?"
00:02:37.570,00:02:38.780,小主你就又信她了吗,,,
00:02:39.150,00:02:40.110,我为什么不信她,00:02:39.150,00:02:40.110,Why shouldn't I trust her?
00:02:40.410,00:02:41.740,奴婢方才看得真真的,00:02:40.410,00:02:41.934,I saw clearly just now...
00:02:42.120,00:02:43.320,她那香囊里分明就是,00:02:42.123,00:02:43.320,In her sachet there was ...
00:02:43.780,00:02:44.650,你既知她香囊里面,00:02:43.780,00:02:45.800,"If you know what was in her sachet,"
00:02:44.990,00:02:45.860,装的是什么东西,,,
00:02:46.410,00:02:48.070,就知道她苦心孤诣要做什么,00:02:46.040,00:02:48.600,then you should know what she's putting herself through.
00:02:51.250,00:02:54.330,她今日所说的话未必全都是谎话,00:02:51.250,00:02:55.166,What she said today wasn't necessarily all lies.
00:02:55.840,00:02:56.950,倒也有几分可信,00:02:55.834,00:02:57.600,There could be some truth in it.
00:02:59.720,00:03:00.330,槿汐,00:02:59.720,00:03:00.480,Jinxi.
00:03:03.550,00:03:04.170,娘娘,00:03:03.550,00:03:04.400,Your Highness.
00:03:05.930,00:03:08.010,你去见了苏培盛他怎么说,00:03:05.930,00:03:08.010,"You've asked Su Peisheng.
What did he say?"
00:03:08.890,00:03:09.760,苏培盛说,,,
00:03:10.230,00:03:11.340,祺嫔和安嫔现如今,00:03:08.890,00:03:13.120,"He said that although Concubine Délice and Concubine An
are both following the empress,"
00:03:11.810,00:03:13.050,都是皇后身边的人,,,
00:03:13.770,00:03:16.010,不过二人一直面和心不和,00:03:13.770,00:03:16.120,things between them are not as harmonious as they seem.
00:03:16.650,00:03:18.980,近来皇后呢偏看重祺嫔,00:03:16.650,00:03:18.980,"Recently, the empress has been favoring Concubine Délice,"
00:03:19.530,00:03:21.610,安嫔难免有些失意了,00:03:19.530,00:03:22.100," so naturally, Concubine An is feeling downhearted."
00:03:22.740,00:03:26.200,祺嫔性子更浅薄张扬,00:03:22.740,00:03:26.200,Concubine Délice is shallower and brasher.
00:03:27.330,00:03:28.490,换了我是皇后,00:03:27.330,00:03:28.490,"If I were the empress,"
00:03:29.200,00:03:31.040,也会觉得祺嫔更容易驾驭,00:03:29.200,00:03:31.601,I would consider Concubine Délice easier to control.
00:03:32.290,00:03:34.500,安陵容生性阴狠城府颇深,00:03:32.290,00:03:34.500,"An Lingrong has an insidious nature and deep guile,"
00:03:35.250,00:03:36.910,与皇后是一路性子的人,00:03:35.250,00:03:36.910,just like the empress herself.
00:03:38.130,00:03:39.340,我看哪怕是皇后,,,
00:03:40.130,00:03:41.590,也未必能将她完全掌控,00:03:38.130,00:03:41.800,It seems even the empress can't fully control her.
00:03:42.760,00:03:43.870,这些人蛇鼠一窝,,,
00:03:44.510,00:03:45.720,也竟有这样内斗的时候,00:03:42.760,00:03:45.952,"It's delightful to see these ""snakes and rats"""
00:03:46.050,00:03:46.670,真是痛快,00:03:45.952,00:03:47.552,at each others' throats.
00:03:48.140,00:03:50.050,小主那你预备怎么做,00:03:48.140,00:03:50.050,"My Lady, are you going to do anything?"
00:03:51.350,00:03:53.140,安陵容特来告诉我此事,00:03:51.350,00:03:53.400,"An Lingrong made the effort to speak to me,"
00:03:54.060,00:03:55.300,我倒不妨坦然接受,00:03:54.060,00:03:55.707,I might as well accept what she said.
00:03:56.860,00:03:57.560,洗碧,00:03:56.860,00:03:57.961,"Jade,"
00:03:58.280,00:03:59.140,你去告诉佩儿,,,
00:03:59.860,00:04:00.820,让她转告欣贵人,00:03:58.280,00:04:01.120,tell Violet to inform Lady Joie of An's words.
00:04:01.360,00:04:01.900,好,00:04:01.360,00:04:01.900,Yes.
00:04:05.820,00:04:08.240,娘娘皇上晚上要过来,00:04:05.820,00:04:10.440,"Your Highness, we should start preparing
for His Majesty's visit tonight."
00:04:08.700,00:04:10.440,不妨咱们先准备着,,,
00:04:11.660,00:04:12.700,有什么好准备的,00:04:11.480,00:04:12.800,What is there to prepare?
00:04:14.920,00:04:16.700,奴婢刚才已经听小允子说了,,,
00:04:17.380,00:04:19.660,公主对娘娘生疏的情景,00:04:14.920,00:04:19.680,"I just heard from Xiao-Yunzi that the princess is still
not comfortable around Your Highness."
00:04:20.670,00:04:22.330,难怪娘娘会生皇上的气,00:04:20.670,00:04:22.600,It's no wonder that Your Highness is still angry at His Majesty.
00:04:22.800,00:04:25.510,始作俑者其无后乎,00:04:22.800,00:04:26.752,"""Terracotta warriors are molded from a ruler's vanity,
but the sculptors have their own thoughts."""
00:04:31.520,00:04:34.220,皇上 您喝碗莲子汤吧,00:04:31.520,00:04:34.400,"Your Majesty, have some lotus seed soup."
00:04:35.440,00:04:36.680,这个最消暑了,00:04:35.440,00:04:36.880,It can cool the Summer Heat.
00:04:39.230,00:04:40.940,让人去看过熹妃了吗,00:04:39.230,00:04:41.320,Have you sent someone to see Consort Lumière？
00:04:41.320,00:04:42.650,熹妃可好些了吗,00:04:41.320,00:04:42.650,Is she better?
00:04:43.610,00:04:44.650,还是老样子,00:04:43.610,00:04:44.650,Still the same -
00:04:45.320,00:04:46.780,老这么闷闷不乐的,00:04:45.320,00:04:46.780, dispirited and unhappy.
00:04:47.370,00:04:49.900,皇上您说熹妃娘娘这么熬着,00:04:47.370,00:04:51.400,"Your Majesty, even if Consort Lumière is holding up,"
00:04:50.330,00:04:51.190,她受得了,,,
00:04:51.500,00:04:53.610,肚子里的龙子可受不了啊,00:04:51.720,00:04:54.460,it still might affect the heir in her belly.
00:04:54.460,00:04:55.950,朕何尝不着急啊,00:04:54.460,00:04:55.950,I'm also worried.
00:04:56.630,00:04:59.330,这样安排些歌舞杂技的,00:04:56.630,00:05:01.320,How about arranging some performers to cheer her up?
00:04:59.920,00:05:01.000,哄熹妃高兴,,,
00:05:01.920,00:05:03.160,皇上您这么办,,,
00:05:03.590,00:05:05.460,可没办到娘娘的心坎上,00:05:01.920,00:05:05.440,"Your Majesty, performers might not reach Her Highness's heart."
00:05:05.760,00:05:06.970,娘娘高兴不了,00:05:05.760,00:05:06.970,Her Highness might not cheer up.
00:05:07.300,00:05:08.210,那你说怎么办,00:05:07.300,00:05:08.566,What's your idea then?
00:05:09.760,00:05:10.920,娘娘一人在宫中,,,
00:05:11.220,00:05:12.510,自然是思念家人哪,00:05:09.760,00:05:12.800,"Her Highness is alone in the palace,
so she must miss her family."
00:05:13.100,00:05:14.930,可是公主又不与她亲近,00:05:13.100,00:05:15.120,But the princess is yet to warm up to her...
00:05:15.890,00:05:18.260,皇上何不让她见见其他的家人,00:05:15.890,00:05:18.260,Why not let her see her other family members?
00:05:18.770,00:05:20.640,兴许见了面疏散了心肠,00:05:18.770,00:05:22.120,"Her Highness might feel eased after
talking to them heart to heart."
00:05:21.150,00:05:22.140,倒也就好了,,,
00:05:24.530,00:05:25.890,朕心里有数,00:05:24.530,00:05:25.890,I've thought about it.
00:05:27.240,00:05:29.320,甄远道的病还未好全,00:05:27.240,00:05:29.320,Zhen Yuandao is still sick.
00:05:30.740,00:05:32.530,怕过了病气给熹妃,00:05:30.740,00:05:32.800,He might pass the pathogenic qi to Consort Lumière.
00:05:33.500,00:05:35.530,等甄远道的身子好了,00:05:33.500,00:05:37.600,I'll let them reunite after Zhen Yuandao recovers.
00:05:36.160,00:05:37.620,自然会让他们相见,,,
00:05:43.420,00:05:45.290,皇上驾到,00:05:43.420,00:05:45.290,His Majesty the Emperor!
00:05:48.890,00:05:49.970,皇上万福金安,00:05:48.890,00:05:49.970,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:05:50.180,00:05:50.790,快起来吧,00:05:50.180,00:05:50.790,Rise.
00:05:51.050,00:05:51.710,谢皇上,00:05:51.050,00:05:51.710,I thank Your Majesty.
00:05:57.890,00:05:59.480,今日可舒心了吧,00:05:57.890,00:05:59.480,Are you feeling better today?
00:06:01.190,00:06:02.270,多谢皇上恩典,00:06:01.080,00:06:02.600,I thank Your Majesty for your grace.
00:06:03.440,00:06:04.480,听苏公公说,00:06:03.440,00:06:04.480,I heard from Mr. Su
00:06:04.940,00:06:06.730,皇上答允父亲病愈后,00:06:04.940,00:06:08.200, that Your Majesty will permit me to see my father when he recovers.
00:06:07.030,00:06:08.110,可以和臣妾相见,,,
00:06:08.990,00:06:10.270,臣妾心里好受多了,00:06:08.990,00:06:10.270,My heart is greatly relieved.
00:06:11.530,00:06:12.900,臣妾现在别无所求,,,
00:06:13.620,00:06:15.360,只盼一家子平平安安的,00:06:11.530,00:06:15.360,"Now, my only wish is for
the peace and good health of my family,"
00:06:15.950,00:06:18.200,能为皇上诞下一位皇子就是了,00:06:15.950,00:06:18.200,and giving birth to a new prince for Your Majesty.
00:06:19.420,00:06:21.660,娘娘的家人就是皇上的家人,00:06:19.420,00:06:21.800,Your Highness's family is His Majesty's family.
00:06:21.960,00:06:23.290,皇上怎能不重视呢,,,
00:06:23.920,00:06:25.460,娘娘只管安心就是了,00:06:21.960,00:06:25.400,"How could His Majesty not care about them?
Your Highness need not worry."
00:06:26.720,00:06:29.300,皇上敬事房的人刚才来问,00:06:26.720,00:06:32.560,"Your Majesty, Attendant Services came to ask
if you will select a name tag for tonight."
00:06:29.970,00:06:32.380,皇上今晚是否还要翻脾子,,,
00:06:33.050,00:06:35.050,不用翻了就在熹妃这里,00:06:33.050,00:06:35.050,"No, I will stay here tonight."
00:06:35.640,00:06:36.220,嗻,00:06:35.640,00:06:36.220,Yes.
00:06:36.850,00:06:38.470,皇上又忘了太医的嘱咐,00:06:36.850,00:06:38.800,Did Your Majesty forget what the doctor said?
00:06:39.100,00:06:40.760,陪你待着也是好的,00:06:39.100,00:06:40.800,It's nice to just stay with you.
00:06:41.940,00:06:43.720,臣妾可不愿意委屈了皇上,00:06:41.940,00:06:44.000,I don't want Your Majesty to endure the poor hospitality here.
00:06:44.730,00:06:46.220,皇上也别来招惹臣妾,00:06:44.730,00:06:47.880,Your Majesty should go ruffle someone else's feathers.
00:06:46.860,00:06:47.900,还是去别处吧,,,
00:06:49.910,00:06:50.770,那就,00:06:49.910,00:06:50.770,Then...
00:06:53.330,00:06:54.190,春禧殿吧,00:06:53.330,00:06:54.680,The Hall of Spring Joy.
00:06:55.040,00:06:55.690,嘛,00:06:55.040,00:06:55.690,Aye.
00:06:55.950,00:06:58.190,奴才这就去请富贵人准备着,00:06:55.950,00:06:58.190,I'll go to notify Lady Paix.
00:06:59.410,00:07:01.910,只不过经过储秀宫的时候,00:06:59.410,00:07:02.290,It's just that we'll have to hear Concubine Délice whining again
00:07:02.290,00:07:04.370,可又要听祺嫔在那儿嘀咕了,00:07:02.290,00:07:04.370,when we pass the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:07:05.880,00:07:08.090,怎么她们时常议论朕,00:07:05.880,00:07:09.400,Why? Do they often talk about me favoring Lady Paix?
00:07:08.380,00:07:09.420,宠爱甯贵人吗,,,
00:07:09.840,00:07:10.960,倒也不是时常,00:07:09.840,00:07:10.960,"No, not often."
00:07:11.470,00:07:13.880,只不过奴才偶尔听见过几次,00:07:11.470,00:07:13.880,I've only heard that sort of talk a couple of times.
00:07:14.640,00:07:15.800,这也难怪祺嫔,,,
00:07:16.310,00:07:17.800,太后不喜欢甯贵人,00:07:14.640,00:07:19.800,"Her Majesty the Empress Dowager dislikes Lady Paix.
It's only natural for others to share her feelings."
00:07:18.140,00:07:19.260,更别说旁人了,,,
00:07:19.940,00:07:21.270,太后是太后,00:07:19.940,00:07:21.270,"Her Majesty is the Empress Dowager,"
00:07:21.900,00:07:22.980,她是什么东西,00:07:21.900,00:07:23.223,but who is Concubine Délice?
00:07:23.860,00:07:25.560,祺嫔不过是爱吃醋罢了,00:07:23.860,00:07:25.560,Concubine Délice is just jealous.
00:07:26.320,00:07:28.680,大热天的皇上别气坏了身子,00:07:26.320,00:07:28.680,"Getting angry on such a hot day
might harm Your Majesty's health."
00:07:31.780,00:07:32.640,启禀皇上,00:07:31.780,00:07:32.640,"Your Majesty,"
00:07:33.910,00:07:36.490,储秀宫来人说祺嫔身子不大痛快,00:07:33.910,00:07:36.490,"the Palace of Gathering Excellence reported that
Concubine Délice is feeling unwell."
00:07:36.790,00:07:38.120,皇上可要去看一看,00:07:36.790,00:07:38.521,Will Your Majesty go to see her?
00:07:39.290,00:07:42.200,不痛快就找太医 朕又不会治病,00:07:39.290,00:07:42.200,"She should call for a doctor if she's sick.
I can't cure her."
00:07:48.250,00:07:50.920,糊涂东西 就说朕忙着,00:07:48.250,00:07:50.920,Don't stand there gawking. Tell her I'm busy.
00:07:51.760,00:07:52.370,嘛,00:07:51.760,00:07:52.370,Aye.
00:07:54.180,00:07:56.460,原来皇上老爱这么糊弄人哪,00:07:54.180,00:07:56.460,I didn't know that Your Majesty had a penchant for deception.
00:07:57.600,00:07:59.800,她嘴碎 朕懒得见她,00:07:57.600,00:07:59.800,I'm tired of her endless chatter.
00:08:00.520,00:08:01.930,皇上不爱见就不见吧,00:08:00.280,00:08:02.723,Your Majesty doesn't need to see her if it displeases you.
00:08:02.690,00:08:03.850,何必告诉臣妾,00:08:02.723,00:08:04.160,But justifying it to me
00:08:04.730,00:08:07.190,好像倒弄得是臣妾的不是了,00:08:04.730,00:08:07.240,makes it seem like I am the reason you're not seeing her.
00:08:07.730,00:08:09.060,自然是你的不是了,00:08:07.730,00:08:09.200,Of course it's because of you.
00:08:10.530,00:08:11.690,你若笨一点,00:08:10.530,00:08:11.690,"If you were a bit stupider,"
00:08:13.110,00:08:13.900,再丑一点,00:08:13.110,00:08:13.960,"uglier,"
00:08:14.740,00:08:16.230,不那么温柔懂事,00:08:14.740,00:08:16.480,"and less good-natured and sensible,"
00:08:16.910,00:08:18.820,朕或许就看得上她了,00:08:16.910,00:08:18.820,then I might be able to put up with her.
00:08:19.540,00:08:22.070,人都说新欢旧爱左右逢源,00:08:19.540,00:08:22.070,"One can have affection for both the
newly favored and the long-beloved."
00:08:22.580,00:08:24.160,怎么就皇上这么偏心呢,00:08:22.580,00:08:24.400,Why is your heart one-sided?
00:08:25.000,00:08:26.830,祺嫔的性子是要强了些,00:08:25.000,00:08:26.830,"It's true that Concubine Délice is willful by nature,"
00:08:27.170,00:08:28.750,但也不轻易报病喊痛的,00:08:27.170,00:08:28.920,but she wouldn't claim to be sick just for attention.
00:08:29.380,00:08:30.540,不如皇上去看看,00:08:29.380,00:08:30.800,Perhaps Your Majesty should go and visit her?
00:08:31.380,00:08:32.710,臣妾陪着皇上走走,00:08:31.380,00:08:33.880,"I will accompany Your Majesty;
a light walk aids digestion."
00:08:33.050,00:08:33.910,就当是消食了,,,
00:08:37.800,00:08:39.090,谁说皇上不来瞧本宫的,00:08:37.560,00:08:39.090,Who said His Majesty won't come to see me?
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.090,都是你们这起子贱人调峻,00:08:39.560,00:08:41.390,It's all because of you lot of bitches
00:08:41.390,00:08:43.180,一味地讨好永寿宫来作践本宫,00:08:41.390,00:08:44.036,"currying favor with the Palace of Eternal Longevity
to undermine my status!"
00:08:53.900,00:08:55.770,大胆皇上小心皇上在此,00:08:53.900,00:08:56.120,"- How dare you! His Majesty is here.
- Careful, Your Majesty."
00:08:57.910,00:08:59.610,皇上金安,00:08:57.910,00:08:59.610,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:09:02.040,00:09:02.870,皇上金安,00:09:02.040,00:09:02.870,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:09:05.210,00:09:06.240,不是说病了吗,00:09:05.210,00:09:06.596,Didn't you say you were sick?
00:09:07.420,00:09:08.910,朕看你精神好得很,00:09:07.420,00:09:09.431,You seem better than ever to me.
00:09:11.760,00:09:12.790,多谢皇上关心,00:09:11.760,00:09:12.790,I thank Your Majesty.
00:09:13.550,00:09:15.160,臣妾适才管教下人,00:09:13.550,00:09:15.160,I was just disciplining the servants.
00:09:16.340,00:09:17.710,臣妾是病了,00:09:16.340,00:09:17.710,I truly am sick ....
00:09:18.010,00:09:19.130,病了不好好将养着,00:09:18.010,00:09:20.560,Then why are you beating your maids instead of resting?
00:09:19.510,00:09:20.590,倒在这儿责打宫女,,,
00:09:21.770,00:09:23.600,她犯了什么错 你要这么打她,00:09:21.770,00:09:23.800,What did she do to deserve a beating?
00:09:24.270,00:09:26.100,她无视臣妾 以下犯上,00:09:24.110,00:09:26.541,I am her master and she defied me!
00:09:27.150,00:09:29.230,臣妾气急了才打了她两下,00:09:27.040,00:09:29.600,I got infuriated and hit her.
00:09:29.900,00:09:30.560,你说,00:09:29.800,00:09:30.960,Tell me what happened.
00:09:30.980,00:09:33.470,祺嫔打的是臣妾的宫女佩儿,00:09:30.980,00:09:33.470,Concubine Délice was beating my maid Violet.
00:09:34.190,00:09:36.030,方才她叫人去请皇上,00:09:34.190,00:09:36.200,She sent someone to request that Your Majesty visit
00:09:36.400,00:09:37.190,皇上不来,00:09:36.400,00:09:37.940,but Your Majesty couldn't come.
00:09:37.530,00:09:40.270,所以她就拿佩儿出气,00:09:37.940,00:09:40.320,So she took it out on Violet.
00:09:45.460,00:09:46.160,佩儿,00:09:45.460,00:09:46.383,Violet.
00:09:46.620,00:09:47.280,奴婢在,00:09:46.620,00:09:47.280,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:09:47.500,00:09:49.290,方才是你去养心殿请朕的吗,00:09:47.500,00:09:49.780,"Was it you who went to the Hall
of Mental Cultivation to find me?"
00:09:50.130,00:09:50.870,回禀皇上,00:09:50.130,00:09:51.000,"Your Majesty,"
00:09:51.630,00:09:52.460,不是奴婢,00:09:51.630,00:09:52.460,"it was not me,"
00:09:53.300,00:09:55.250,是娘娘身边的景泰,00:09:53.300,00:09:55.250,but Her Highness's maid Jingtai.
00:09:55.760,00:09:57.170,既不是她去请的朕,00:09:55.760,00:09:57.437,"She wasn't the one who came to request me,"
00:09:58.130,00:09:59.470,你拿她出气做什么,00:09:58.130,00:09:59.470,why did you take it out on her?
00:09:59.470,00:10:00.210,臣妾是,00:09:59.470,00:10:00.210,Because -
00:10:00.300,00:10:01.960,因为佩儿从前服侍过熹妃,00:10:00.300,00:10:02.120,Because Violet used to serve Consort Lumière.
00:10:02.970,00:10:04.680,熹妃自从有了身孕以后,00:10:02.970,00:10:05.120,Concubine Délice has been holding a grudge
00:10:05.230,00:10:06.590,祺嫔就一直怨恨,00:10:05.400,00:10:07.060,ever since Consort Lumière got pregnant.
00:10:07.060,00:10:09.600,所以她就经常拿佩儿出气,00:10:07.060,00:10:09.600,So she often vents her anger on Violet.
00:10:09.980,00:10:11.060,你竟敢诽言旁本宫,00:10:10.000,00:10:11.258,How dare you slander me!
00:10:13.440,00:10:15.020,你抬起头来,00:10:13.440,00:10:15.020,Raise your head.
00:10:17.400,00:10:18.640,是侍奉过熹妃,00:10:17.400,00:10:19.200,"Indeed, you were a servant of Consort Lumière."
00:10:19.240,00:10:22.700,难怪你刚才话里指着永寿宫责骂,00:10:19.240,00:10:22.700,No wonder you blamed the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:10:22.990,00:10:23.730,臣妾不敢,00:10:22.990,00:10:24.086,I would not dare.
00:10:24.790,00:10:26.070,责打无罪宫女,00:10:24.790,00:10:27.880,Beating an innocent maid - you have no human compassion.
00:10:26.660,00:10:27.900,毫无怜悯之心,,,
00:10:28.870,00:10:31.210,忌妒熹妃有孕以下犯上,00:10:28.590,00:10:31.623,"You envy Consort Lumière's pregnancy,
an offense against your superior."
00:10:32.090,00:10:34.370,又因朕不来而迁怒旁人,00:10:32.090,00:10:35.089,"And because I did not come,
you lashed out at others"
00:10:35.340,00:10:36.950,实则是怨怼于朕,00:10:35.267,00:10:37.098,out of resentment towards me.
00:10:37.380,00:10:39.340,皇上恕罪皇上恕罪,00:10:37.380,00:10:39.340,"Your Majesty, please forgive me!"
00:10:40.800,00:10:42.880,皇上皇上您瞧,00:10:40.800,00:10:43.200,"Your Majesty, allow me to show you this."
00:10:43.760,00:10:45.800,祺嫔一有什么就拿佩儿出气,00:10:43.760,00:10:46.063,Concubine Délice punishes Violet whenever she is displeased.
00:10:46.640,00:10:48.970,您看给她身上打得,00:10:46.640,00:10:48.970,Look at her wounds.
00:10:49.390,00:10:50.800,一块好地儿都没有,00:10:49.506,00:10:51.142,Not even an inch on her has been spared!
00:10:51.690,00:10:52.600,臣妾无用,00:10:51.502,00:10:53.001,I have been powerless to save her.
00:10:53.520,00:10:56.140,她日日以嫔位的身份来压臣妾,00:10:53.520,00:10:56.140,Concubine Délice constantly uses her rank to oppress me.
00:10:56.400,00:10:59.230,臣妾连自己的奴婢都不能救啊,00:10:56.400,00:10:59.230,I cannot even protect my own maid.
00:10:59.950,00:11:00.650,嫔位,00:10:59.950,00:11:00.800,Her rank?
00:11:01.700,00:11:03.980,她这个样子配得上一宫的主位吗,00:11:01.700,00:11:04.544,Does she even deserve to be the head of a palace?
00:11:09.660,00:11:13.700,瓜尔佳氏目无尊上,00:11:09.660,00:11:14.000,Gūwalgiya has no respect for her superior.
00:11:15.550,00:11:16.630,着降为贵人,00:11:15.584,00:11:17.340,She is to be demoted to Noble Lady.
00:11:17.340,00:11:18.120,皇上,00:11:17.340,00:11:18.280,Your Majesty!
00:11:18.420,00:11:19.580,迁居交芦馆,,,
00:11:20.800,00:11:22.290,即日起闭门思过,00:11:18.420,00:11:22.800,"She is to move to the Pavilion of Twining Reeds
and will reflect on herself in confinement."
00:11:22.970,00:11:25.260,无朕的旨意不得出宫一步,00:11:22.880,00:11:25.661,She shall not leave the pavilion without my decree.
00:11:26.310,00:11:29.010,储秀宫的事交由欣贵人主理,00:11:26.310,00:11:29.010,Lady Joie will be in charge of the Palace of Gathering Excellence.
00:11:29.560,00:11:30.420,多谢皇上,00:11:29.560,00:11:30.600,I thank your Majesty.
00:11:30.730,00:11:31.890,皇上 求求你,,,
00:11:32.310,00:11:33.180,皇上 不要,00:11:30.730,00:11:33.880,"Your Majesty, no! Please!"
00:11:38.740,00:11:40.150,太后万福金安,00:11:38.740,00:11:40.240,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:11:40.990,00:11:41.730,起来吧,00:11:40.990,00:11:41.730,Rise.
00:11:42.410,00:11:43.240,谢太后,00:11:42.410,00:11:43.360,I thank your Majesty.
00:11:43.620,00:11:44.320,快,00:11:43.620,00:11:44.360,Quickly.
00:11:46.200,00:11:48.160,太后的气色看着好些了,00:11:46.200,00:11:48.160,Your Majesty looks better today.
00:11:49.870,00:11:51.580,天天喝这么些苦药,00:11:49.870,00:11:53.560,"The bitter medicine I drink every day
makes my face red."
00:11:52.000,00:11:53.360,喝得脸色都红了,,,
00:11:54.080,00:11:56.540,身子再不好看着气色也好,00:11:54.080,00:11:56.892,The blush it gives me makes me seem healthier than I really am.
00:11:56.880,00:11:57.870,都是哄人的,00:11:56.892,00:11:58.892,It's deceptive.
00:11:59.090,00:12:02.580,皇帝你看熹妃咸懂规矩了,00:11:59.090,00:12:02.580,"Emperor, look at how well-mannered Consort Lumière is."
00:12:03.220,00:12:05.000,哀家跟她说了多少次了,,,
00:12:05.600,00:12:07.550,有了身孕就可以免了礼,00:12:03.220,00:12:07.680,"I've told her many times that she's exempt
 from bowing because she's pregnant."
00:12:08.010,00:12:09.000,她偏不听,00:12:08.010,00:12:09.200,But she never listens.
00:12:09.430,00:12:11.090,熹妃对皇额娘的孝心,00:12:09.430,00:12:12.757,"Consort Lumière's filial piety for you
is equal to my own."
00:12:11.430,00:12:12.550,跟儿子是一样的,,,
00:12:14.230,00:12:15.510,你挺着肚子不方便,00:12:14.230,00:12:16.920,"It's quite difficult for you to walk about while pregnant.
Why did you come out?"
00:12:15.860,00:12:16.590,怎么还出来呢,,,
00:12:17.690,00:12:19.430,熹妃的肚子看起来,,,
00:12:19.940,00:12:23.110,要比寻常快五个月的肚子大些,00:12:17.690,00:12:23.400,"Consort Lumière's belly at five months
seems to be larger than other concubines'."
00:12:23.610,00:12:24.440,太医说,,,
00:12:26.160,00:12:27.490,月夏中有双生胎,00:12:23.610,00:12:27.440,The imperial doctors say I'm pregnant with twins.
00:12:28.080,00:12:29.530,所以肚子格外大些,00:12:28.080,00:12:29.920,That's why my belly is especially big.
00:12:31.160,00:12:32.870,嬛嬛你说的可是真的,00:12:31.160,00:12:32.870,"Huan Huan, truly?"
00:12:34.080,00:12:36.290,温太医所言臣妾不敢妄言,00:12:34.080,00:12:36.557,"That's what Dr. Wen said.
I wouldn't say it otherwise."
00:12:36.960,00:12:39.700,温太医的医术想必不会有错,00:12:36.960,00:12:39.700,"Given Dr. Wen's skills, it must be true."
00:12:43.760,00:12:45.040,这样大的喜事,00:12:43.760,00:12:45.160,"This is splendid news,"
00:12:46.140,00:12:48.720,朕该昭告天下才是,00:12:46.140,00:12:48.720,I should announce it to all under Heaven.
00:12:49.390,00:12:51.850,臣妾能再服侍皇上左右已是万幸,00:12:49.390,00:12:52.000,"I am already blessed to serve by Your Majesty's side,"
00:12:52.430,00:12:53.670,怎敢以腹中之子,,,
00:12:53.980,00:12:55.340,而得昭告天下之幸,,,
00:12:55.690,00:12:58.180,如此荣宠 臣妾万万不敢承受,00:12:52.430,00:12:58.845,"I dare not bear the honor of such an announcement
on account of my pregnancy."
00:12:59.730,00:13:01.140,熹妃很是懂事,00:12:59.730,00:13:01.318,Consort Lumière is very sensible.
00:13:02.570,00:13:03.680,臣妾刚回宫中,00:13:02.570,00:13:03.880,"I've just returned to the palace,"
00:13:04.360,00:13:06.570,不想因一己之事而多生事端,00:13:04.360,00:13:06.570,and I would not want to cause any disturbance.
00:13:07.280,00:13:08.690,也想好好安静养胎,,,
00:13:09.660,00:13:11.070,免受来往恭贺之扰,00:13:07.280,00:13:11.680,"I wish to carry the pregnancy in peace,
without visitors bringing their good wishes."
00:13:12.080,00:13:15.540,因而臣妾怀有双生胎之事,00:13:12.080,00:13:15.540,"So, as for my pregnancy with twins,"
00:13:16.120,00:13:17.460,在瓜熟蒂落之前,00:13:16.120,00:13:17.950,"until the ""melon is ripe for picking"","
00:13:18.290,00:13:19.500,愿无第四人知晓,00:13:18.290,00:13:20.000,I hope it can be kept among us.
00:13:21.090,00:13:25.920,六宫皆晓对熹妃安胎也未合适,00:13:21.090,00:13:25.920,"If the harem were to learn of this, it would not be conducive to
a peaceful environment for Consort Lumière."
00:13:27.180,00:13:30.040,等来日生产之时便都知晓,00:13:27.180,00:13:30.040,"There's no need to reveal the news now,"
00:13:30.680,00:13:31.800,不必急在一时,00:13:30.413,00:13:32.430,they will all know when she gives birth.
00:13:32.430,00:13:35.140,皇额娘你和熹妃都这样说,00:13:32.430,00:13:36.948,"Imperial Mother, I have no objection to
what you and Consort Lumière suggest."
00:13:35.230,00:13:36.590,儿子自然没有异议,,,
00:13:37.940,00:13:38.770,只是,00:13:37.940,00:13:39.360,Only...
00:13:40.270,00:13:43.310,如此欢喜之事无人同庆,00:13:39.760,00:13:44.521,"It is a shame that we cannot celebrate
such a joyous event with others."
00:13:43.740,00:13:44.650,真是可惜,,,
00:13:45.280,00:13:46.610,若真如太医所言,00:13:45.280,00:13:46.610,"If the Imperial Doctor is right,"
00:13:46.900,00:13:48.740,皇上还怕没有庆贺之日吗,00:13:46.900,00:13:49.461,"then there will be plenty of time to
celebrate with Your Majesty afterwards."
00:13:50.410,00:13:51.610,熹妃说得是,00:13:50.410,00:13:51.788,Consort Lumière is right.
00:13:52.040,00:13:54.120,只是熹妃有着双生胎,00:13:52.040,00:13:54.387,"Since Consort Lumière is pregnant with twins now,"
00:13:54.950,00:13:56.910,伺候皇上就更不方便了,00:13:54.950,00:13:57.177,it will be inconvenient for her to serve the Emperor.
00:13:58.040,00:14:00.250,其实与熹妃交好的嫔妃中,00:13:58.040,00:14:00.250," Among the concubines close with Consort Lumière,"
00:14:01.000,00:14:02.870,多有贤惠温和之人,00:14:01.000,00:14:03.182,there are many virtuous and gentle ones.
00:14:03.920,00:14:06.210,皇上何不让熹妃好好休息,00:14:03.920,00:14:06.210,I suggest you let Consort Lumière rest well
00:14:06.550,00:14:07.790,由她们伺候着,00:14:06.550,00:14:08.351,and allow the others to serve you.
00:14:08.720,00:14:09.800,依额娘看,00:14:08.720,00:14:09.880,"If you ask me,"
00:14:10.140,00:14:13.090,惠嫔端庄纯孝 就好得很,00:14:10.140,00:14:13.811,I'd recommend Consort Vertu for her decorum and filial devotion.
00:14:14.850,00:14:16.890,儿子谨遵皇额娘教诲,00:14:14.850,00:14:17.251,"I obey your advice, Imperial Mother."
00:14:18.850,00:14:21.970,还有皇后病虽不重,00:14:18.850,00:14:21.970,"Regarding the Empress's illness,"
00:14:22.570,00:14:24.060,却一直未能痊愈,00:14:22.040,00:14:24.537,"although it's not severe, it still has not been cured."
00:14:24.980,00:14:27.100,不如请钦天监看看,00:14:24.980,00:14:27.461,Why not consult the Astrological Office
00:14:27.650,00:14:28.980,到底是怎么回事,00:14:27.650,00:14:29.741,to see if there is a reason?
00:14:31.030,00:14:33.740,再让宝华殿诵经祈福,00:14:31.030,00:14:33.740,And have Baohua Hall pray for her recovery.
00:14:34.160,00:14:34.770,是,00:14:34.160,00:14:34.770,Yes.
00:14:46.340,00:14:48.880,启禀皇上钦天监副使到了,00:14:46.340,00:14:48.880,"Your Majesty, the Deputy Astrological Official is here."
00:14:50.840,00:14:54.130,微臣钦天监副使叩见皇上万岁,00:14:50.840,00:14:54.130,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:14:54.890,00:14:56.600,怎么是你来正使呢,00:14:54.890,00:14:56.600,Why are you here? Where is the Head Official?
00:14:57.270,00:14:59.300,正使抱恙不能面圣,00:14:57.226,00:14:59.600,"The Head Official is sick and unable to come,"
00:15:00.520,00:15:02.980,故遣微臣来此面见皇上,00:15:00.520,00:15:02.980,so he sent me on his behalf.
00:15:03.650,00:15:04.260,也罢,00:15:03.650,00:15:04.440,That's fine.
00:15:05.610,00:15:07.690,朕此番召你前来,00:15:05.610,00:15:07.690,I called you here today
00:15:09.030,00:15:11.940,是想问先前危月燕冲月一事,00:15:09.030,00:15:12.563,"to ask about the previous event of
""Roof mansion impinging on the Moon"""
00:15:13.410,00:15:14.400,事隔数月,00:15:13.410,00:15:14.780,"In the past few months,"
00:15:14.780,00:15:17.320,不知天象有什么变数吗,00:15:14.780,00:15:17.320,has there been any change in the Heavens?
00:15:17.580,00:15:20.070,危月燕冲月乃是数月前的天象,00:15:17.580,00:15:20.070,The Rooftop mansion impinged on the moon several months ago.
00:15:20.330,00:15:22.660,这数月内风水转变日月更替,00:15:20.330,00:15:22.880,"Since then, the signs of Heaven have changed
with the alternating Sun and Moon."
00:15:22.920,00:15:24.660,危月燕星隐隐可见紫光,00:15:22.920,00:15:24.760,"The Roof mansion glows faintly purple,"
00:15:25.000,00:15:26.120,大有祥和之气,00:15:25.000,00:15:26.360,which emanates harmonious qi.
00:15:26.590,00:15:28.450,已过冲月之凌厉星象,00:15:26.590,00:15:28.450,Portents of aggression have now passed.
00:15:29.130,00:15:30.120,果真如此吗,00:15:29.130,00:15:30.240,Really?
00:15:31.050,00:15:35.090,为何皇后和太后依旧缠绵病榻,00:15:31.050,00:15:35.090,Then why are the Empress and the Empress Dowager still sick?
00:15:36.560,00:15:38.510,而钦天监正使,00:15:36.560,00:15:38.510,And why didn’t the Head Official
00:15:39.180,00:15:41.720,又为何不早早禀明此事,00:15:39.180,00:15:41.720,report this to me sooner?
00:15:41.940,00:15:42.890,皇上可曾听闻,00:15:41.940,00:15:43.160,Your Majesty may have heard the saying:
00:15:43.190,00:15:44.550,在其位而谋其事,00:15:43.190,00:15:44.920,"""Positions are defined by their duties."""
00:15:45.020,00:15:46.060,而微臣则认为,00:15:45.020,00:15:46.060,"But I have seen that,"
00:15:46.440,00:15:48.480,言某其事才可保其位,00:15:46.160,00:15:48.560,newly invented duties can bolster a position.
00:15:48.730,00:15:49.810,正因天象不吉,,,
00:15:50.110,00:15:51.730,皇上才会依赖钦天监,00:15:48.730,00:15:52.280,"Your Majesty counts on the Astrological Office
when there are inauspicious signs."
00:15:52.280,00:15:54.070,正使才会有俸禄可食,00:15:52.280,00:15:54.480,The Head Official is therefore granted both authority
00:15:54.410,00:15:55.440,有威势可仗,00:15:54.480,00:15:56.080,and ... a stipend.
00:15:56.080,00:15:57.530,若天象从来平和,00:15:56.080,00:15:57.760,"If the astronomical phenomena were always peaceful,"
00:15:57.830,00:16:00.320,皇上又怎会想起钦天监呢,00:15:57.830,00:16:00.320,Your Majesty would not need to rely on the Astrological Office.
00:16:00.910,00:16:03.660,你似乎很懂得为官不正之道啊,00:16:00.910,00:16:03.660,You seem to know a lot about the corrupt ways to be an official.
00:16:04.420,00:16:07.160,微臣懂得却不以为然,00:16:04.420,00:16:07.160,"I know them well, but I don’t agree with them."
00:16:08.300,00:16:10.960,臣有一事不知当说不当说,00:16:08.300,00:16:10.960,"There's something, I don't know whether I should say it."
00:16:11.220,00:16:12.000,说来听听,00:16:11.220,00:16:12.200,Say it.
00:16:12.340,00:16:13.580,太后厄运虽解,00:16:12.340,00:16:13.880,The ill omen for the Empress Dowager has abated.
00:16:13.890,00:16:15.250,然而臣夜观星象,00:16:13.890,00:16:15.428,But I observed something at night.
00:16:15.640,00:16:17.720,前朱雀七星中井木讦,,,
00:16:17.970,00:16:20.260,与金鬼羊二星隐隐发黑,00:16:15.640,00:16:20.160,"Of the seven stars of the Vermilion Bird,
the Well and the Ghost mansions have slightly darkened."
00:16:20.600,00:16:21.680,此二星为凶星,00:16:20.600,00:16:21.980,These are two inauspicious stars.
00:16:21.980,00:16:23.890,主惊吓一切所求皆不利,00:16:21.980,00:16:24.202,"They are the lords of terror, and will frustrate one's wishes."
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.850,朱雀七宿主南方,00:16:24.400,00:16:27.486,"The Vermilion Bird commands the south,
as a guardian of the Imperial Garden."
00:16:26.150,00:16:27.260,正对御花园南侧,,,
00:16:27.770,00:16:28.640,微臣多嘴,00:16:27.770,00:16:28.800,"If I may ask,"
00:16:29.530,00:16:31.610,可有哪位娘娘小主的双亲,00:16:29.530,00:16:31.610,Does any concubine have a parent
00:16:31.940,00:16:32.900,姓中带木,00:16:31.680,00:16:33.200,surnamed with a 木 [wood] radical?
00:16:33.200,00:16:35.190,近日又有惊吓和灾厄,00:16:33.200,00:16:35.360,This concubine would have experienced a misfortune recently.
00:16:36.780,00:16:42.320,御花园南角宫宇不少啊,00:16:36.780,00:16:39.526,There are a lot of palaces to the south...
,,,00:16:40.594,00:16:42.765,of the Imperial Garden.
00:16:43.620,00:16:44.450,延示喜宫,00:16:43.620,00:16:44.940,"The Palace of Prolonging Happiness,"
00:16:45.580,00:16:46.370,景仁宫,00:16:45.580,00:16:46.860,"the Palace of Great Benevolence,"
00:16:47.460,00:16:48.420,永寿宫,00:16:47.460,00:16:48.776,the Palace of Longevity...
00:16:49.750,00:16:50.540,都在那儿,00:16:49.750,00:16:50.807,They are all there.
00:16:51.760,00:16:54.960,只是这双亲名中带木的,00:16:51.760,00:16:54.960,Regarding a parent's surname with the 木 radical...
00:16:55.180,00:16:55.760,苏培盛,00:16:55.180,00:16:56.250,Su Peisheng.
00:16:56.800,00:16:57.510,禀皇上,00:16:56.800,00:16:57.510,Your Majesty.
00:16:58.430,00:16:59.540,据奴才所知,00:16:58.430,00:16:59.540,"As far as I know,"
00:17:00.390,00:17:03.130,只有安嫔娘娘的生母是姓林的,00:17:00.390,00:17:03.600,Concubine An’s mother is surnamed 林 [forest].
00:17:03.600,00:17:05.840,其余容奴才再去查一查,00:17:03.600,00:17:06.020,I'll check on the other concubines to be sure.
00:17:06.020,00:17:09.060,罢了你只说要怎么做,00:17:06.020,00:17:09.060,It's all right. Just tell me what to do.
00:17:09.480,00:17:10.390,并无大不妥,00:17:09.480,00:17:10.720,It is not a serious matter.
00:17:10.900,00:17:13.560,只是星宿不利恐生不祥之事,00:17:10.760,00:17:13.560,"But, the constellation is unfavorable
and may give rise to inauspicious events."
00:17:13.860,00:17:15.150,还请静修为宜,00:17:13.560,00:17:15.490,It's best for the concubine to avoid seeing others.
00:17:15.490,00:17:16.650,只静修便可,00:17:15.490,00:17:17.490,Just not seeing others is enough?
00:17:17.490,00:17:20.400,皇上皇后娘娘久病缠绵,00:17:17.490,00:17:20.400,"During Her Majesty the Empress's prolonged illness,"
00:17:20.830,00:17:21.690,奴才听闻,00:17:20.830,00:17:21.840,I heard that
00:17:22.290,00:17:24.820,一直是由安嫔在近榻侍奉的,00:17:22.392,00:17:24.922,Concubine An has always served by Her Majesty's side.
00:17:25.460,00:17:27.870,久病之人阴虚亏损,00:17:25.460,00:17:28.170,Her Majesty's yin is depleted from the illness.
00:17:28.170,00:17:29.830,安嫔又逢星宿不利,00:17:28.170,00:17:30.170,Now Concubine An is associated with an inauspicious sign.
00:17:30.170,00:17:31.630,不知是否有所冲撞,00:17:30.170,00:17:32.454,It might have worsened Her Majesty's condition.
00:17:33.050,00:17:36.340,皇后卧病一直是安嫔侍奉最多,00:17:33.050,00:17:36.580,Concubine An has been serving the Empress the most.
00:17:37.130,00:17:37.870,如此,00:17:37.130,00:17:37.870,So...
00:17:38.970,00:17:42.340,便叫安嫔不许再进皇后宫中,00:17:38.970,00:17:42.340,"Inform Concubine An that
she is not to enter the Empress’s palace again,"
00:17:43.350,00:17:44.760,静修几日也罢,00:17:42.989,00:17:44.980,and that she should stay in her palace for a few days.
00:17:44.980,00:17:45.640,嗻,00:17:44.980,00:17:45.760,Yes.
00:17:46.690,00:17:48.020,既然有人抱恙,00:17:46.690,00:17:48.200,"Since the Head Official is ill,"
00:17:48.850,00:17:50.140,那么就由你,00:17:48.850,00:17:50.140,why don't you
00:17:50.980,00:17:53.270,接掌钦天监正使一职,00:17:50.980,00:17:53.270,take over his post?
00:17:54.650,00:17:57.020,只是朕还不知道你的名字,00:17:54.650,00:17:57.020,But I still don’t know your name.
00:17:57.570,00:17:58.780,微臣季惟生,00:17:57.570,00:17:59.560,"My name is Ji Weisheng, Your Majesty."

00:18:13.920,00:18:17.040,奴才苏培盛给两位娘娘请安,00:18:13.920,00:18:17.120,Peace to Your Highnesses.
00:18:17.880,00:18:18.590,苏公公,00:18:17.880,00:18:18.590,Mr. Su.
00:18:19.800,00:18:23.470,娘娘皇上今晚宿在了碎玉轩了,00:18:19.800,00:18:23.470,"Your Highness, His Majesty is staying
in the Palace of Pearl Jade tonight."
00:18:23.680,00:18:24.340,真的,00:18:23.680,00:18:24.480,Really?
00:18:24.770,00:18:26.760,原本皇上是要去看富贵人,00:18:24.770,00:18:26.760,His Majesty was going to see Lady Fuca
00:18:27.230,00:18:29.310,走到了门口临时改变主意,00:18:27.230,00:18:29.310,but he had a change of heart when he got to the door
00:18:29.650,00:18:30.810,说要到碎玉轩去,00:18:29.650,00:18:31.040,and said he would go to the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:18:31.230,00:18:31.840,这不,00:18:31.230,00:18:31.920,Indeed.
00:18:32.020,00:18:34.180,皇上正在碎玉轩和惠嫔娘娘,00:18:32.020,00:18:34.180,His Majesty is having dinner and chatting
00:18:34.480,00:18:35.520,用月善说话呢,00:18:34.480,00:18:35.840,with Concubine Vertu now.
00:18:37.490,00:18:39.570,这皇上去碎玉轩已经够稀罕了,00:18:37.490,00:18:39.960,"It is rare for His Majesty to visit the Palace of Pearl Jade,"
00:18:40.030,00:18:40.860,更难得的是,,,
00:18:41.160,00:18:42.570,眉姐姐也肯留着皇上了,00:18:40.030,00:18:42.986,but it's even rarer that Meizhuang is willing to have him.
00:18:43.700,00:18:45.360,皇上去碎玉轩之前,00:18:43.700,00:18:45.360,"Before His Majesty's arrival,"
00:18:45.620,00:18:48.110,太后把惠嫔娘娘召去了寿康宫,00:18:45.400,00:18:50.080,"the Empress Dowager had a long conversation
with Her Highness Concubine Vertu."
00:18:48.410,00:18:49.900,说了好一会子的话呢,,,
00:18:51.080,00:18:54.290,宫里呀没有恩宠便不能存活,00:18:51.080,00:18:55.120,It is difficult to survive in the Palace without His Majesty's favor.
00:18:55.210,00:18:58.700,有太后发话或许惠嫔想通了,00:18:55.210,00:18:58.700,Perhaps the Empress Dowager opened up Concubine Vertu's mind.
00:19:50.180,00:19:52.390,皇上怎么这样看着臣妾,00:19:50.180,00:19:53.360,Why does Your Majesty look at me like that?
00:19:53.850,00:19:55.310,朕许久未见你,00:19:53.850,00:19:56.400,It's been a long time since I looked at you carefully.
00:19:56.570,00:19:57.850,现在仔细看你,,,
00:19:59.650,00:20:01.640,总觉得跟刚入宫的时候,00:19:56.800,00:20:02.640,You look different from when you first entered the Palace.
00:20:01.900,00:20:02.810,有些不同了,,,
00:20:03.530,00:20:06.520,年岁渐长 容颜改变也是有的,00:20:03.400,00:20:06.800,One's appearance changes with the passing of time.
00:20:07.830,00:20:11.240,以前总觉得你大方端和,00:20:07.830,00:20:11.240,I have always thought of you as generous and gentle.
00:20:12.750,00:20:14.080,经过了这些事,00:20:12.750,00:20:14.640,"After all that has happened,"
00:20:15.290,00:20:17.530,才知道你是个有傲气的,00:20:15.290,00:20:18.131,I have realized that you also have your pride.
00:20:19.840,00:20:20.670,朕知道,00:20:19.840,00:20:21.440,I know that
00:20:22.050,00:20:25.130,这些年你总怨着朕,00:20:22.286,00:20:25.640,"these past years, you've been upset with me."
00:20:28.510,00:20:29.470,臣妾不敢,00:20:28.400,00:20:30.600,"Your Majesty, I would not dare."
00:20:31.980,00:20:33.180,你口里说不敢,00:20:31.980,00:20:33.600,"You say that you wouldn't dare,"
00:20:34.650,00:20:36.230,朕问你一句真心话,00:20:34.735,00:20:36.480,but let me ask you this:
00:20:37.570,00:20:38.730,熹妃离宫后,00:20:37.637,00:20:39.132,"After Consort Lumière left,"
00:20:40.150,00:20:41.480,你一直住在这儿,00:20:40.291,00:20:41.929,the reason that you moved here
00:20:42.900,00:20:44.520,不就是为了避开朕吗,00:20:42.975,00:20:45.107,"was to avoid me, wasn't it?"
00:20:50.370,00:20:51.360,朕知道,00:20:50.216,00:20:51.779,"All these years,"
00:20:52.500,00:20:54.450,这些年总是委屈了你,00:20:52.714,00:20:55.135,I know you've been aggrieved.
00:20:56.670,00:20:57.780,可朕是皇上,00:20:56.670,00:20:58.461,"But as the Emperor,"
00:20:59.040,00:21:03.080,有些事不能不保全大局而委屈你,00:20:58.995,00:21:03.384,I had to consider the big picture even if it made you aggrieved.
00:21:05.090,00:21:09.380,更何况有时候朕自己何尝不委屈,00:21:05.090,00:21:09.380,"Sometimes, I even have to make myself aggrieved."
00:21:09.970,00:21:12.010,您是皇上 臣妾不敢委屈,00:21:09.970,00:21:12.611,"Your Majesty is the Emperor,
I would not dare to feel aggrieved."
00:21:13.480,00:21:16.090,皇上您也有您的难处,00:21:13.480,00:21:16.090,Your Majesty has difficulties of your own.
00:21:17.230,00:21:19.720,好在嬛儿也已经回来了,00:21:17.230,00:21:19.720,"Luckily, Huan'er is back."
00:21:21.820,00:21:22.650,朕,00:21:21.800,00:21:22.800,I...
00:21:33.540,00:21:35.120,朕今天跟你说的,00:21:33.000,00:21:37.481,"Every word I've spoken tonight comes from
the bottom of my heart."
00:21:35.410,00:21:36.700,都是掏心窝子的话,,,
00:21:39.000,00:21:40.540,你冷了朕多年,,,
00:21:41.500,00:21:43.210,朕也冷了你多年,00:21:39.000,00:21:43.921,"For years, you were cold towards me and I neglected you."
00:21:44.880,00:21:46.420,其实有时候想想,00:21:44.880,00:21:46.509,"Now I think about it,"
00:21:48.010,00:21:50.090,若不是当年华妃的事,00:21:48.010,00:21:50.240," if it wasn't for what Consort Fleur did,"
00:21:52.390,00:21:55.300,或许朕现在对你,00:21:52.390,00:21:55.701,perhaps I would treat you ...
00:21:57.060,00:21:59.140,也和对熹妃是一样的,00:21:57.304,00:21:59.649,as I treat Consort Lumière now.
00:22:02.730,00:22:04.310,太后今儿个皇上,,,
00:22:04.610,00:22:06.270,总算留在惠嫔那儿了,00:22:02.730,00:22:06.280,"Your Majesty, the Emperor is finally staying at
Concubine Vertu's palace tonight."
00:22:09.160,00:22:10.990,惠嫔是个懂事的好孩子,00:22:09.160,00:22:11.200,Concubine Vertu is a sensible girl.
00:22:12.620,00:22:14.480,皇上过去一直冷落她,00:22:12.620,00:22:14.827,The Emperor has treated her coldly.
00:22:17.160,00:22:18.700,把房中暖情的酒,,,
00:22:19.000,00:22:20.210,给他们送过去一壶,00:22:17.160,00:22:20.742,Bring them some wine that can warm their emotions
00:22:21.170,00:22:23.080,就说是哀家赐给他们的,00:22:20.742,00:22:23.405,and tell them it's a gift from me.
00:22:24.210,00:22:25.000,是,00:22:24.210,00:22:25.000,Yes.
00:22:33.260,00:22:34.850,奴婢给皇上请安,00:22:33.260,00:22:34.850,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:22:35.180,00:22:36.510,给惠嫔娘娘请安,00:22:35.180,00:22:36.644,Peace to Concubine Vertu.
00:22:37.430,00:22:38.840,孙姑姑怎么来了,00:22:37.430,00:22:39.329,"What brings you here, Madam Bamboo?"
00:22:44.400,00:22:47.190,太后听说皇上到惠嫔娘娘这儿来,00:22:44.400,00:22:47.190,"The Empress Dowager was pleased to hear
that Your Majesty is with Concubine Vertu."
00:22:47.440,00:22:49.730,心中高兴 特赐酒一壶,00:22:47.440,00:22:50.000,So she asked me to bring some wine here as a gift.
,,,00:22:50.240,00:22:52.094,Imperial Mother...
00:22:50.240,00:22:54.030,皇额娘这么晚了还想着赐酒,00:22:52.094,00:22:54.876,thought about sending over some wine this late at night.
00:22:57.000,00:22:57.660,什么酒,00:22:57.000,00:22:58.275,What kind of wine?
00:22:58.710,00:23:01.290,皇上跟惠嫔娘娘两情相悦,00:22:58.710,00:23:01.468,"Your Majesty and Concubine Vertu
are enjoying your time and mutual affection."
00:23:01.540,00:23:02.330,这酒当然是,,,
00:23:02.670,00:23:04.830,成全花好月圆的欢喜酒了,00:23:01.468,00:23:05.150,"Naturally, this wine is to help the
""flowers bloom under a waxing moon""."
00:23:07.380,00:23:09.250,有劳皇额娘费心了,00:23:07.380,00:23:10.000,I am grateful for Imperial Mother's thoughtfulness.
00:23:13.180,00:23:14.590,奴婢先行告退,00:23:13.180,00:23:14.724,Allow me to take my leave.
00:23:21.020,00:23:23.230,真到两情相悦时,00:23:21.020,00:23:23.674,"If there was really mutual attraction,"
00:23:25.020,00:23:26.390,也不必费这酒了,00:23:24.619,00:23:26.929,there would be no need for this wine.
00:23:27.900,00:23:29.190,咱们的日子还长,00:23:27.900,00:23:30.000,We still have many days ahead of us.
00:23:31.360,00:23:33.020,什么时候你想通了,00:23:31.360,00:23:33.020,"When you come around,"
00:23:34.780,00:23:35.650,朕再来看你,00:23:34.780,00:23:36.095,I will come and visit you again.
00:23:39.790,00:23:40.700,回养心殿,00:23:39.790,00:23:41.440,Back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:23:44.040,00:23:45.450,皇上回宫,00:23:44.040,00:23:45.450,His Majesty returns.
00:23:47.590,00:23:49.200,皇上扶住了,00:23:47.590,00:23:49.200,Your Majesty... take my arm.
00:23:51.180,00:23:52.710,臣妾恭送皇上,00:23:51.180,00:23:53.391,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:23:59.390,00:24:00.380,你们都出去吧,00:23:59.110,00:24:00.941,You may all leave now.
00:24:01.640,00:24:02.850,小主你喝多了,00:24:01.440,00:24:03.060,"My Lady, you drank so much..."
00:24:03.060,00:24:04.640,别管我都出去,00:24:03.060,00:24:04.960,"It doesn't matter, just leave."
00:24:06.940,00:24:07.810,是,00:24:06.940,00:24:07.899,Yes.
00:24:15.910,00:24:17.440,人心都死了,00:24:15.910,00:24:17.930,"To a heart that has died,"
00:24:18.370,00:24:21.110,还说这些掏心窝子的话做什么,00:24:18.250,00:24:21.511,what's the point of words from the bottom of his heart?
,,,00:24:24.250,00:24:25.753,"Your Majesty,"
00:24:24.250,00:24:28.080,皇上华妃纵然陷害了我,00:24:26.154,00:24:29.042,"it was Consort Fleur who set me up,"
,,,00:24:29.380,00:24:31.256,but it was your actions
00:24:29.380,00:24:33.920,可您的所作所为才真让我寒心哪,00:24:31.701,00:24:34.369,that devastated my heart.
,,,00:25:04.580,00:25:05.400,Even ...
00:25:04.580,00:25:07.870,你看连太后都知道,00:25:06.270,00:25:08.359,Even the Empress Dowager knew
00:25:11.210,00:25:12.580,要有了这酒,00:25:11.210,00:25:12.847,that only this wine
00:25:14.970,00:25:16.750,才能成全咱们,00:25:14.690,00:25:17.280,could grant us fulfillment tonight.
00:25:19.220,00:25:21.090,只要有了这酒,00:25:19.220,00:25:21.090,Her Majesty was certain
00:25:22.310,00:25:25.930,太后就认定我会服侍您,00:25:22.310,00:25:25.930,"that after this wine, I would serve you."
00:25:31.980,00:25:33.850,那我自己的感情呢,00:25:31.780,00:25:34.611,What about my own affection?
00:25:41.200,00:25:42.780,我到底算什么,00:25:41.200,00:25:43.501,What am I to you?
00:25:45.750,00:25:50.960,我自己的感情他知道吗,00:25:45.777,00:25:48.427,Does he even know...
,,,00:25:49.710,00:25:51.283,my feelings?
00:25:55.130,00:25:56.420,他知道了,00:25:55.130,00:25:56.732,"Even if he knew,"
00:25:58.970,00:26:01.710,也不会把我放在心里的吧,00:25:58.770,00:26:02.071,he wouldn't truly care for me in his heart.
00:26:05.930,00:26:07.550,温实初,00:26:05.930,00:26:07.550,Wen Shichu...
00:26:18.950,00:26:20.400,实初,00:26:18.950,00:26:20.400,Shichu...
00:26:23.370,00:26:24.730,小主您是在叫我吗,00:26:23.370,00:26:25.042,"My Lady, were you calling me?"
00:26:25.830,00:26:27.070,温实初,00:26:25.830,00:26:27.070,Wen Shichu...
00:26:30.670,00:26:31.910,小主您喝醉了,00:26:30.670,00:26:32.088,"My Lady, you're drunk."
00:26:32.290,00:26:32.950,您别喝那么多,00:26:32.120,00:26:33.280,Please don't drink so much.
00:26:33.210,00:26:34.870,整天清醒克制又有什么用,00:26:33.360,00:26:35.747,What's the point of being sober and restrained all the time?
00:26:36.220,00:26:38.330,我就不能醉一回吗,00:26:36.220,00:26:38.650,Can't I just get drunk for once?
00:26:41.140,00:26:42.840,温实初,00:26:41.140,00:26:42.840,Wen Shichu...
00:26:44.850,00:26:46.460,奴婢立刻着人去请温大夫,00:26:44.850,00:26:46.800,"I will send for Dr. Wen immediately, My Lady,"
00:26:46.850,00:26:47.710,来为小主醒酒,00:26:46.850,00:26:48.022,to sober you up.
00:26:48.480,00:26:52.310,整日里活得清醒又有什么用,00:26:48.480,00:26:52.808,What's the point of being sober and clear-headed all day?
00:26:55.730,00:26:58.270,我就不能醉一回吗,00:26:55.730,00:26:58.270,Can't I get drunk just once?
00:27:11.500,00:27:12.360,橘皮三钱,00:27:11.650,00:27:14.019,Orange peel:  three maces;
00:27:15.460,00:27:17.250,东阿阿胶一钱,00:27:15.460,00:27:17.250,Ejiao:  one mace;
00:27:19.630,00:27:21.000,师傅这么晚了,00:27:19.630,00:27:21.260,"Master, it's so late."
00:27:21.260,00:27:22.750,您还要为熹妃娘娘挑选药材,00:27:21.260,00:27:22.928,You're still picking herbs for Consort Lumière.
00:27:23.550,00:27:25.010,这不是熹妃娘娘的药材,00:27:23.550,00:27:25.010,This is not for Consort Lumière.
00:27:25.560,00:27:27.300,是惠嫔娘娘一到了夏日,00:27:25.560,00:27:28.502,"It's for Concubine Vertu who suffers from
a poor appetite in the summer heat."
00:27:27.640,00:27:28.470,总是不思饮食,,,
00:27:28.730,00:27:30.680,给她开一些开胄消暑的药,00:27:28.730,00:27:31.201,I'm prescribing some herbs to boost her appetite.
00:27:31.520,00:27:32.130,你都记下了,00:27:31.280,00:27:32.310,You wrote them all down?
00:27:32.310,00:27:32.930,记下了,00:27:32.310,00:27:32.930,Yes.
00:27:33.560,00:27:34.140,卫临啊,00:27:33.560,00:27:34.520,"Wei Lin,"
00:27:34.520,00:27:36.350,以你的医术足可以独当一面了,00:27:34.520,00:27:36.831,"you're skilled enough to be a doctor independently,"
00:27:37.030,00:27:38.270,我还让你做这些小事,00:27:37.030,00:27:38.880,yet I'm still making you do these trivial things.
00:27:38.990,00:27:40.570,主要是因为你心思缜密,00:27:38.990,00:27:40.659,It's because you're meticulous.
00:27:40.900,00:27:42.440,做事情我比较放心啊,00:27:40.900,00:27:42.440,I know I can rely on you.
00:27:45.660,00:27:46.240,温太医,00:27:45.660,00:27:46.240,"Dr. Wen,"
00:27:46.540,00:27:48.070,采月姑姑请您往碎玉轩一趟,00:27:46.540,00:27:48.410,Madam Lunar is asking you to visit the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:27:48.410,00:27:49.150,惠嫔娘娘喝多了,,,
00:27:49.450,00:27:50.440,请您送些解酒药去,00:27:48.410,00:27:50.710,"Concubine Vertu drank too much.
Please send herbs to sober up Her Highness."
00:27:50.710,00:27:51.620,好我马上就来,00:27:50.710,00:27:51.932,I'll go right away.
00:27:56.040,00:27:56.910,师傅急着走啊,00:27:56.040,00:27:57.133,"Master, you're in a hurry."
00:27:57.460,00:27:58.920,那我去替师傅在记档上,00:27:57.460,00:27:58.880,I'll write the notes that
00:27:59.260,00:28:00.210,记下您进宫的时辰,00:27:58.920,00:28:00.280,you have left for her Palace.
00:28:00.470,00:28:02.050,好不出一个时辰我也就回来了,00:28:00.470,00:28:02.771,"All right, I'll be back within two hours."
00:28:08.310,00:28:09.340,温大人这,00:28:08.310,00:28:09.518,"Dr. Wen, um..."
00:28:10.390,00:28:11.050,采月姑娘,00:28:10.390,00:28:11.280,"Lunar,"
00:28:11.350,00:28:12.810,你先去把这个醒酒药给煮了,00:28:11.350,00:28:12.810,please go and brew these herbs.
00:28:13.810,00:28:14.430,是,00:28:13.810,00:28:14.786,Yes.
00:28:19.570,00:28:21.650,娘娘娘娘,00:28:19.570,00:28:20.600,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:28:21.079,00:28:22.188,Your Highness...
00:28:22.490,00:28:23.770,您何故喝得这么醉啊,00:28:22.490,00:28:24.291,How come you got so drunk?
00:28:28.450,00:28:29.410,你来了,00:28:28.450,00:28:29.544,You're here.
00:28:32.410,00:28:34.120,从来不喝酒的人,00:28:32.410,00:28:34.120,I usually don't drink.
00:28:34.830,00:28:36.370,偶尔醉了一回,00:28:34.830,00:28:36.370,Seeing me drunk
00:28:37.210,00:28:38.580,吓着你了,00:28:37.210,00:28:38.580,must have startled you.
00:28:39.420,00:28:40.380,酒醉伤身哪,00:28:39.180,00:28:41.120,Getting drunk is bad for your health.
00:28:41.300,00:28:43.510,娘娘您何故这样为难自己啊,00:28:41.300,00:28:43.510,Why did Your Highness do this to yourself?
00:28:44.180,00:28:45.460,惠嫔娘娘,00:28:44.180,00:28:45.460,Your Highness...
00:28:47.050,00:28:49.140,难道我没有自己的名字吗,00:28:47.050,00:28:49.274,Don't I have my own name?
00:28:50.850,00:28:52.310,还是在你眼里,00:28:50.850,00:28:52.310,"Or in your eyes,"
00:28:53.190,00:28:54.470,我只是个娘娘,00:28:52.910,00:28:55.031,"am I just ""Her Highness""?"
00:28:55.600,00:28:58.690,和后宫的女人都没什么两样,00:28:55.600,00:28:58.690,Just like any other woman in the harem?
00:29:00.030,00:29:03.690,成天地看着皇上的脸色哭,00:29:00.030,00:29:03.690,"Spending all day crying over the Emperor's frown,"
00:29:04.820,00:29:06.940,看着皇上的脸色笑,00:29:04.820,00:29:07.260,and laughing for the Emperor's smile.
00:29:08.160,00:29:09.820,娘娘我,00:29:08.160,00:29:09.820,"Your Highness, I..."
00:29:11.330,00:29:12.280,您别这么说,00:29:11.130,00:29:12.801,Please don't say that...
00:29:17.210,00:29:18.160,你坐吧,00:29:17.210,00:29:18.561,Have a seat.
00:29:19.420,00:29:20.030,是,00:29:19.420,00:29:20.297,Yes.
00:29:21.920,00:29:23.580,这儿有一壶好酒,00:29:21.600,00:29:24.141,I have some good wine.
00:29:25.550,00:29:27.040,你也喝一口,00:29:25.550,00:29:27.040,You should try some.
00:29:28.390,00:29:29.720,娘娘微臣不敢,00:29:28.390,00:29:30.000,"Your Highness, I would not dare."
00:29:30.390,00:29:32.550,微臣已经把醒酒药交给采月了,00:29:30.390,00:29:32.862,I have given Lunar the herbs to treat intoxication.
00:29:33.520,00:29:35.050,微臣太医院还有事,00:29:33.520,00:29:37.650,"Other matters await me in the Imperial Infirmary.
Forgive me, it's not convenient for me to stay here this late."
00:29:35.390,00:29:37.130,夜深不便请娘娘谅解,00:29:37.650,00:29:39.152,So it turns out...
00:29:37.650,00:29:41.690,原来我连个说话喝酒的人,00:29:39.152,00:29:43.831,I don't even have someone to drink and chat with.
00:29:42.320,00:29:43.230,都找不到了,,,
00:29:44.860,00:29:45.570,娘娘,00:29:44.860,00:29:46.015,Your Highness...
00:29:47.610,00:29:48.690,微微臣,00:29:47.610,00:29:48.690,I...
00:29:49.410,00:29:50.400,微臣遵命便是,00:29:49.410,00:29:50.623,I obey your order.
00:29:56.710,00:29:59.290,人人都说喝了酒高兴,00:29:56.710,00:29:59.290,"Everyone says you get happy when you drink,"
00:30:00.420,00:30:04.460,可是我喝了酒还是觉得孤零零的,00:30:00.420,00:30:04.460,but I still feel so lonely.
00:30:05.880,00:30:09.500,这个宫里皇上不像皇上,00:30:05.880,00:30:09.500,"In the palace, the Emperor doesn't act like an emperor,"
00:30:10.470,00:30:12.760,嫔妃也不像嫔妃,00:30:10.470,00:30:12.938,and the concubines don't act like concubines.
00:30:14.140,00:30:15.300,除了嬛儿,00:30:14.140,00:30:15.680,"Except for Huan'er,"
00:30:16.180,00:30:19.050,我总是孤零零的一个人,00:30:16.180,00:30:19.050,I'm always alone with myself.
00:30:20.650,00:30:21.310,娘娘,00:30:20.650,00:30:21.756,Your Highness...
00:30:24.360,00:30:25.140,您别这样,00:30:24.360,00:30:25.680,Please don't be like this.
00:30:25.780,00:30:27.060,我知道娘娘心里难受,00:30:25.780,00:30:27.505,I know Your Highness feels sad.
00:30:27.700,00:30:30.030,娘娘有什么一应都告诉微臣,00:30:27.700,00:30:30.391,Please tell me what's on your mind.
00:30:30.740,00:30:32.230,微臣听着便是,00:30:30.740,00:30:32.230,I am listening.
00:30:35.330,00:30:36.870,这酒真好啊,00:30:35.330,00:30:36.825,This wine is so good...
00:30:37.750,00:30:41.790,喝了以后身上就暖了,00:30:37.750,00:30:41.790,My body feels so warm now...
00:30:42.290,00:30:47.910,这身子暖了心也就不觉得冷了,00:30:42.290,00:30:47.910,"Since my body is warm, my heart doesn't feel so cold anymore."
00:30:52.220,00:30:55.130,娘娘酒可以暖身也可以伤身哪,00:30:52.220,00:30:55.200,"Your Highness, wine can warm,
but also harm your body."
00:30:55.810,00:30:57.550,娘娘何苦为了一时痛快,00:30:55.810,00:30:57.684,It's not worth harming yourself
00:30:57.890,00:30:59.050,而伤了自己的身体呢,00:30:57.890,00:30:59.531,for a moment of relief.
00:31:01.190,00:31:04.650,你跟我不是一样的人吗,00:31:01.190,00:31:04.960,Aren't you and I the same?
00:31:06.690,00:31:08.900,为了保全想保全的人,00:31:06.690,00:31:08.900,"To protect those we care about,"
00:31:09.650,00:31:10.890,而伤了自己,00:31:09.209,00:31:11.000,we will hurt ourselves.
00:31:13.200,00:31:19.120,我和你不都是一样的吗,00:31:13.200,00:31:19.120,Are we... not the same?
00:31:29.880,00:31:32.840,娘娘与我是知己呀,00:31:29.880,00:31:32.840,"We are kindred spirits, Your Highness."
00:31:46.860,00:31:48.690,知己呀,00:31:46.860,00:31:48.690,Kindred spirits...
00:31:52.820,00:31:54.030,娘娘娘娘,00:31:52.820,00:31:54.386,Your Highness! Your Highness...
00:31:59.660,00:32:00.650,你怎么了,00:31:59.660,00:32:01.011,What's the matter?
00:32:02.750,00:32:03.610,娘娘,00:32:02.750,00:32:03.699,Your Highness...
00:32:34.570,00:32:35.440,停停,00:32:34.570,00:32:35.961,"Stop, stop..."
00:32:36.580,00:32:38.530,小主眼看雨就要下大了,00:32:36.580,00:32:38.530,"My Lady, the rain is getting heavier."
00:32:38.870,00:32:39.980,不如我们进去躲躲吧,00:32:38.530,00:32:40.410,Shall we go inside for shelter?
00:32:40.410,00:32:42.620,雨天路滑若磕了碰了可不好了,00:32:40.410,00:32:42.945,"The road is slippery.
It would be better to avoid slipping."
00:32:43.870,00:32:45.490,好吧扶本宫下来,00:32:43.870,00:32:45.490,"All right, help me get down."
00:32:46.840,00:32:47.490,落轿,00:32:46.840,00:32:48.000,Lower the sedan.
00:33:17.820,00:33:19.440,这合欢花开得真好,00:33:17.160,00:33:19.663,"The ""coupling joy"" flowers are blooming beautifully."
00:33:20.830,00:33:21.780,花开得再好,00:33:20.469,00:33:22.400,"Beautiful as they are,"
00:33:23.460,00:33:26.200,暴雨如注也是要凋零的,00:33:23.460,00:33:26.289,they still all wither in the pouring rain.
00:33:33.340,00:33:34.750,娘娘再往里走一点吧,00:33:33.340,00:33:35.240,"Your Highness, let's go further in."
00:33:35.550,00:33:36.670,这儿寒气太重了,00:33:35.550,00:33:36.890,It's cold and wet here.
00:33:36.890,00:33:37.500,那是谁呀,00:33:36.890,00:33:38.035,Who is that?
00:33:38.850,00:33:40.010,叫她进来躲躲雨吧,00:33:38.850,00:33:40.233,Tell her to come inside.
00:33:40.430,00:33:41.890,奴婢去看看来,00:33:40.430,00:33:41.890,I'll go take a look.
00:33:50.570,00:33:52.270,是富贵人,00:33:50.570,00:33:52.270,Oh! Noble Lady Paix.
00:33:53.030,00:33:54.690,我们娘娘说让你进去躲雨,00:33:52.790,00:33:55.345,Her Highness asks you to take shelter over there.
00:33:59.410,00:34:00.070,快进来,00:33:59.410,00:34:00.426,Come inside.
00:34:01.120,00:34:02.480,娘娘是富贵人,00:34:01.120,00:34:02.792,"Your Highness, it's Noble Lady Paix."
00:34:03.830,00:34:04.610,熹妃万福,00:34:03.830,00:34:05.210,Grace to Consort Lumière.
00:34:05.210,00:34:06.040,身上都是雨,00:34:05.210,00:34:06.557,You're covered with raindrops.
00:34:06.290,00:34:07.400,槿汐给披上衣服,00:34:06.557,00:34:08.273,"Jinxi, put a cloak on her."
00:34:10.340,00:34:12.870,贵人当心身子着凉,00:34:10.340,00:34:12.870,"My Lady, this will keep you warm."
00:34:14.420,00:34:15.880,富贵人喜欢合欢花呢,00:34:14.420,00:34:16.459,"Noble Lady Paix is fond of the ""coupling joy"" flowers."
00:34:17.340,00:34:19.670,不如叫下人铺开布在那树底下,00:34:17.340,00:34:19.670,"Why not ask servants to put
some cloths under the trees?"
00:34:20.100,00:34:21.210,等雨停了去了水,,,
00:34:21.560,00:34:23.090,就可以把花瓣送到你那儿了,00:34:20.100,00:34:23.333,"Then when the rain stops, you can collect the fallen petals."
00:34:23.600,00:34:25.180,这样你也不用自己淋雨,00:34:23.600,00:34:25.661,So you don't need to go out in the rain.
00:34:25.980,00:34:26.760,多谢娘娘,00:34:25.980,00:34:26.760,I thank Your Highness.
00:34:28.270,00:34:29.430,只是快要入秋了,00:34:28.270,00:34:30.280,It's just that it's nearly autumn.
00:34:30.810,00:34:32.900,这合欢花也快不多了,00:34:30.810,00:34:33.381,"There won't be many ""coupling joy"" flowers left."
00:34:34.610,00:34:35.890,御花园中的合欢花,00:34:34.610,00:34:36.291,"These are the most beautiful ""coupling joy"""
00:34:36.650,00:34:37.940,这儿算开得好的了,00:34:36.650,00:34:38.341,in the whole imperial garden.
00:34:39.360,00:34:40.730,这儿的花哪算好啊,00:34:39.360,00:34:40.997,These are the most beautiful ones?
00:34:41.370,00:34:43.610,凝晖堂的合欢花才是天下最佳,00:34:41.370,00:34:43.877,"The ones at the Hall of Converging Light
are the best under Heaven."
00:34:44.120,00:34:46.200,每当入夏时节就如花海一般,00:34:44.120,00:34:46.378,"In early summer, it's like a sea of flowers."
00:34:46.870,00:34:48.490,老远就闻到那个香味了,00:34:46.870,00:34:48.800,You can smell the fragrance from so far away.
00:34:52.670,00:34:53.750,本宫从未见过,00:34:52.918,00:34:54.265,I've never seen it...
00:34:54.590,00:34:56.250,嫔妾从前微贱,00:34:54.590,00:34:56.651,"I come from a humble background,"
00:34:57.010,00:34:58.170,连宫女都尚且不如,00:34:57.010,00:34:58.736,lowlier even than a maid.
00:34:59.090,00:35:00.380,当然可以随便走动了,00:34:59.090,00:35:01.301,That's why I could go anywhere I wanted.
00:35:02.720,00:35:04.300,旁人的闲话是旁人的事,00:35:02.400,00:35:04.701,Others can gossip however they want.
00:35:05.140,00:35:06.510,若自轻自贱便不好了,00:35:05.140,00:35:07.258,Don't think less of yourself because of them.
00:35:08.060,00:35:08.970,若说卑贱,00:35:08.060,00:35:09.663,"Speaking of being humble,"
00:35:09.890,00:35:11.680,本宫又何尝不是罪臣之女呢,00:35:09.890,00:35:11.858,I'm the daughter of a convicted official.
00:35:16.570,00:35:17.270,雨快停了,00:35:16.570,00:35:17.760,The rain is about to stop.
00:35:17.990,00:35:18.820,贵人出门,,,
00:35:19.070,00:35:20.610,怎么身边连个服侍的人都没有,00:35:17.990,00:35:20.934,"Lady Paix, how is it you're out here without a servant?"
00:35:21.870,00:35:22.820,一会儿雨停了,00:35:21.870,00:35:23.000,"When the rain stops,"
00:35:23.160,00:35:24.650,要不要本宫着人送你回去,00:35:23.160,00:35:24.720,shall I have someone escort you back?
00:35:25.870,00:35:28.330,春禧殿向来没有嫔妃愿意踏足,00:35:25.870,00:35:28.440,No concubines have been willing to set foot in the Hall of Spring Joy.
00:35:29.210,00:35:31.490,怎么娘娘愿意贵步临贱地呢,00:35:29.210,00:35:31.600,Would Your Highness be willing to grace such a humble place?
00:35:32.000,00:35:33.330,贵人是不欢迎本宫吗,00:35:32.000,00:35:33.575,Am I welcome?
00:35:44.390,00:35:45.500,给娘娘请安,00:35:44.390,00:35:45.600,Peace to Your Highness.
00:35:48.310,00:35:49.260,请娘娘安,00:35:48.310,00:35:49.280,Peace to Your Highness.
00:35:56.150,00:35:56.890,娘娘坐,00:35:56.150,00:35:57.280,"Please sit, Your Highness."
00:36:06.160,00:36:08.400,贵人的猫养得可真好啊,00:36:06.160,00:36:08.534,"My Lady, your cat is so well behaved."
00:36:09.080,00:36:11.160,这样蠢笨的大猫有什么好看的,00:36:09.080,00:36:11.249,What's so special about this big clumsy cat?
00:36:12.750,00:36:13.450,团绒呢,00:36:12.750,00:36:14.029,Where's Velvet Ball?
00:36:22.970,00:36:26.080,这猫十分乖巧安静,00:36:22.970,00:36:26.080,This cat is very docile and quiet.
00:36:27.060,00:36:28.390,它也是最有灵气的,00:36:27.060,00:36:28.479,It also has a special aura.
00:36:28.970,00:36:30.630,平时从不轻易开口叫p奂,00:36:28.970,00:36:30.630,She rarely meows.
00:36:30.980,00:36:31.810,若开口啊,00:36:30.980,00:36:32.060,"but when she does,"
00:36:32.060,00:36:34.470,这百十里地的猫都能引到近侧,00:36:32.060,00:36:34.470,all the cats are drawn to her from miles away.
00:36:37.270,00:36:38.180,娘娘怕猫啊,00:36:37.270,00:36:38.680,Your Highness is afraid of cats?
00:36:39.400,00:36:40.020,没有,00:36:39.400,00:36:40.200,No.
00:36:40.400,00:36:41.360,本宫只是好奇,00:36:40.400,00:36:41.520,I'm just curious
00:36:42.280,00:36:43.940,你怎么能制服这样的灵兽,00:36:42.080,00:36:44.581,how did you tame such a magical animal?
00:36:47.200,00:36:49.030,嫔妾在做驯马女之前,00:36:47.200,00:36:49.030,"Before I was a horse trainer,"
00:36:49.370,00:36:50.480,是驯兽女出身,00:36:49.370,00:36:50.760,I was a wild animal tamer.
00:36:51.370,00:36:53.200,只怕还驯服不了它吗,00:36:51.370,00:36:53.760,I'm more than capable of taming a cat.
00:36:55.960,00:36:57.420,娘娘吃药的时候到了,00:36:55.960,00:36:57.920,"Your Highness, it's time for your medicine."
00:36:58.170,00:37:00.210,怕是药凉了吃不好,00:36:58.170,00:37:00.480,It's not good to take it cold.
00:37:02.130,00:37:03.460,本宫还得回去服药,00:37:01.729,00:37:03.794,I need to go back and take my medicine.
00:37:04.050,00:37:04.960,不便久留了,00:37:04.050,00:37:05.655,I'm afraid I cannot stay longer.
00:37:08.180,00:37:09.340,方才贵人淋了雨,00:37:08.180,00:37:09.760,"You were soaking in the rain earlier,"
00:37:10.010,00:37:12.100,还得要喝碗热热的姜汤才好,00:37:10.010,00:37:12.145,you should drink some hot ginger soup.
00:37:16.480,00:37:17.590,恭送娘娘,00:37:16.480,00:37:17.640,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:37:28.240,00:37:29.570,把合欢花都收好,00:37:28.240,00:37:30.200,"Put the ""coupling joy"" flowers away carefully."
00:37:30.330,00:37:30.860,是,00:37:30.330,00:37:30.860,Yes.
00:37:32.910,00:37:33.900,吓死奴婢了,00:37:32.910,00:37:34.000,I was scared to death.
00:37:34.790,00:37:35.950,一看到那么大的猫,00:37:34.790,00:37:35.950,Such a big cat.
00:37:36.580,00:37:37.620,奴婢又想起当年,,,
00:37:38.040,00:37:39.030,在斗爱云峰的那个晚上,00:37:36.580,00:37:39.423,It reminded me of that night on Peak Lingyun.
00:37:39.630,00:37:40.620,当真后怕,00:37:39.630,00:37:41.221,That was so scary.
00:37:42.090,00:37:43.200,娘娘没事吧,00:37:42.090,00:37:43.681,Is Your Highness all right?
00:37:44.300,00:37:47.130,没事她不过是养着玩罢了,00:37:44.300,00:37:47.200,It's fine. She just keeps them as pets.
00:37:52.180,00:37:52.920,怎么样,00:37:52.180,00:37:53.400,How is it?
00:37:53.640,00:37:55.220,小厨房新做的豌豆黄,00:37:53.640,00:37:55.487,My kitchen just made these pea flour cakes.
00:37:55.730,00:37:57.590,臣妾尝着倒觉得爽口,00:37:55.730,00:37:57.590,I find them quite refreshing.
00:37:58.480,00:38:00.270,都是按时节做的东西,00:37:58.480,00:38:00.270,Every season has its delicacies.
00:38:00.650,00:38:01.930,朕也吃不出个新鲜来,00:38:00.650,00:38:02.240,It's nothing new.
00:38:03.740,00:38:04.900,皇上惦记新鲜,,,
00:38:05.240,00:38:06.770,所以前些日子去了碎玉轩,00:38:03.740,00:38:07.070,"Did Your Majesty go to the Palace of Pearl Jade
the other day to find something ""new""?"
00:38:07.070,00:38:07.860,你吃醋了,00:38:07.070,00:38:08.320,Are you jealous?
00:38:09.160,00:38:10.400,臣妾是高兴,00:38:09.160,00:38:10.400,I'm happy.
00:38:12.120,00:38:13.450,朕倒不是贪新鲜,00:38:12.120,00:38:14.080,It's not that I crave novelty.
00:38:14.160,00:38:15.700,这些年没去看惠嫔,00:38:14.160,00:38:16.280,I haven't visted Concubine Vertu much these past years.
00:38:16.330,00:38:17.660,心里总觉得对不住她,00:38:16.330,00:38:18.320,I feel I've been unfair to her.
00:38:18.750,00:38:20.910,再加上皇额娘总是催促,00:38:18.750,00:38:21.160,And Imperial Mother always urges me to see her.
00:38:21.750,00:38:22.960,觉得该去看看了,00:38:21.750,00:38:23.441,So I thought it was about time.
,,,00:38:24.210,00:38:25.725,But it turns out
00:38:24.210,00:38:27.330,结果呢 惠嫔对朕还有心结,00:38:25.725,00:38:27.330,"she still has ""a knot in her heart."""
00:38:27.680,00:38:28.380,就走了,00:38:27.680,00:38:28.680,So I left.
00:38:29.470,00:38:31.300,皇上难得去了趟还先走了,00:38:29.470,00:38:31.440,Your Majesty rarely visits yet ended up leaving early.
00:38:31.720,00:38:32.960,得给姐姐赔不是呢,00:38:31.720,00:38:33.080,You need to make it up to Meizhuang.
00:38:33.310,00:38:34.140,朕也想,00:38:33.310,00:38:34.560,I wanted to.
00:38:34.890,00:38:36.180,结果今日再去,00:38:34.890,00:38:36.360,"But when I went to see her today,"
00:38:36.480,00:38:38.220,她说得了风寒不宜面圣,00:38:36.480,00:38:39.101,she said she caught a cold and could not see me.
00:38:38.480,00:38:40.090,这不给朕请出来了,00:38:39.101,00:38:40.711,I was shown out.
00:38:40.770,00:38:41.480,那正好,00:38:40.770,00:38:41.841,"In that case,"
00:38:42.190,00:38:44.520,皇上该拐去延禧宫看看安妹妹呀,00:38:42.190,00:38:44.760,"Your Majesty should go to the Palace
of Prolonging Happiness and see Lingrong."
00:38:45.110,00:38:47.350,以前也不知是怎的,00:38:45.110,00:38:47.681,"I don't know why, but every time"
00:38:48.400,00:38:50.690,一去便似被勾了魂一般,00:38:48.200,00:38:51.000,"I went there, it was as though my soul was captured"
00:38:51.070,00:38:51.980,再不舍得离开,00:38:51.070,00:38:52.550,and I wouldn't want to leave.
00:38:52.910,00:38:55.120,如今长久地不去也就罢了,00:38:52.910,00:38:55.440,"Now that I haven't visited her for quite some time,"
00:38:55.660,00:38:56.650,没怎么想着,00:38:55.660,00:38:57.240,I don't often think about her.
00:38:57.500,00:38:59.410,安妹妹自有她的好处呢,00:38:57.500,00:38:59.410,Lingrong has her merits.
00:39:00.080,00:39:02.570,钦天监说安嫔不祥,00:39:00.080,00:39:03.251,The Astrological Office said that Concubine An is inauspicious.
00:39:03.880,00:39:05.290,朕虽然不忌讳,00:39:03.720,00:39:05.931,"I don't care much about that,"
00:39:06.260,00:39:08.090,到底心里存了个疑影,00:39:06.260,00:39:08.330,but it still cast a shadow in my heart.
00:39:08.680,00:39:10.290,等过些时候再去看她吧,00:39:08.680,00:39:10.800,I'll wait a while before I visit her again.
00:39:11.550,00:39:12.210,对了,00:39:11.550,00:39:12.611,"By the way,"
00:39:13.390,00:39:16.630,朕今日来是想跟你说个事,00:39:13.390,00:39:16.630,I'm here today because I have something to tell you.
00:39:17.100,00:39:17.810,什么,00:39:17.100,00:39:17.960,What is it?
00:39:18.390,00:39:21.230,宫中人心竟然坏到了如此地步,00:39:18.390,00:39:21.230,People in the palace are now so vicious.
00:39:21.860,00:39:23.560,真是令朕难以忍耐,00:39:21.660,00:39:23.840,It's more than I can bear.
00:39:24.110,00:39:25.350,皇上为何这样生气,00:39:24.110,00:39:25.840,What has made Your Highness so angry?
00:39:25.900,00:39:27.810,朕要跟你说了你一定生气,00:39:25.900,00:39:27.880,"If I told you, you'd be angry too."
00:39:31.070,00:39:33.810,臣妾听到的必定比皇上听到的,00:39:31.070,00:39:35.733,"The things I hear are probably
a thousand times uglier than what Your Majesty hears."
00:39:34.200,00:39:35.280,难听百倍千倍,,,
00:39:36.700,00:39:37.820,臣妾都不生气,,,
00:39:38.370,00:39:39.700,皇上更不必生气了,00:39:36.700,00:39:40.263,"If I am not angered, then Your Majesty certainly needn't be."
00:39:41.000,00:39:44.160,朕只是担心你无辜受屈,00:39:41.000,00:39:44.383,I am worried that you might feel aggrieved.
00:39:46.130,00:39:47.790,皇上既然明白臣妾委屈,,,
00:39:48.210,00:39:49.500,那臣妾就不算委屈,00:39:46.130,00:39:50.848,"Since Your Majesty understands my reasons
for feeling aggrieved, I no longer feel such ways."
00:39:50.880,00:39:52.220,皇上说是不堪入耳,00:39:51.050,00:39:52.783,"If what Your Majesty refers to is unbearable to the ear,"
00:39:52.640,00:39:54.880,那就不必入耳更不必上心了,00:39:52.865,00:39:56.038,"there's no need to let it enter your ears,
much less your heart."
00:39:59.230,00:40:03.060,嬛嬛朕从前只觉得你温柔,00:39:59.230,00:40:03.060,"Huan Huan, I had always thought you were just gentle,"
00:40:03.940,00:40:08.850,如今更平添了些平和从容,00:40:03.940,00:40:08.850,now I also see your composure and tolerance.
00:40:09.690,00:40:10.650,人多口杂,00:40:09.210,00:40:11.160,"“Where there are mouths, there is gossip."""
00:40:11.240,00:40:13.440,若真要计较必有株连之祸,00:40:11.292,00:40:14.245,"If I followed every little bit of hearsay,
I'd have a ""string of beads in my hands."""
00:40:15.120,00:40:16.450,臣妾请求皇上,00:40:15.120,00:40:16.720,I entreat Your Majesty:
00:40:17.080,00:40:18.820,无论听到什么听谁说的,00:40:16.840,00:40:19.381,"whatever you hear, whoever it's from,"
00:40:20.200,00:40:21.110,都不要生气,00:40:20.200,00:40:21.200,please don't be angry.
00:40:21.790,00:40:23.120,不要因此责罚六宫,00:40:21.510,00:40:23.601,Please don't punish the harem for it.
00:40:24.380,00:40:25.160,好吧,00:40:24.380,00:40:25.480,All right.
00:40:26.090,00:40:27.000,今儿是十五,00:40:26.090,00:40:27.490,"It's the fifteenth today,"
00:40:27.710,00:40:29.420,皇上得去皇后宫中用晚膳,00:40:27.710,00:40:29.720,Your Majesty will have dinner with the Empress.
00:40:30.170,00:40:32.660,不如早些去别让皇后空等着了,00:40:30.170,00:40:33.200,Don't make Her Majesty wait for you for too long.
00:40:35.550,00:40:38.420,这些都是臣妾小厨房里新做的菜,00:40:35.550,00:40:38.420,These are some new dishes from my kitchen.
00:40:39.560,00:40:40.590,皇上尝尝,00:40:39.560,00:40:40.590,"Taste some, Your Majesty."
00:40:52.650,00:40:53.480,味道不错,00:40:52.650,00:40:53.961,It's good.
00:40:54.610,00:40:56.860,可以和熹妃宫里一比了,00:40:54.410,00:40:57.020,As good as Consort Lumière's kitchen.
00:40:57.280,00:40:58.440,熹妃现在有孕,00:40:57.280,00:40:58.600,Consort Lumière is pregnant.
00:40:58.910,00:41:01.570,饮食上就自然更要精细一些,00:40:58.910,00:41:01.810,It's only natural that she has to be more refined in her diet.
00:41:02.540,00:41:04.400,熹妃怀着身孕辛苦,00:41:02.540,00:41:04.480,It's hard work when she's carrying a baby.
00:41:04.790,00:41:05.950,胄口自然差些,00:41:04.590,00:41:06.311,So she has a decreased appetite.
00:41:06.630,00:41:09.080,东西若不精致 她更不爱吃了,00:41:06.630,00:41:09.561,"If the food wasn't exquisitely made, she would eat even less."
00:41:10.420,00:41:11.630,宫中人人说,00:41:10.420,00:41:11.800,"Everyone in the palace says,"
00:41:12.170,00:41:14.540,熹妃的龙胎跟别人不一样,00:41:12.170,00:41:14.540,Consort Lumière's baby is not like others.
00:41:15.430,00:41:17.340,肚子略微大了一些,00:41:15.430,00:41:17.340,Her belly is bigger than normal.
00:41:18.140,00:41:19.220,皇嗣一事,00:41:18.140,00:41:19.510,"When it comes to imperial heirs,"
00:41:19.510,00:41:21.800,略微谨慎一些也是应该的,00:41:19.510,00:41:21.951,it doesn't hurt to think prudently...
00:41:23.060,00:41:24.090,何出此言呢,00:41:22.820,00:41:24.531,Where did that come from?
00:41:26.270,00:41:27.680,臣妾虽在病中,00:41:26.110,00:41:27.880,"Although I've been unwell,"
00:41:28.270,00:41:30.350,可是宫里的风言风语不断,00:41:28.270,00:41:30.350,I still hear the endless gossip.
00:41:31.190,00:41:32.310,皇后操心,00:41:31.190,00:41:32.960,You pay attention to every concern.
00:41:33.070,00:41:34.730,只是宫里的风言风语,00:41:33.070,00:41:34.730,But gossip in the palace
00:41:35.070,00:41:36.610,从来就没有断过的时候,00:41:35.070,00:41:36.610,"never stops, just like the winds."
00:41:37.570,00:41:38.560,你若是为这些,,,
00:41:38.870,00:41:40.730,不着边际的话费神费心,00:41:37.570,00:41:41.204,"If you waste energy over such baseless rumors,"
00:41:41.410,00:41:43.070,对自身也是无益的,00:41:41.410,00:41:43.511,it'll only end up damaging your health.
00:41:44.710,00:41:47.160,你的身子从来没有好利索过,00:41:44.710,00:41:47.160,You've never fully recovered.
00:41:47.790,00:41:48.660,后宫的事,00:41:47.550,00:41:49.240,Consort Honnête and Consort Estime
00:41:49.130,00:41:51.490,自然有端妃和敬妃为你担着,00:41:49.240,00:41:52.011,have been looking after the palace affairs for you.
00:41:52.380,00:41:54.920,她们没把这些不像样的话听进去,00:41:52.540,00:41:55.612,"They don't take such ridiculous gossip seriously,"
00:41:55.470,00:41:56.630,你又何必理会呢,00:41:55.612,00:41:57.123,so why should you?
00:41:59.550,00:42:01.550,好了 朕饱了,00:41:59.550,00:42:01.550,"All right, I'm full."
00:42:04.020,00:42:05.930,皇上这么晚了还要去哪里呀,00:42:04.020,00:42:06.320,Where is Your Majesty going so late at night?
00:42:07.940,00:42:08.800,回养心殿,00:42:07.940,00:42:09.000,Back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation
00:42:10.150,00:42:10.980,批折子,00:42:09.509,00:42:11.621,to review some memorandums.

[phoenix is the symbol of an empress]"
00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."

but you will never see it.",00:44:33.000,00:44:41.000,"A phoenix about to take flight rustles its wings
but the arc of its flight is unseen."

shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
00:44:51.000,00:45:04.000,The falling leaves from the phoenix tree.,00:44:51.000,00:45:04.000,"The phoenix tree sways in the wind,
shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
