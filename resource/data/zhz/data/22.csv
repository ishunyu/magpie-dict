00:02:21.280,00:02:22.990,娘娘今儿可真是得脸,,,
00:02:23.240,00:02:24.550,皇后在娘娘身边,,,
00:02:24.880,00:02:26.350,简直寒酸得不得了,00:02:22.280,00:02:27.320,"Your Highness gained a lot of favor today.
The Empress looked frumpy sitting next to you."
00:02:28.280,00:02:29.950,皇上虽说要节俭,,,
00:02:30.560,00:02:32.830,可是也不能太不顾脸面,00:02:28.760,00:02:33.340,"Although His Majesty encourages frugality,
the imperial family would lose face if I dress modestly."
00:02:33.640,00:02:36.110,谁不喜欢自己的女人在身边坐着,00:02:33.980,00:02:38.680,Who doesn't like to have their women looking radiant next to them?
00:02:36.520,00:02:37.470,光彩夺目啊,,,
00:02:39.000,00:02:42.110,本宫想着 太后凤体未愈,00:02:39.320,00:02:43.380,I was thinking that Her Majesty the Empress Dowager is still unwell...
00:02:43.120,00:02:45.910,总得送些什么以表孝心,00:02:43.380,00:02:47.000,I should send her something to show my filial piety.
00:02:47.080,00:02:48.830,也好讨她老人家欢心,00:02:47.300,00:02:49.820,It will also lift Her Majesty's spirits.
00:02:49.760,00:02:50.590,这还不容易,,,
00:02:51.040,00:02:52.390,只要银子花下去了,00:02:50.080,00:02:54.120,That's easy. No expense is too great for a worthy present.
00:02:52.760,00:02:54.030,自然就有好东西,,,
00:02:55.440,00:02:58.190,上次本宫举荐给哥哥那几个人,00:02:54.960,00:03:00.380,How much money is left from the gifts given by the people I introduced to my brother?
00:02:58.800,00:03:00.510,他们送来的银子还有多少,,,
00:03:00.720,00:03:01.790,奴婢刚才去看过了,00:03:00.940,00:03:02.700,I went through the account books just now.
00:03:02.440,00:03:03.470,除了赏奴才,,,
00:03:03.760,00:03:06.630,再加上添置首饰衣衫的银子,00:03:02.700,00:03:08.300,"There are still over four thousand taels left
after sending out rewards and purchasing jewelry."
00:03:07.040,00:03:08.430,一共还剩四五千两,,,
00:03:09.280,00:03:10.230,那哪够啊,00:03:09.420,00:03:11.460,That's not enough.
00:03:11.120,00:03:14.470,给太后的东西要送就送最好的,00:03:11.460,00:03:16.340,I have to send Her Majesty the best or nothing.
00:03:15.080,00:03:16.310,否则还不如不送,,,
00:03:17.640,00:03:19.190,若是这个时候,,,
00:03:19.680,00:03:21.390,能凑上来一笔银子就好了,00:03:17.900,00:03:22.520,If only I could get more funds right now.
00:03:23.880,00:03:25.270,奴婢早周宁海说,,,
00:03:25.720,00:03:27.550,有一个人想走娘娘的门头,00:03:24.220,00:03:28.960,Zhou Ninghai said there's someone who has long desired to make your Highness' acquaintance.
00:03:27.880,00:03:28.670,已经很久了,,,
00:03:29.240,00:03:29.950,谁呀,00:03:29.520,00:03:30.880,Who is he?
00:03:30.520,00:03:32.270,上个月被大将军弹劾,,,
00:03:32.520,00:03:34.070,被罢了直隶巡抚的赵之垣,00:03:30.960,00:03:34.440,"Zhao Zhiyuan, the official who was denounced by
the great general and dismissed last month."
00:03:34.320,00:03:35.110,不成,00:03:34.660,00:03:35.980,No.
00:03:35.520,00:03:37.230,赵之垣是哥哥亲口向皇上,,,
00:03:37.640,00:03:38.550,要求罢免的人,00:03:35.980,00:03:39.240,My brother personally spoke against him to his Majesty.
00:03:39.080,00:03:40.870,本宫怎能让他再去见哥哥,00:03:39.240,00:03:41.600,How can I let him meet my brother?
00:03:41.520,00:03:42.470,赵之垣说了,,,
00:03:42.760,00:03:44.630,只要能让他见上大将军一面,00:03:41.760,00:03:46.340,"Zhao Zhiyuan said if he can have a word with the great general,"
00:03:45.000,00:03:45.750,说上一句话,,,
00:03:46.080,00:03:48.150,他就封五万两银子进翊坤宫,00:03:46.340,00:03:48.860,he will send fifty thousand taels to Your Highness.
00:03:48.720,00:03:49.670,若是事成了,,,
00:03:49.920,00:03:51.390,还足足添一倍的银子呢,00:03:49.260,00:03:52.420,He will double the amount if he succeeds.
00:03:53.320,00:03:54.270,好啊,,,
00:03:55.160,00:03:57.150,那就让周宁海把银子收下,00:03:53.860,00:03:59.900,"All right, tell Zhou Ninghai to take
his money and pass forward his name."
00:03:57.680,00:03:59.910,再把赵之垣这个名字告诉哥哥,,,
00:04:00.840,00:04:02.310,本宫倒要看看,,,
00:04:02.560,00:04:05.910,他到底有多大的本事能说动哥哥,00:04:01.260,00:04:06.100,I'll see if how persuasive he is.
00:04:14.760,00:04:15.790,给大将军请安,00:04:15.180,00:04:18.360,Peace to Great General Nian.
00:04:18.160,00:04:20.390,皇上正和果郡王在里边下棋呢,00:04:19.040,00:04:21.560,His Majesty is playing Go with Noble Prince Guo.
00:04:22.880,00:04:24.270,那我就在这儿候着,00:04:23.260,00:04:24.720,I'll wait here.
00:04:24.520,00:04:25.230,是,,,
00:04:25.840,00:04:27.470,那就有劳大将军久候了,00:04:24.740,00:04:28.040,"Yes, thank you for your patience, Great General."
00:04:28.360,00:04:30.910,大将军可否稍稍移驾旁边,00:04:28.740,00:04:32.040,"May I trouble you to move to the side, sir?"
00:04:31.760,00:04:33.990,臣下是不能站在正中的,00:04:32.140,00:04:34.580,Officials cannot stand in the middle.
00:04:34.600,00:04:36.150,我稍等就是了,00:04:34.840,00:04:37.060,I won't be here for very long.
00:04:37.440,00:04:38.110,是,00:04:37.660,00:04:38.840,Yes.
00:04:39.720,00:04:42.630,去取把椅子来请年大将军坐等,00:04:39.800,00:04:42.740,Go get a chair for the great general.
00:04:42.840,00:04:43.470,是,00:04:43.020,00:04:44.440,Yes.
00:04:51.000,00:04:51.670,大将军请,00:04:51.360,00:04:53.520,"Great General, please take a seat."
00:04:55.920,00:04:56.790,再往前挪一点,00:04:56.120,00:04:58.460,Move it a bit forward.
00:05:02.400,00:05:03.270,再挪近一点,00:05:02.820,00:05:04.840,Move a little closer.
00:05:05.400,00:05:06.470,大将军请坐,00:05:05.760,00:05:07.540,"Great general, please sit down."
00:05:14.280,00:05:18.110,你这次去川蜀 一路上可还好吗,00:05:15.920,00:05:19.860,How was your trip to Sichuan?
00:05:20.400,00:05:22.630,风光虽好 人情却冷,00:05:20.260,00:05:23.240,The scenery was beautiful but the people were cold.
00:05:23.600,00:05:24.670,臣弟一头向西,,,
00:05:24.920,00:05:26.030,尤其到了陕甘一带,00:05:23.960,00:05:26.500,I traveled all the way to the west to Shaanxi and Gansu.
00:05:26.600,00:05:29.310,都以年大将军为尊 无有违逆,00:05:26.920,00:05:30.040,The people there showed absolute obedience to General Nian .
00:05:29.960,00:05:31.230,偶尔有一二不服之人,,,
00:05:31.520,00:05:32.430,也很快被压了下来,00:05:30.420,00:05:34.080,All the occasional dissenters had been suppressed quickly.
00:05:32.960,00:05:33.870,并没有什么异议,,,
00:05:46.400,00:05:47.270,皇兄胜了,00:05:46.700,00:05:48.440,You won the game.
00:05:48.640,00:05:50.470,胜得好险,00:05:48.960,00:05:51.260,I only narrowly squeaked by.
00:05:52.680,00:05:53.830,臣弟苦斗良久,,,
00:05:54.160,00:05:55.430,还是落得满盘皆输,00:05:52.860,00:05:55.620,"I fought hard, but still ""lost the full board""."
00:05:55.760,00:05:57.630,早知道便不苟延残喘了,00:05:55.740,00:05:58.180,"I shouldn't have overestimated my ""liberties"" [Go terminology]."
00:05:58.160,00:05:59.710,若是轻而易举取胜,00:05:58.300,00:06:00.920,What's the point of winning easily?
00:06:00.120,00:06:00.950,那还有什么意思,,,
00:06:02.280,00:06:05.750,非得苦心经营大功告成,00:06:02.340,00:06:08.880,It is more interesting to plan painstakingly and finally succeed.
00:06:06.760,00:06:08.870,方才有兴味,,,
00:06:11.120,00:06:13.470,棋艺之道臣弟不如皇兄,00:06:11.500,00:06:14.240,I can't match you at Go.
00:06:14.200,00:06:19.110,治棋局如治朝政讲究制衡之术,00:06:14.460,00:06:19.220,"Go, just like governance, is about checks and balances."
00:06:19.920,00:06:22.590,臣弟只知道进退不懂得制衡,00:06:20.280,00:06:23.680,"I only know about ""invade and defense"" but not balance."
00:06:23.680,00:06:25.230,难怪每次总输给皇兄,00:06:24.120,00:06:26.260,No wonder I lose every time.
00:06:26.760,00:06:28.430,这局就先到这儿了,00:06:27.260,00:06:29.940,This is it for the game.
00:06:30.120,00:06:32.070,臣弟下回再来向皇兄讨教,00:06:30.600,00:06:32.460,I will seek more advice from you next time.
00:06:38.200,00:06:39.030,果郡王好走,00:06:38.480,00:06:40.780,I bid Your Lordship goodbye.
00:06:41.760,00:06:42.550,年大将军,00:06:41.980,00:06:43.760,Great General Nian.
00:06:43.840,00:06:45.470,臣给果郡王请安,00:06:44.100,00:06:46.200,Peace to Your Lordship.
00:06:46.480,00:06:47.630,臣在西北多年,00:06:46.660,00:06:48.280,"After living in the northwest for years,"
00:06:48.040,00:06:50.390,天冷之时足疾便会发作,00:06:48.300,00:06:50.660,my legs ache in cold weather.
00:06:50.760,00:06:52.030,不能起身给王爷请安,00:06:50.681,00:06:52.502,I'm afraid I cannot stand up and bow to Your Lordship properly.
00:06:52.440,00:06:55.230,还望王爷不要见怪,00:06:52.527,00:06:55.496,I seek Your Lordship's forgiveness .
00:06:56.400,00:06:57.150,无妨,00:06:56.660,00:06:57.920,It's all right.
00:06:57.560,00:06:59.150,只要不在御前失仪即可,00:06:57.920,00:07:00.120,Just make sure you show proper manners to His Majesty.
00:07:05.600,00:07:06.270,怎么了,00:07:05.860,00:07:07.340,What's wrong?
00:07:07.240,00:07:08.350,王爷是好脾气,,,
00:07:08.800,00:07:10.430,可奴才的心是肉长的,00:07:07.500,00:07:10.840,"Your Lordship has a good temper, but I don't."
00:07:10.880,00:07:12.310,见不得王爷这么受委屈,00:07:11.140,00:07:12.940,I cannot bear to see Your Lordship being offended.
00:07:12.840,00:07:14.150,他年羹尧此次进京,,,
00:07:14.480,00:07:15.950,文武百官都得远迎跪接,00:07:13.100,00:07:16.220,All officials had to kneel upon his arrival.
00:07:16.480,00:07:18.270,威势显赫可见一斑哪,00:07:16.740,00:07:19.460,You can tell how much power and influence he holds from that.
00:07:19.360,00:07:20.430,况且他和隆科多,,,
00:07:20.800,00:07:21.710,是皇上的左膀右臂,00:07:19.620,00:07:22.340,"He and Long Keduo are like
His Majesty's ""left and right hands""."
00:07:22.280,00:07:23.870,我不过是先帝的遗子之一,00:07:22.540,00:07:25.720,"I'm just a son of the prior Emperor.
Not anyone important to His Majesty."
00:07:24.400,00:07:25.110,算不得什么,,,
00:07:25.640,00:07:27.110,可王爷终究是王爷,00:07:25.900,00:07:27.620,"But Your Lordship is a titled lord,"
00:07:27.600,00:07:29.150,他不过是一奴才,00:07:27.760,00:07:29.600,therefore he is your a servant.
00:07:33.400,00:07:35.390,王爷失势会不如奴才,00:07:33.660,00:07:35.780,A lord out of grace is less than a servant.
00:07:35.840,00:07:37.910,这奴才得势啊 会凌驾于主子,00:07:36.024,00:07:38.310,And a servant in power can lord over the master.
00:07:39.080,00:07:40.070,皇兄登基以来,,,
00:07:40.360,00:07:42.030,对先帝诸子是颇多忌讳,00:07:39.340,00:07:42.660,"Ever since His Majesty acceded to the throne,
he has been very cautious of all of the lords."
00:07:42.520,00:07:44.670,对我已经算是照顾了,00:07:42.780,00:07:45.240,"To me, he has been caring and considerate."
00:07:45.120,00:07:46.350,可年羹尧如此霸道,,,
00:07:46.680,00:07:48.230,奴才就是看不过去,00:07:45.380,00:07:48.520,"But Nian Gengyao is so domineering.
I can't tolerate it."
00:07:48.600,00:07:49.670,淡泊自抑,,,
00:07:50.400,00:07:52.230,才是在皇上身边的生存之道,00:07:48.860,00:07:52.500,"Unobtrusiveness and self-restraint is
the way to survive in His Majesty's court."
00:07:52.400,00:07:52.790,可是,00:07:52.580,00:07:53.200,But...
00:07:53.040,00:07:53.870,不必再说了,00:07:53.280,00:07:54.640,That's enough.
00:07:56.200,00:07:56.870,王爷,,,
00:07:57.160,00:07:58.870,咱们是这个月末去看太妃吗,00:07:56.460,00:07:59.780,"Your Lordship, are we visiting the Consort Dowager
[the Prince's mother] at the end of this month?"
00:07:59.920,00:08:00.870,一切都打点好了,00:08:00.160,00:08:01.620,Is everything ready?
00:08:01.600,00:08:03.750,一切如旧 王爷安心就是,00:08:01.860,00:08:04.340,"Yes, Your Lordship, the same as usual."
00:08:05.200,00:08:06.470,我自抑为额娘,,,
00:08:07.040,00:08:08.430,额娘自抑亦是为我,00:08:05.460,00:08:09.020,"I restrain myself for my mother's well-being,
and she does the same for me."
00:08:10.280,00:08:11.870,阿晋不必再多话了,00:08:10.540,00:08:12.460,"- Talk no more of it, A-Jin.
- Yes."
00:08:12.840,00:08:13.830,臣有罪,,,
00:08:14.120,00:08:17.070,臣认人不清 差点延误军机大事,00:08:13.600,00:08:17.480,I am guilty of misleading Your Majesty due to my poor judgement.
00:08:17.560,00:08:19.350,还请皇上恕罪,00:08:17.820,00:08:19.940,I entreat Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:08:19.920,00:08:22.030,怎么了 起来回话,00:08:20.180,00:08:22.880,What happened? Rise and answer me.
00:08:22.720,00:08:23.230,嗻,00:08:22.980,00:08:24.420,Yes.
00:08:26.080,00:08:27.750,臣上次奏报,,,
00:08:28.080,00:08:30.910,直隶巡抚赵之垣无能昏庸,00:08:26.340,00:08:31.700,"I reported to Your Majesty that the Governor of Zhili, Zhao Zhiyuan, was incompetent and making poor decisions."
00:08:31.600,00:08:34.230,乃是早信了他人的妄言,00:08:31.860,00:08:36.720,He was suspended pending investigation because I believed unfounded rumors.
00:08:34.520,00:08:36.510,致使赵之垣被革职查办,,,
00:08:37.360,00:08:40.750,此次臣又细查了赵之垣的底细,00:08:37.620,00:08:41.260,"After thoroughly investigating his work,"
00:08:41.200,00:08:44.270,发现其确是忠君爱国的可用之人,00:08:41.460,00:08:44.920,I discovered instead that he is loyal and competent.
00:08:45.040,00:08:48.270,赵之垣因臣一言而被无辜革职,00:08:45.300,00:08:50.720,My mistake caused Zhao Zhiyuan to be unfairly dismissed.
00:08:48.600,00:08:49.910,乃是臣之大借,,,
00:08:50.680,00:08:53.950,臣日思夜想心中感愧不安,00:08:50.940,00:08:54.220,I have been reflecting on it in deep remorse
00:08:54.360,00:08:56.870,特来向皇上请罪,00:08:54.620,00:08:58.220,and have come to seek Your Majesty's punishment.
00:08:59.240,00:09:00.630,你也是为朕办事,00:08:59.500,00:09:01.760,You were making a judgement on my behalf.
00:09:01.520,00:09:03.190,事无巨细都要过问,,,
00:09:03.520,00:09:05.110,难免有不周到的地方,00:09:01.780,00:09:06.080,Since you had to attend to everything personally it's understandable that this was overlooked.
00:09:06.160,00:09:08.270,既然赵之垣已被革职,00:09:06.420,00:09:08.600,Since he has already been suspended ...
00:09:08.520,00:09:10.470,赵之垣这等忠正之士,00:09:08.680,00:09:12.480,"If a loyal official like Zhao Zhiyuan is not engaeed by Your Majesty's court,"
00:09:10.720,00:09:14.870,若为朝廷所不用臣寝食难安,00:09:12.480,00:09:15.520,it would be on my conscience when I eat and sleep.
00:09:17.840,00:09:21.430,朕听你之言已将他革职,00:09:18.100,00:09:21.700,I have already dismissed him based on your advice.
00:09:23.120,00:09:26.990,如今即刻再用 朝令夕改,00:09:23.386,00:09:27.256,"If I were to flip-flop on this decision and  reinstate him,"
00:09:28.160,00:09:32.590,往后朕的旨意只怕无法令人信服,00:09:27.400,00:09:32.856,I'm afraid my words would carry less conviction in the future.
00:09:34.560,00:09:35.750,臣有失察之处,00:09:34.820,00:09:36.640,This is an error of my own making.
00:09:36.360,00:09:37.830,如果因臣的失察,,,
00:09:38.240,00:09:40.030,而使朝廷痛失良臣,00:09:36.640,00:09:42.620,"If it causes Your Majesty to lose a
reputable official, I cannot assuage my guilty conscience."
00:09:40.520,00:09:42.350,臣问心有愧,,,
00:09:43.520,00:09:45.190,既然皇上已有圣旨,,,
00:09:45.520,00:09:48.070,革了赵之垣直隶巡抚之职,00:09:43.780,00:09:48.520,"Your Majesty has already discharged him as a governor,"
00:09:49.320,00:09:51.950,那就派作他职吧,00:09:49.580,00:09:52.800,But what if he was appointed to another position?
00:09:52.640,00:09:54.830,一来可以顾全皇上的颜面,00:09:52.900,00:09:55.100,"For one thing, it saves face for Your Majesty."
00:09:55.080,00:09:57.590,二来也能顾及忠贞之臣,00:09:55.266,00:09:57.856,"For another, it saves a loyal servant to Your Majesty."
00:09:59.560,00:10:03.550,你真的坚持如此吗,00:09:59.820,00:10:03.820,Do you... insist?
00:10:05.600,00:10:07.350,臣已一错不可再错,00:10:05.980,00:10:08.060,"I have made a mistake.
I must not make another one."
00:10:07.880,00:10:10.910,请皇上容臣有错则改,00:10:08.140,00:10:11.360,I beg Your Majesty to allow me to make amends.
00:10:14.440,00:10:16.310,既然你如此力荐,,,
00:10:17.200,00:10:20.350,那朕就破格再录用他,00:10:14.700,00:10:20.760,"If you insist, I will make an exception and retain his services."
00:10:21.320,00:10:23.670,你说许他个什么官职呢,00:10:21.420,00:10:23.900,What position do you think I should give him?
00:10:23.880,00:10:26.830,臣惶恐皇上圣裁便是,00:10:23.900,00:10:27.000,I am too humble to make a decision for Your Majesty.
00:10:27.440,00:10:28.830,你知人善任,,,
00:10:29.880,00:10:31.950,必知道他最擅长什么,00:10:27.600,00:10:31.900,You know his strengths. I believe you will make a better judgement.
00:10:32.200,00:10:35.870,赵之垣可堪担当工部通政史一职,00:10:32.100,00:10:36.200,"Zhao Zhiyuan is qualified to be the
Review Director of the Ministry of Public Works."
,,,00:10:36.200,00:10:37.900,[in charge of official communication and public grievance]
00:10:37.680,00:10:39.110,朕听你的便是,00:10:38.120,00:10:40.300,I will take your advice.
00:10:40.600,00:10:41.470,谢皇上,00:10:40.980,00:10:43.040,I thank Your Majesty.
00:10:47.200,00:10:52.550,你一心为国 忠贞有加,00:10:46.900,00:10:52.800,"You have been more than loyal to the country, devoting your mind and your heart."
00:10:53.640,00:10:57.390,朕自然视你为股肱之臣,00:10:53.900,00:10:57.800,I see you as the backbone of the nation.
00:10:58.840,00:11:00.870,臣叩谢皇上,00:10:59.000,00:11:01.300,I bow to Your Majesty in humble gratitude.
00:11:08.440,00:11:10.590,不知是后宫哪位小主,00:11:08.700,00:11:10.900,"Please pardon my ignorance of your name, My Lady."
00:11:10.880,00:11:12.150,臣年羹尧见过,00:11:11.000,00:11:13.120,Nian Gengyao bows in respect to you.
00:11:13.400,00:11:14.870,我们小主是莞贵人,00:11:13.800,00:11:16.000,This is Noble Lady Sourire.
00:11:17.560,00:11:18.550,莞贵人,00:11:17.800,00:11:19.460,Noble Lady Sourire?
00:11:19.400,00:11:20.590,年大将军安好,00:11:19.600,00:11:21.320,Peace to Great General Nian.
00:11:21.280,00:11:22.510,谢贵人吉言,00:11:21.500,00:11:23.200,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:11:23.240,00:11:25.030,华妃娘娘是臣的妹妹,00:11:23.400,00:11:25.580,Consort Fleur is my sister.
00:11:25.680,00:11:28.670,娘娘安好 本将军才能安好,00:11:25.900,00:11:28.900,Peace to Her Highness is peace to myself.
00:11:29.760,00:11:31.270,娘娘深得皇上宠眷,00:11:29.600,00:11:33.000,Her Highness is in high favor and hence in peace.
00:11:31.880,00:11:32.910,怎会不安好,,,
00:11:34.120,00:11:36.310,皇上虽有疼爱之心,00:11:34.400,00:11:36.920,"Although she's in His Majesty's favor,"
00:11:37.000,00:11:39.030,怕只怕有些不知深浅,,,
00:11:39.320,00:11:43.430,不分尊卑之人恃宠生娇得罪娘娘,00:11:37.200,00:11:43.560,"I'm afraid she might be offended by someone conceited
about their status and impertinent to their superior."
00:11:44.840,00:11:47.790,想来无人敢无事生非吧,00:11:45.000,00:11:47.900,"I can't imagine anyone would ""make trouble out of nothing""."
00:11:48.160,00:11:49.350,但愿如此,00:11:48.500,00:11:50.080,I do hope so.
00:11:50.200,00:11:52.070,否则即便皇上不管,,,
00:11:52.360,00:11:54.790,本将军也不会袖手旁观,00:11:50.400,00:11:55.040,"Otherwise, I will step in for Her Highness
even if His Majesty doesn't."
00:11:55.800,00:11:58.150,兄妹情深向来如此,00:11:56.000,00:11:58.300,Brother and sister care for each other.
00:11:59.480,00:12:02.750,小主既然明白 臣先告退,00:11:59.600,00:12:03.100,"If you understand that, My Lady,
I shall take my leave."
00:12:07.360,00:12:09.830,年羹尧出去的时候神色如何,00:12:07.800,00:12:10.700,How did Nian Gengyao look when he went out?
00:12:12.000,00:12:15.150,大将军出去的时候比来时更高兴,00:12:12.200,00:12:15.500,"The great general looked even more
delighted than when he arrived."
00:12:16.240,00:12:19.070,皇上召见嘛 他能不得意吗,00:12:16.000,00:12:19.200,He looked very proud to be summoned by Your Majesty.
00:12:19.560,00:12:20.510,他是得意,00:12:19.700,00:12:21.240,So he did.
00:12:21.400,00:12:22.950,大将军刚才来的时候,,,
00:12:23.200,00:12:25.150,皇上正与十七爷下棋呢,00:12:21.760,00:12:25.360,"Your Majesty was playing Go with
Lord XVII when the great general arrived."
00:12:25.440,00:12:28.470,所以他就在外头坐等了一会儿,00:12:25.400,00:12:28.700,So the great general took a seat outside to wait.
00:12:28.800,00:12:30.190,他是坐等的,00:12:28.800,00:12:30.500,He was sitting?
00:12:30.720,00:12:31.430,是啊,00:12:30.600,00:12:32.240,"Ah, yes, he was."
00:12:31.760,00:12:33.750,就连十七爷出去的时候,00:12:32.300,00:12:35.660,"And, even when His Lordship went out,
the great general remained seated."
00:12:34.120,00:12:35.310,大将军都没起身呢,,,
00:12:35.680,00:12:36.870,说是足疾发作,00:12:35.740,00:12:37.980,He explained it was because of his injury.
00:12:37.760,00:12:39.510,幸好十七爷的性子,,,
00:12:39.800,00:12:41.030,是最和缓不过了,00:12:38.300,00:12:41.260,It was good that Lord XVII has a good temper.
00:12:41.320,00:12:42.190,也没跟他计较,00:12:41.360,00:12:43.120,His Lordship didn't take offence.
00:12:42.920,00:12:44.270,不过话说回来了,,,
00:12:44.800,00:12:46.390,大将军劳苦功高,00:12:43.280,00:12:48.580,"After all, who would take offence from the most honored general?"
00:12:46.760,00:12:48.550,又有谁敢跟他计较,,,
00:12:50.400,00:12:51.230,奴才失言,00:12:49.700,00:12:51.600,Perhaps I misspoke.
00:12:53.080,00:12:56.150,你是实话 未必是失言,00:12:53.400,00:12:56.500,You were being truthful.
00:13:05.600,00:13:06.190,苏公公,00:13:04.700,00:13:05.780,Aiyo.
00:13:06.400,00:13:07.150,莞贵人来了,00:13:06.200,00:13:07.980,"- Mr Su.
- Peace to Lady Sourire."
00:13:08.000,00:13:10.790,奴才正想着要用暖轿去接您呢,00:13:08.200,00:13:11.100,"I was going to send a sedan chair
for you to come over, My Lady."
00:13:11.040,00:13:11.670,不敢,00:13:11.100,00:13:12.380,I am flattered.
00:13:12.280,00:13:13.150,皇上在里头吗,,,
00:13:13.440,00:13:14.150,在,00:13:12.580,00:13:14.460,"- Is His Majesty here?
- Yes."
00:13:14.560,00:13:16.070,处大将军刚才来过,00:13:14.600,00:13:17.860,"Great General Nian visited.
He didn't get into His Majesty's good graces."
00:13:16.440,00:13:17.470,皇上不是很痛快,,,
00:13:17.960,00:13:19.630,小主可得小心应对呀,00:13:18.060,00:13:20.000,Your Lady should be mindful of this.
00:13:20.120,00:13:20.790,多谢公公,00:13:20.000,00:13:21.780,"Thank you, sir."
00:13:22.280,00:13:22.990,开门,00:13:22.780,00:13:24.480,Open the door.
00:13:34.520,00:13:35.910,臣妾给皇上请安,,,
00:13:36.200,00:13:37.430,皇上万福金安,00:13:34.600,00:13:37.940,"I bow before Your Majesty.
Peace and grace to Your Majesty."
00:13:37.920,00:13:38.670,快起来吧,00:13:38.200,00:13:39.360,Rise.
00:13:38.880,00:13:39.510,是,00:13:39.500,00:13:40.700,Yes.
00:13:40.520,00:13:41.270,坐,00:13:40.900,00:13:42.180,Sit.
00:13:42.280,00:13:44.070,臣妾是不是来的不是时候,00:13:42.740,00:13:45.040,Did I come at a bad time?
00:13:44.960,00:13:46.950,皇上刚与年大将军议完国事,00:13:45.200,00:13:49.140,"Your Majesty must be feeling a bit tired after
the meeting with Great General Nian."
00:13:47.520,00:13:48.710,定然觉得疲累了,,,
00:13:50.960,00:13:52.230,朕是有点乏,00:13:51.340,00:13:52.740,I do.
00:13:55.720,00:13:58.430,嬛嬛你饱读诗书,00:13:56.000,00:14:01.160,"Huan Huan, you are very well-read.
What do you think of political factions?"
00:13:59.360,00:14:00.790,对朋党如何看待,,,
00:14:01.520,00:14:02.870,臣妾不敢妄言政事,00:14:01.800,00:14:03.440,I should not pass comments on state affairs.
00:14:03.120,00:14:03.790,无妨,,,
00:14:04.640,00:14:06.830,朕只和你谈论史书,00:14:03.500,00:14:07.200,Don't worry. We will talk only about history.
00:14:08.000,00:14:10.590,臣妾久在深宫哪里知道这些,00:14:08.340,00:14:11.140,I know little about it as a concubine in the harem.
00:14:11.760,00:14:15.510,倒是臣妾读欧阳修的朋党论时,00:14:12.000,00:14:16.340,"But I deeply sympathize with
the Proposition on Factions by Ouyang Xiu."
00:14:16.040,00:14:17.310,有段话深觉有理,00:14:16.340,00:14:18.400,[an essayist from 11th century]
00:14:18.680,00:14:19.390,说来早早,00:14:18.700,00:14:20.580,I'd love to hear your thoughts.
00:14:20.920,00:14:21.910,欧阳公说,00:14:21.160,00:14:22.620,"Sir Ouyang Xiu wrote,"
00:14:22.320,00:14:23.430,小人同利之时,,,
00:14:23.720,00:14:25.030,暂相党引成为朋党,00:14:22.620,00:14:25.340,"""Inferior men become temporary allies only when their interests coincide."""
00:14:25.400,00:14:26.910,等到见利而争先,,,
00:14:27.280,00:14:30.190,或利尽而交疏时 则互相贼害,00:14:25.400,00:14:30.740,"“But are at each other's throats if they vie for first place,
or if they drift apart when the benefits of alliance dwindle.”"
00:14:30.560,00:14:34.150,以利相聚必然会为争利而散,00:14:30.940,00:14:34.780,An alliance based solely on benefits can easily collapse over benefits.
00:14:34.800,00:14:36.030,所以任何烦心事,,,
00:14:36.480,00:14:38.270,都不足以成为皇上的烦心事,00:14:34.960,00:14:39.040,"That being said, no faction should be a concern for Your Majesty."
00:14:41.920,00:14:44.430,你惯会口头上哄朕高兴,00:14:42.240,00:14:45.580,You always coax me into feeling better.
00:14:45.600,00:14:46.430,说说不算,00:14:45.980,00:14:47.440,Reciting Ouyang's essay doesn't count.
00:14:47.400,00:14:50.070,你得将欧阳修的朋党论写下来,,,
00:14:51.080,00:14:52.750,待朕烦心的时候,00:14:47.440,00:14:54.180,"You must transcribe the complete essay
so I can see your handwriting when I'm upset."
00:14:53.120,00:14:54.150,看你的字便是了,,,
00:14:55.120,00:14:55.990,闹了半天,,,
00:14:56.440,00:14:58.390,皇上只为哄臣妾写字呢,00:14:55.340,00:14:59.300,"This whole conversation Your Majesty just
wanted to coax me into copying down an essay."
00:14:59.640,00:15:01.390,臣妾的字最像鬼画符了,00:14:59.460,00:15:02.440,"My handwriting is no better than the script
on a Taoist Fulu to dispel evil spirits."
00:15:02.160,00:15:03.150,皇上若想看,,,
00:15:03.840,00:15:06.070,随便找一位名家写上一篇就是了,00:15:02.540,00:15:07.580,Your Majesty should ask a famous calligrapher to write it.
00:15:14.040,00:15:14.790,皇上,00:15:14.380,00:15:16.640,Your Majesty ...
00:15:19.840,00:15:22.390,男人的字再好也是粗豪气,00:15:19.840,00:15:23.180,The male calligraphers have good writing but bold and rough-hewn.
00:15:23.320,00:15:25.590,不若闺阁小字细细写来,,,
00:15:26.400,00:15:30.910,若烦心时便能有凝神静气之效,00:15:23.320,00:15:31.360,"Unlike a lady's attentive and dainty writing
which can help me calm down and concentrate."
00:15:32.800,00:15:35.510,那臣妾就恭敬不如从命了,00:15:32.800,00:15:35.880,I'm honored to obey if Your Majesty says so.
00:15:36.160,00:15:36.790,写吧,00:15:36.160,00:15:37.440,Please.
00:15:43.840,00:15:44.510,娘娘,00:15:43.840,00:15:45.860,Your Highness.
00:15:49.000,00:15:51.790,娘娘除了约定的十万两银票,00:15:49.000,00:15:52.080,"Your Highness, in addition to the 100,000 taels Zhao Zhiyuan promised,"
00:15:52.160,00:15:54.950,这些都是赵大人额外孝敬您的,00:15:52.160,00:15:55.040,He offered Your Highness some extra gifts.
00:15:55.640,00:15:57.230,他居然说动了哥哥,00:15:55.640,00:15:57.640,I didn't expect him to persuade my brother.
00:15:57.680,00:15:58.630,可不是嘛娘娘,,,
00:15:59.400,00:16:02.350,这赵大人如今是跟定了年大将军,00:15:57.680,00:16:02.340,Mr Zhao showed absolute loyalty to Great General Nian.
00:16:02.720,00:16:04.750,大将军还亲自向皇上开口,00:16:02.720,00:16:07.160,It was unexpected that the Great General would personally ask His Majesty to re-appoint Zhao.
00:16:05.120,00:16:06.430,为赵大人请了官,,,
00:16:07.560,00:16:09.390,他果真就说了一句话,00:16:07.860,00:16:09.980,And Zhao only said one sentence to my brother?
00:16:10.000,00:16:11.390,回娘娘 是的,00:16:10.000,00:16:12.380,"Exactly, Your Highness."
00:16:13.040,00:16:14.550,本宫就好奇了,00:16:13.040,00:16:15.020,Now I'm intrigued.
00:16:15.480,00:16:17.030,这是怎样的一句话,00:16:15.480,00:16:17.600,What could this sentence be?
00:16:17.640,00:16:18.550,奴才听说,,,
00:16:19.000,00:16:20.910,这赵大人见了年大将军,00:16:17.920,00:16:20.960,"I heard that when Mr Zhao visited the Great General,"
00:16:21.160,00:16:22.230,只说了那么一句,,,
00:16:22.560,00:16:23.710,三十万两雪花银,00:16:21.160,00:16:25.540,"he simply said 300,000 taels would be sent to the Great General"
00:16:24.120,00:16:25.470,送进处大将军府中,,,
00:16:25.840,00:16:29.070,十万两银票送进翊坤宫,00:16:25.840,00:16:29.580,"and 100,000 to the Palace of Earthly Honor."
00:16:31.400,00:16:32.950,算他能干,00:16:31.780,00:16:33.820,"So, he's competent."
00:16:45.800,00:16:48.030,小主为这个寝衣费尽了心思,00:16:45.800,00:16:48.640,"My Lady, you put all your heart into this robe."
00:16:48.520,00:16:50.990,这衣服当真是无可挑剔的,00:16:48.640,00:16:51.800,It is impeccable work.
00:16:52.520,00:16:54.150,若是换上陵容的刺绣,,,
00:16:54.920,00:16:56.630,定是比我好上十倍,00:16:52.920,00:16:57.420,Lingrong's needlework is ten times better than mine.
00:16:57.920,00:16:58.830,若论绣工,,,
00:16:59.080,00:17:01.110,肯定是人外有人天外有天,00:16:58.320,00:17:01.460,There is always someone who has better skills.
00:17:01.640,00:17:03.430,可是若论心意,,,
00:17:03.880,00:17:05.670,这件就是最好的,00:17:01.880,00:17:06.140,But no one could put more thought into it than you.
00:17:06.360,00:17:07.630,皇上待我这样好,,,
00:17:08.320,00:17:10.030,我自然要全心全意待他,00:17:06.640,00:17:11.380,"His Majesty is so good to me.
I must commit all my heart to him."
00:17:16.320,00:17:19.150,这画龙点睛只差最后几针了,00:17:16.320,00:17:19.160,The finishing touches to a dragon are the eyes.
00:17:19.720,00:17:20.990,龙眼睛就绣完了,00:17:19.720,00:17:20.990,You are just a few stitches from completion.
00:17:25.560,00:17:27.790,可不是嘛 绣了好几日呢,00:17:25.560,00:17:28.260,"Well, it took me a good couple of days."
00:17:28.720,00:17:30.030,小主绣工真好,00:17:28.720,00:17:30.520,"My Lady, you are so skilled at embroidery."
00:17:30.440,00:17:31.790,绣院里最好的绣娘,00:17:30.520,00:17:33.360,Even the professional weavers do not compare to you.
00:17:32.080,00:17:33.070,都比不过小主呢,,,
00:17:33.560,00:17:35.030,而且小主好心思,00:17:33.560,00:17:35.380,"And it's a very thoughtful gift, My Lady."
00:17:35.360,00:17:37.510,寝衣嘛 是最贴身的,00:17:35.540,00:17:38.080,A sleeping robe is worn next to the skin.
00:17:38.040,00:17:40.150,若皇上真的穿上了这件寝衣,,,
00:17:40.600,00:17:42.550,那定能体会到小主的情意,00:17:38.320,00:17:43.480,His Majesty will be able feel your affection if he wears it.
00:17:48.320,00:17:50.310,皇上 皇后娘娘驾到,00:17:48.600,00:17:51.620,"Your Majesty, Her Majesty the Empress is here."
00:17:52.240,00:17:53.590,臣妾给皇上请安,00:17:52.240,00:17:53.960,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:17:53.840,00:17:55.110,来啦 平身吧,00:17:54.120,00:17:55.260,Rise.
00:17:55.520,00:17:56.430,谢皇上,00:17:55.520,00:17:57.060,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:03.560,00:18:05.470,这个月后宫的账单银子,00:18:03.800,00:18:06.720,The bills of the harem this month have been cleared.
00:18:05.840,00:18:06.710,都已经清了,,,
00:18:07.000,00:18:09.030,臣妾特拿来与皇上过目,00:18:07.000,00:18:09.920,I brought the account book for Your Majesty's review.
00:18:17.120,00:18:19.670,怎么翊坤宫这个月开支八千两,00:18:17.120,00:18:19.840,"How come the Palace of Earthly Honor spent 8,000 taels this month?"
00:18:20.440,00:18:22.710,比皇后宫中多出三倍不止,00:18:20.620,00:18:23.060,That is three times more than your palace.
00:18:23.960,00:18:26.110,再过一个月便是年下了,00:18:24.000,00:18:26.460,It is the New Year in one month.
00:18:26.480,00:18:27.990,华妃一向喜欢奢华,,,
00:18:28.280,00:18:29.710,难免开销大些,00:18:26.720,00:18:30.040,Consort Fleur is fond of an extravagant lifestyle. Her expenditures are not surprising.
00:18:30.160,00:18:30.990,即便如此,,,
00:18:31.760,00:18:33.430,你是皇后 她是妃子,00:18:30.300,00:18:34.400,"Even so, you are the Empress and she is a consort."
00:18:34.400,00:18:35.310,她的用度,,,
00:18:35.560,00:18:37.990,也断不能超过皇后宫中啊,00:18:34.800,00:18:38.220,Her spending cannot exceed yours.
00:18:38.960,00:18:40.390,华妃注重颜面,,,
00:18:41.000,00:18:43.110,所用装饰多贴金箔,00:18:39.240,00:18:43.620,Consort Fleur wrapped her decorations with gold foil to gain face.
00:18:43.680,00:18:44.790,她又命内务府,,,
00:18:45.000,00:18:46.710,新制了一批首饰衣衫,00:18:44.020,00:18:47.320,"She ordered new clothing and jewelry
from the Household Department."
00:18:47.400,00:18:48.870,加之年将军入京,,,
00:18:49.360,00:18:51.190,华妃少不得赏赐些,00:18:47.620,00:18:51.740,"Besides, General Nian returned to Beijing,
so she had to spend more to reward his servants."
00:18:51.520,00:18:53.310,所以支出得多了些,00:18:51.860,00:18:54.080,That was why she had additional expenses.
00:18:53.920,00:18:55.270,女为悦己者容,00:18:54.080,00:18:56.220,“A woman adorns herself for those who delight her.”
00:18:55.800,00:18:57.990,何况华妃也是周全年家,,,
00:18:58.280,00:18:59.590,和皇家的颜面,00:18:56.220,00:19:00.380,Consort Fleur is also maintaining prestige for the Nians and the Imperial Family.
00:19:01.000,00:19:02.230,她若是为了娘家,,,
00:19:03.240,00:19:04.470,那便算不得什么,00:19:00.840,00:19:05.280,It's not a big deal if she is doing so for the Nians.
00:19:06.360,00:19:08.110,以后她宫里使多少银子,00:19:06.540,00:19:09.760,Let me know how much she spends in the future.
00:19:08.440,00:19:09.190,你跟朕说一声,,,
00:19:09.560,00:19:10.230,是,00:19:09.820,00:19:11.120,Yes.
00:19:11.880,00:19:13.030,不过这些银子,,,
00:19:13.360,00:19:15.110,只是翊坤宫的日常开销,00:19:12.180,00:19:15.780,"However, these are just the expenses of her palace."
00:19:15.680,00:19:17.670,臣妾粗粗问了下,,,
00:19:18.240,00:19:21.830,华妃赏人的银子就不止这个数,00:19:15.920,00:19:22.220,I have an inkling that she spent even more on the rewards.
00:19:22.960,00:19:27.270,想必年羹尧给华妃也贴补了不少,00:19:23.380,00:19:27.500,I believe Nian Gengyao supported Consort Fleur a lot.
00:19:28.240,00:19:30.470,羊毛出在羊身上由她吧,00:19:28.540,00:19:31.860,"She gets the benefits from the price her family paid.
Let her be."
00:19:32.680,00:19:34.030,臣妾敢问一句,00:19:32.960,00:19:35.740,"Excuse my bluntness, Your Majesty,"
00:19:35.640,00:19:38.390,这些银子若是出在年羹尧府中,,,
00:19:39.280,00:19:42.310,皇上可曾赏过年羹尧那么多呀,00:19:36.020,00:19:42.480,"if the money came from Nian Gengyao,
did you reward him that much?"
00:19:43.280,00:19:44.910,若不是皇上赏的,,,
00:19:45.320,00:19:48.030,华妃一个月就所用这么多,00:19:43.600,00:19:50.600,"If not, where could the money come from
to cover her enormous expense in a month?"
00:19:48.360,00:19:50.550,那这些银子又会从哪里来呢,,,
00:19:50.960,00:19:54.270,这些朕多少知道 不必说了,00:19:51.120,00:19:55.260,I'm aware of the discrepency. Let's not pursue it.
00:19:55.200,00:19:55.910,是,00:19:55.360,00:19:56.740,Yes.
00:19:57.560,00:19:59.630,皇上 碎玉玉和延禧宫,00:19:57.720,00:20:01.500,"Your Majesty, sleep robes have arrived from both the Palace of Pearl Jade and the Palace of Prolonging Happiness."
00:19:59.960,00:20:02.230,各送来寝衣一套 请皇上过目,00:20:01.500,00:20:02.640,Please have a look.
00:20:02.480,00:20:05.110,碎玉玉和延禧宫真是心有灵犀,00:20:02.680,00:20:07.000,"The two sisters are mentally synchronized.
Your Majesty should take a look right away."
00:20:05.800,00:20:06.950,皇上不妨一观,,,
00:20:07.160,00:20:07.910,拿来吧,00:20:07.200,00:20:08.580,Bring them forward.
00:20:17.800,00:20:19.750,这金龙绣得栩栩如生,00:20:18.180,00:20:20.600,The golden dragon is embroidered so vividly.
00:20:20.160,00:20:22.470,一看便知是安常在的手艺,00:20:20.600,00:20:23.240,This is apparently from Attendant An.
00:20:23.200,00:20:25.110,后宫里头再没有人的绣工,,,
00:20:25.440,00:20:26.350,比得上她了,00:20:23.620,00:20:27.400,No one in the palace exceeds her at embroidery.
00:20:28.760,00:20:29.510,的确不借,00:20:28.920,00:20:30.920,It's good.
00:20:32.200,00:20:33.390,虽然是寝衣,,,
00:20:33.640,00:20:36.110,但能在细微处也做得如此精心,00:20:32.660,00:20:36.720,She is meticulous about the details even on a sleep robe.
00:20:36.480,00:20:39.310,看来安常在的心中的确有皇上,00:20:36.740,00:20:40.480,Attendant An seems to always have Your Majesty in her heart.
00:20:47.840,00:20:49.190,淳儿这么大个人了,,,
00:20:49.520,00:20:50.710,还要玩这些香粉,00:20:48.340,00:20:53.240,"Chun'er is still like a kid. She is very fond of
body powders and wants to show us her collection."
00:20:51.000,00:20:52.390,巴巴催着咱们给她看,,,
00:20:53.320,00:20:54.070,能不看吗,00:20:53.360,00:20:54.620,Why not ?
00:20:54.320,00:20:55.670,嬷嬷老说我身上不够白,,,
00:20:56.120,00:20:57.910,每天都给我抹这么多的香粉,00:20:54.620,00:20:58.580,My instructor always says I need to make my skin brighter and puts so much powder on me.
00:20:58.560,00:20:59.550,现在得了好的,,,
00:20:59.920,00:21:01.150,我自然要来给姐姐看哪,00:20:58.800,00:21:02.680,"Now that I have some good powders, I have to show them to you, Sourire."
00:21:04.000,00:21:05.430,这是扬州的茉莉粉,00:21:04.060,00:21:06.060,This is the Jasmine Powder from Yangzhou.
00:21:05.960,00:21:08.070,说是用白茉莉花磨碎了兑进去的,00:21:06.060,00:21:08.600,It’s said to be made of ground white jasmine flowers.
00:21:08.440,00:21:10.750,这粉又细又香比雪还白呢,00:21:08.660,00:21:11.860,"The powder is fine and fragrant,
and even whiter than snow."
00:21:12.000,00:21:13.390,果真是上好的香粉,00:21:12.260,00:21:14.560,This is indeed superior powder.
00:21:14.480,00:21:16.190,我那里倒有一盒葵花粉,00:21:14.680,00:21:16.680,I have a box of Sunflower Powder.
00:21:16.520,00:21:18.270,白是白 就是没这个香,00:21:16.940,00:21:19.260,"It's white, but not as fragrant as the Jasmine Powder."
00:21:19.480,00:21:20.870,原以为每天涂脂抹粉,00:21:19.460,00:21:22.420,I thought it was already a lot of trouble to powder my face.
00:21:21.160,00:21:21.910,就够麻烦的了,,,
00:21:22.560,00:21:24.470,现在天天要往身上抹这个东西,,,
00:21:24.880,00:21:26.150,而且哪处都不能放过,00:21:22.560,00:21:26.880,Now I have to powder every part of my body.
00:21:27.440,00:21:30.030,粉抹得多才能养得皮肤白嫩细致,00:21:27.380,00:21:30.360,Putting on more powder will make your skin finer.
00:21:30.400,00:21:31.750,这不是一朝一夕的工夫,00:21:30.380,00:21:32.380,But it won't make a difference overnight.
00:21:32.120,00:21:33.390,得要天天抹夜夜抹,,,
00:21:33.760,00:21:34.510,才能养得肤色,00:21:32.380,00:21:36.460,You will have to powder yourself every day and every night to make your skin like a peeled egg.
00:21:34.760,00:21:36.150,像剥了壳的鸡蛋似的,,,
00:21:36.840,00:21:39.670,来 我给你扑上 保准又白又香,00:21:36.960,00:21:40.060,"Come here, I'll powder you into a fragrant egg."
00:21:40.080,00:21:41.310,皇上喜欢得不得了,00:21:40.160,00:21:42.320,An egg His Majesty will absolutely like.
00:21:43.320,00:21:44.230,我告诉你们啊,,,
00:21:44.640,00:21:45.950,昨夜我去侍寝,00:21:43.220,00:21:46.820,"Speaking of His Majesty, when I served him last night,"
00:21:46.560,00:21:47.590,我就起了好奇,,,
00:21:48.040,00:21:50.110,这皇上身上白不白呢,00:21:47.160,00:21:51.020,I was curious to know if his body is fair.
00:21:51.400,00:21:52.510,我很想看来着,00:21:51.200,00:21:53.480,I really wanted to find out.
00:21:52.920,00:21:53.590,你们要知道啊,,,
00:21:53.920,00:21:56.110,我以前可都是闭了眼不敢看的,00:21:53.480,00:21:56.760,"You know, I never dared to open my eyes."
00:21:56.400,00:21:57.950,这丫头净胡说,00:21:56.760,00:21:58.900,"Stop it, stop your nonsense."
00:21:58.520,00:21:59.870,姐姐你别拦她,00:21:59.240,00:22:00.740,"Sourire, don't stop her."
00:22:00.320,00:22:02.030,你让她说让她说,00:22:00.740,00:22:02.280,Let her tell us.
00:22:02.440,00:22:03.710,她不懂事你还由着她,00:22:02.280,00:22:04.580,She is being coarse. Don't indulge her.
00:22:04.520,00:22:05.910,我使劲看使劲看,00:22:04.940,00:22:06.760,I tried so hard to look...
00:22:06.360,00:22:07.670,结果皇上就看着我说,00:22:06.800,00:22:08.460,"And His Majesty looked at me and said,"
00:22:08.080,00:22:10.230,你今天怎么老盯着朕看哪,00:22:08.460,00:22:10.460,why are you staring at me today?
00:22:10.600,00:22:11.550,是不是喜欢朕身上,,,
00:22:12.040,00:22:13.190,金龙出云的花样,00:22:10.460,00:22:13.560,"Do you like the pattern ""golden dragon
emerging from clouds"" on my robe?"
00:22:13.880,00:22:14.630,你要是喜欢,,,
00:22:15.040,00:22:16.670,朕就让人铰下来给你吧,00:22:14.580,00:22:17.460,I will have it cut out for you if you like.
00:22:17.720,00:22:18.510,然后呢,00:22:17.940,00:22:19.080,And then?
00:22:18.880,00:22:20.510,然后皇上就真脱下来了,,,
00:22:20.880,00:22:23.150,穿上了一件二龙抢珠的寝衣,00:22:19.080,00:22:23.360,"Then His Majesty took off the robe and put on another with ""two dragons fighting over a flaming pearl""."
00:22:23.840,00:22:24.790,皇上就跟我说,,,
00:22:25.360,00:22:27.590,你别再盯着朕了早点睡吧,00:22:24.200,00:22:28.480,"His Majesty said to me,
""Don't stare at me anymore. Go to sleep."""
00:22:33.040,00:22:35.550,然后皇上就真换了寝衣,00:22:33.220,00:22:35.980,So His Majesty put on another robe?
00:22:36.160,00:22:37.950,是啊 这有什么可骗人的,00:22:36.160,00:22:38.280,"Yes, why would I make that up?"
00:22:38.240,00:22:38.990,皇上还说了,,,
00:22:39.400,00:22:41.350,他特别喜欢二龙抢珠上的料子,00:22:38.400,00:22:42.080,"His Majesty added that he really likes the material of the robe with ""two dragons fighting over a flaming pearl""."
00:22:41.880,00:22:44.430,说就得这样才贴心和舒服呢,00:22:42.200,00:22:45.100,He said it calms him to the heart.
00:22:45.160,00:22:45.950,我就问了,,,
00:22:46.280,00:22:48.070,那这件衣裳是谁送给你的呢,00:22:45.280,00:22:48.360,"So I asked, ""Who made you this robe?"""
00:22:48.720,00:22:49.590,皇上笑着说,,,
00:22:50.080,00:22:51.790,那你去问你的莞姐姐吧,00:22:48.840,00:22:52.880,"His Majesty smiled, ""Go ask your dear sister Sourire."""
00:22:56.200,00:22:57.670,原来是莞姐姐绣的,00:22:55.240,00:22:58.320,"Oh, I didn't know it was made by Sourire."
00:22:58.400,00:22:59.910,别胡说 谁信你的,00:22:58.420,00:23:00.480,Don't listen to her. I don't believe that!
00:23:00.360,00:23:01.590,我才没有胡说呢,00:23:00.480,00:23:02.180,Those were his exact words!
00:23:01.960,00:23:03.950,我就问皇上是不是莞姐姐做的,,,
00:23:04.320,00:23:05.150,皇上您特别喜欢,00:23:02.280,00:23:06.160,"I asked him, “Do you like this robe in particular because it was made by Sourire?"""
00:23:06.040,00:23:06.910,皇上就说了,,,
00:23:07.920,00:23:10.350,什么人做什么衣服 朕心里有数,00:23:06.280,00:23:10.780,"He said, “Hmm, clothes made by different people feel different.”"
00:23:11.360,00:23:12.070,我就笑了,,,
00:23:12.400,00:23:13.110,我问皇上,,,
00:23:13.480,00:23:14.990,那是不是那件金龙出云,00:23:11.160,00:23:17.180,"And I laughed, ""Do you not like the robe with one dragon because the pattern is conservative?"""
00:23:15.280,00:23:17.230,太小家子气了皇上不喜欢,,,
00:23:17.760,00:23:19.150,定是绣院的绣娘们做的,00:23:17.320,00:23:19.560,"""It must be made by the Embroidery Department."""
00:23:19.680,00:23:20.390,别胡说,00:23:19.860,00:23:21.140,Stop this nonsense.
00:23:20.760,00:23:21.510,皇上喜欢你,,,
00:23:21.920,00:23:23.350,也不能老这样口无遮拦的,00:23:21.260,00:23:24.240,"You must speak with propriety
 no matter how much His Majesty likes you."
00:23:24.640,00:23:25.390,我只是觉得,,,
00:23:25.880,00:23:27.950,一条龙弧弧单单地盘在云里,00:23:24.340,00:23:29.220,"Hmm, I just felt that the one dragon was lonely in the clouds."
00:23:28.280,00:23:29.270,有什么好呀,,,
00:23:29.560,00:23:30.870,干吗不找个伴儿呢,00:23:29.500,00:23:31.880,Why doesn't he have a companion?
00:23:32.160,00:23:34.630,好了好了不说这个了也不害臊,00:23:32.420,00:23:34.340,That's enough. We are not talking about this now.
,,,00:23:34.340,00:23:36.200,Don't tell everyone what His Majesty said to you.
00:23:36.240,00:23:38.070,我让小厨房蒸了梅花糕,00:23:36.500,00:23:39.000,My kitchen made plum blossom cakes.
00:23:39.320,00:23:40.830,你快去瞧瞧好了没有,00:23:39.520,00:23:41.300,Go check if they are ready.
00:23:41.200,00:23:42.990,若是好了 端来给你安姐姐尝尝,00:23:41.300,00:23:43.460,Get some for Lingrong if they are.
00:23:43.280,00:23:43.710,好,,,
00:23:43.920,00:23:44.630,槿汐你陪她去,00:23:43.460,00:23:44.520,That's great!
,,,00:23:44.520,00:23:45.640,"Jinxi, go with her."
00:23:45.320,00:23:45.990,走,00:23:45.640,00:23:46.740,Let’s go.
00:23:48.320,00:23:49.670,太医今日来瞧过,00:23:48.080,00:23:50.280,The imperial doctor dropped by today.
00:23:50.200,00:23:53.150,说我肠胃不太好不宜吃糕点的,00:23:50.520,00:23:53.900,He said glutinous cakes can cause me indigestion.
00:23:54.800,00:23:56.550,我看吃药的时辰也快到了,00:23:54.600,00:23:58.080,"It’s almost time for my medicine.
I should go now."
00:23:56.840,00:23:57.830,我就先回去了,,,
00:23:58.520,00:24:00.430,那好回去头上小心,00:23:58.540,00:24:00.980,"Certainly. Take care, Lingrong."
,,,00:24:06.020,00:24:14.820,"[contact translators] carsenwei@yahoo.com
[subtitles subscription] liberapay.com/ZHZSubbers"
00:24:28.320,00:24:29.510,小主这是怎么了,00:24:28.260,00:24:29.920,"What’s wrong, My Lady?"
00:24:29.760,00:24:31.590,怎么好端端地就哭起来了呢,00:24:29.920,00:24:31.840,Why are you crying?
00:24:35.640,00:24:36.310,出去,00:24:35.800,00:24:37.720,Get out.
00:24:39.000,00:24:41.190,小主思念家人伤心难耐,00:24:39.340,00:24:41.940,My Lady misses her family. Don't take it personal.
00:24:41.960,00:24:44.750,你也别往心里去出去伺候,00:24:42.420,00:24:45.020,You can go work outside.
00:24:45.480,00:24:46.070,是,00:24:45.820,00:24:47.200,Yes.
00:24:57.000,00:24:57.950,淳儿回去了吧,00:24:56.900,00:24:58.460,Did Chun’er leave?
00:24:58.800,00:25:00.230,包了两包细点回去了,00:24:58.460,00:25:01.460,"Yes, she hopped back with two packs of cakes joyfully."
00:25:00.560,00:25:01.390,欢天喜地的,,,
00:25:02.280,00:25:04.870,淳儿心思单纯总是欢欢喜喜的,00:25:02.620,00:25:05.320,She’s a child at heart and always cheerful.
00:25:05.400,00:25:06.790,小主的这几个姐妹里,00:25:05.660,00:25:07.200,"Of your friends, My Lady,"
00:25:07.200,00:25:08.990,沈答应呢 温厚大方,00:25:07.220,00:25:09.460,Companion Shen is gentle and decorous;
00:25:09.360,00:25:11.150,淳小主呢 天真无邪,00:25:09.580,00:25:11.940,Attendant Chun is innocent and pure;
00:25:12.000,00:25:14.030,安小主心思细腻,00:25:12.160,00:25:14.760,Attendant An has a delicate heart.
00:25:14.920,00:25:16.230,就因为她心思细腻,,,
00:25:16.800,00:25:17.670,所以有时候,00:25:15.100,00:25:20.280,"Because of that, I’m always cautious about what I say to her."
00:25:18.000,00:25:19.830,我也不敢轻易在她面前说些什么,,,
00:25:20.560,00:25:23.070,就像今日淳儿有口无心,00:25:20.760,00:25:23.540,Chun’er had no ill intention over the robe.
00:25:23.600,00:25:25.430,只怕陵容早去又要多心了,00:25:23.560,00:25:26.060,But I’m afraid Lingrong is sensitive about it.
00:25:26.640,00:25:27.870,这几个小主里面,,,
00:25:28.320,00:25:31.750,也就淳常在最无心机天真难得,00:25:27.180,00:25:32.220,"Attendant Chun is unsophisticated and free-spoken.
That is a precious personality in the harem."
00:25:32.880,00:25:35.310,就因为她太天真我反而担心,00:25:33.140,00:25:36.100,But it worries me that she might be too free-spoken.
00:25:35.920,00:25:37.470,有时候她得罪人都不知道,00:25:36.120,00:25:39.200,She doesn't even realize when she offends someone.
00:25:39.200,00:25:42.470,那就只能让小主多费心,00:25:39.740,00:25:45.000,"My Lady, you have to help them mend their fences."
00:25:42.840,00:25:44.990,为淳小主周全周全,,,
00:25:45.840,00:25:46.990,这对和田玉钗,,,
00:25:47.440,00:25:50.230,玉质温厚细腻是难得的珍品,00:25:46.000,00:25:50.800,"The Hetian jade on the paired hairpins feels
warm and gentle. It is of rare quality."
00:25:50.920,00:25:52.870,一会儿你送去延禧宫给陵容吧,00:25:51.160,00:25:53.360,Send them to the Palace of Prolonging Happiness for Lingrong.
00:25:53.040,00:25:53.790,这,,,
00:25:54.080,00:25:55.550,奴婢记得这对玉钗,,,
00:25:56.240,00:25:58.390,可是皇上私下赏给小主的,00:25:54.100,00:25:59.000,"Um ... I remember this pair of jade hairpins
was a private gift from His Majesty."
00:26:01.760,00:26:03.510,小主为了安抚安常在,,,
00:26:03.800,00:26:05.310,真的是费尽心思啊,00:26:01.640,00:26:06.040,"My Lady, you are making a great effort
to comfort Attendant An."
00:26:06.720,00:26:08.350,宫中真心的姐妹太少了,00:26:06.460,00:26:08.920,Real friends in the palace are rarer than jade.
00:26:08.880,00:26:09.710,别叫她难受,00:26:08.920,00:26:10.800,I don’t wish her to be unhappy.
00:26:12.080,00:26:14.150,那奴婢就把这对玉钗,,,
00:26:14.680,00:26:16.150,好好地送给安常在,00:26:12.380,00:26:16.720,I will send them to Attendant An with great care.
00:26:17.440,00:26:18.710,小主的一番苦心,,,
00:26:19.040,00:26:20.550,想必安常在她必能明白,00:26:17.800,00:26:21.560,"She will understand your sincere intention, My Lady."
00:26:22.280,00:26:24.150,那奴婢就去了,00:26:22.500,00:26:24.720,I will take my leave.
00:26:24.560,00:26:25.310,去吧,00:26:24.720,00:26:26.320,Certainly.
00:26:37.960,00:26:38.870,小主吉祥,00:26:38.440,00:26:40.160,Peace to My Lady.
00:26:39.840,00:26:41.950,姑姑这个时候你怎么来了,00:26:40.400,00:26:42.780,"Madam, what brings you here?"
00:26:43.000,00:26:44.510,莞贵人新得了一对玉钗,00:26:43.380,00:26:46.000,Lady Sourire recently received a pair of jade hairpins.
00:26:45.720,00:26:47.070,念及在宫中姐妹里,,,
00:26:47.480,00:26:48.870,与小主是最要好的,,,
00:26:49.240,00:26:51.030,所以特地让我来赠与小主,00:26:46.660,00:26:51.440,"She sees you as her closest sister in the palace,
so she asked me to send the hairpins to you."
00:26:51.560,00:26:52.390,多谢姐姐,00:26:51.840,00:26:53.640,I am deeply grateful.
00:26:52.920,00:26:55.070,她有什么好的东西都想着我,00:26:53.640,00:26:55.920,"She always remembers me
when she receives a precious gift."
00:26:55.680,00:26:56.590,我们小主说了,,,
00:26:57.000,00:26:59.390,当年在府中有什么好看的首饰,00:26:55.980,00:27:01.220,Lady Sourire told me that you two would always share jewelry when you were living with her.
00:26:59.720,00:27:00.870,都是两个人轮着戴的,,,
00:27:01.240,00:27:03.510,如今到了宫中更要有福同享了,00:27:01.500,00:27:04.120,"Now, in the palace, she wishes always to
share her joy and happiness with you."
00:27:04.280,00:27:06.190,宝鹃替我好生收着,00:27:04.640,00:27:06.640,"Coua, put it away carefully."
00:27:06.480,00:27:07.030,是,,,
00:27:07.280,00:27:08.230,我可欢喜得很,00:27:06.800,00:27:07.860,Yes.
,,,00:27:07.860,00:27:09.580,I am overjoyed to receive this.
00:27:09.640,00:27:11.350,替我回去多谢姐姐,00:27:09.760,00:27:12.140,Please thank her profusely on my behalf.
00:27:12.160,00:27:15.110,对了今日我听姐姐咳了一声,00:27:12.180,00:27:15.680,I heard Sourire coughing slightly today.
00:27:15.720,00:27:16.870,劳烦姑姑回去,,,
00:27:17.240,00:27:19.270,替姐姐熬一剂冰糖枇杷叶,00:27:16.120,00:27:19.920,"Madam, may I trouble you to make
loquat leaf tea with rock sugar for her?"
00:27:20.720,00:27:21.990,多谢小主关怀了,00:27:20.240,00:27:22.640,"Thanks for your concern, My Lady."
00:27:22.480,00:27:23.830,奴婢一定回去照办,00:27:22.740,00:27:24.600,I will follow your order.
00:27:25.640,00:27:28.270,奴婢来还有一句话要转告小主,00:27:25.580,00:27:28.780,"I have some words to pass on to you, My Lady."
00:27:29.320,00:27:30.990,淳常在处幼天真,00:27:29.560,00:27:31.560,Attendant Chun is young and free-spoken.
00:27:31.360,00:27:32.990,若有什么话说得不妥当了,,,
00:27:33.640,00:27:36.110,还请安小主多担待,00:27:31.560,00:27:36.280,Please be forgiving of her if she said anything improper.
00:27:37.960,00:27:40.310,这个自然都是自家姐妹,00:27:37.800,00:27:41.160,We are sisters in the imperial family.
00:27:40.760,00:27:42.190,有什么计较不计较的,00:27:41.200,00:27:43.200,I don't mind Chun'er.
00:27:43.000,00:27:45.390,更何况淳儿那性子,00:27:43.380,00:27:47.120,I know the person she is.
00:27:45.920,00:27:46.830,我又不是不知道,,,
00:27:48.240,00:27:51.190,小主宽厚真是淳常在的福气呢,00:27:48.660,00:27:51.800,"My Lady, your tolerance and understanding
means a lot to Attendant Chun."
00:27:51.880,00:27:53.950,那奴婢就告退了,00:27:52.060,00:27:54.060,I shall take my leave.
00:27:54.520,00:27:55.390,姑姑慢走,00:27:54.260,00:27:56.260,Take care.
00:27:56.000,00:27:57.590,宝鹃 去送一下姑姑,00:27:56.480,00:27:57.980,"Coua, walk Madam Cui out."
00:27:57.840,00:27:58.550,是,00:27:58.040,00:27:59.780,"Yes, My Lady."
00:28:07.680,00:28:08.590,姑姑慢走,00:28:06.680,00:28:08.980,"Take care, Madam."
00:28:15.240,00:28:15.990,菊青,00:28:15.500,00:28:17.280,Daisy?
00:28:17.720,00:28:19.710,这大冷天的站这儿干什么呢,00:28:17.940,00:28:20.480,Why are you standing here on such a freezing day?
00:28:20.320,00:28:21.150,槿汐姑姑,00:28:20.600,00:28:22.400,Madam...
00:28:22.720,00:28:23.630,受委屈了,00:28:22.960,00:28:24.960,What happened?
00:28:25.200,00:28:26.510,小主回来直哭,00:28:24.960,00:28:27.060,My Lady was crying when she came back.
00:28:26.920,00:28:27.990,我才问了一句,,,
00:28:28.280,00:28:30.590,小主就砸了东西赶我出来,00:28:27.120,00:28:31.540,"But when I asked, she smashed the tea cup and sent me out."
00:28:31.400,00:28:34.190,我从没见过小主动过这样大的气,00:28:31.620,00:28:34.700,I have never seen her so angry.
00:28:36.000,00:28:38.190,这做奴才的哪有不受主子气的,00:28:36.260,00:28:38.880,Every master gets angry at their servants.
00:28:39.520,00:28:41.630,陵容小主算是脾气好的了,00:28:39.780,00:28:42.420,Attendant An is one of the most even-tempered.
00:28:42.640,00:28:43.510,快别哭了,00:28:42.760,00:28:44.620,Stop crying.
00:28:44.480,00:28:46.750,回头这脸上要是生了冻疮,00:28:44.620,00:28:48.260,Tears can cause chill burns on your face.
00:28:47.040,00:28:48.110,往后该不好看了,,,
00:28:50.200,00:28:53.110,这玉钗触手生温真是难得,00:28:49.760,00:28:53.960,"What a rarity! The jade on the hairpin
gets warm when you touch it."
00:28:54.560,00:28:57.430,只是小主您得了难道不高兴吗,00:28:54.600,00:28:58.120,"But My Lady, why don't you look pleased?"
00:28:59.360,00:29:01.670,我若赏你你高不高兴,00:28:59.720,00:29:02.360,Would you be happy if I awarded it to you?
00:29:02.280,00:29:03.510,奴婢自然高兴了,00:29:02.360,00:29:04.300,"Of course, My Lady."
00:29:05.400,00:29:09.950,是啊 别人赏你的你自然高兴,00:29:05.400,00:29:10.200,"Indeed, we feel happy when we are rewarded."
00:29:11.080,00:29:12.670,可我与她平起平坐,00:29:10.940,00:29:14.740,"But she and I, we are both His Majesty's concubines."
00:29:13.360,00:29:14.630,同是皇上的嫔妃,,,
00:29:16.200,00:29:19.190,这样好的东西我连见都没见过,00:29:16.440,00:29:19.640,I have never even seen such nice hairpins.
00:29:20.600,00:29:21.670,她却什么都有,00:29:20.900,00:29:23.080,But she has too many.
00:29:22.840,00:29:24.110,知道我不高兴了,,,
00:29:24.760,00:29:27.310,便赏我这个赏我那个,00:29:23.080,00:29:27.660,"So when she knew I was upset, she could easily reward me with this."
00:29:28.040,00:29:29.350,小主您别多心,00:29:28.160,00:29:30.620,"Don't overthink, My Lady."
00:29:30.440,00:29:31.630,我也不想多心,00:29:30.620,00:29:32.680,I don't want to overthink.
00:29:33.120,00:29:34.390,她有好的料子,,,
00:29:35.080,00:29:36.510,高兴了便赏我两匹,00:29:33.540,00:29:37.060,"When she received good fabric,
she rewarded me two pieces at her pleasure."
00:29:37.520,00:29:39.070,她给皇上做的寝衣,00:29:37.780,00:29:40.120,"When we made sleep robes for His Majesty,"
00:29:39.880,00:29:43.310,皇上便说她的料子好 穿着舒服,00:29:40.360,00:29:44.240,"her robe was more comfortable,"
00:29:44.720,00:29:48.150,我的便可以随便铰了送人,00:29:45.040,00:29:48.520,while mine was cut up into a gift.
00:29:50.400,00:29:52.870,如今连淳常在,00:29:50.680,00:29:55.360,"And now, even Attendant Chun can ""climb on top of me""."
00:29:53.240,00:29:54.790,也敢对我蹬鼻子上脸,,,
00:29:56.480,00:29:58.750,还笑话我的绣样小家子气,00:29:56.600,00:29:59.380,She said my embroidery was conservative ...
00:30:00.160,00:30:01.270,登不得台面,00:30:00.400,00:30:02.560,and unpresentable....
00:30:03.080,00:30:04.630,还咒我弧弧单单,00:30:03.060,00:30:05.640,and cursed me to be lonely like the dragon.
00:30:05.440,00:30:07.950,淳常在她年轻 才得宠,00:30:05.880,00:30:10.200,"Attendant Chun is young and newly in favor.
It's understandable that she makes flippant remarks."
00:30:08.200,00:30:09.230,难免沉不住气,,,
00:30:09.920,00:30:11.670,小主您别跟她一般见识,00:30:10.200,00:30:12.320,"My Lady, please don't take her seriously."
00:30:12.240,00:30:14.030,到底莞贵人还是在乎您的,,,
00:30:14.600,00:30:16.550,要不怎么让人送来这玉钗呢,00:30:12.500,00:30:16.900,"Lady Sourire cares a lot about you.
She sent you the jade hairpins."
00:30:17.560,00:30:18.830,她这哪里是为我,00:30:17.600,00:30:20.100,She didn't send them for me.
00:30:20.080,00:30:21.950,她是怕我跟淳常在闹气,,,
00:30:23.000,00:30:24.390,才送这玉钗给我的,00:30:20.240,00:30:25.100,She sent them to me because she doesn't want bad feelings between me and Attendant Chun.
00:30:26.400,00:30:27.510,淳常在说了,,,
00:30:28.160,00:30:31.550,她俩出身差不多 所以亲近些,00:30:26.560,00:30:32.520,"Attendant Chun said they are close
because they had similar family backgrounds."
00:30:33.640,00:30:34.510,我算什么呀,00:30:33.440,00:30:36.080,What am I compared to them?
00:30:36.960,00:30:40.190,莞贵人正是为了护着淳常在,00:30:37.220,00:30:42.520,Lady Sourire sent me this to protect Attendant Chun.
00:30:41.120,00:30:42.270,才送我这个的,,,
00:30:43.960,00:30:44.790,否则的话,,,
00:30:45.640,00:30:46.590,她平日里,00:30:43.640,00:30:49.800,"Otherwise, she wouldn't send me such a valuable gift."
00:30:47.680,00:30:49.430,哪送过我这么贵重的东西,,,
00:30:50.400,00:30:51.750,要照这么说的话,,,
00:30:52.600,00:30:54.910,那莞贵人心里只在意淳常在,00:30:50.500,00:30:55.520,"If so, Lady Sourire only cares about Attendant  Chun."
00:30:56.560,00:30:57.310,也是,,,
00:30:57.640,00:30:59.270,当初沈答应得宠的时候,00:30:56.720,00:30:59.960,"And when Companion Shen was in favor,"
00:30:59.840,00:31:01.870,也没看她顾及过咱们的死活,00:31:00.000,00:31:02.500,she didn't care about us either.
00:31:03.440,00:31:04.670,我算是明白了,00:31:03.640,00:31:05.920,Now I understand --
00:31:06.280,00:31:07.910,若不是沈答应失势,00:31:06.460,00:31:10.660,"she wouldn't help me if Companion Shen
had not fallen from grace."
00:31:09.120,00:31:10.390,她又何尝会帮我,,,
00:31:11.560,00:31:13.070,如今她有了淳常在,00:31:11.660,00:31:13.980,"Now that she has Attendant Chun on her side,"
00:31:14.120,00:31:17.430,就不需要我了 便把我闪了,00:31:14.120,00:31:16.500,she doesn't need me anymore.
00:31:19.160,00:31:20.470,小主若是生气,00:31:16.680,00:31:18.780,She will leave me behind.
00:31:21.120,00:31:22.950,我就把这玉钗收起来便是,00:31:19.520,00:31:23.320,"If you are angry about the hairpins, My Lady,
I will put them into storage."
00:31:23.640,00:31:25.030,免得小主看了心烦,00:31:23.640,00:31:25.820,I don't want them to upset you again.
00:31:25.760,00:31:28.870,这么好的东西赏了我,00:31:25.900,00:31:29.100,She rewarded me such a valuable gift.
00:31:29.800,00:31:30.990,我便好好戴着,00:31:30.080,00:31:32.180,I will wear them nicely.
00:31:32.240,00:31:35.590,否则的话就真的浪费了,00:31:32.540,00:31:36.700,"Otherwise, the hairpins just go to waste."
00:31:38.360,00:31:41.670,对了 你看到槿汐和菊青说话了,00:31:38.300,00:31:41.580,"By the way, you saw Jinxi talking to Daisy?"
00:31:42.000,00:31:43.510,她们聊得可亲切了,00:31:42.180,00:31:44.340,"Yes, they were chatty and cordial."
00:31:44.680,00:31:45.510,我便知道,00:31:44.780,00:31:46.800,"Now I know,"
00:31:46.880,00:31:48.350,若不是她通风报信,00:31:47.180,00:31:49.260,"were it not for Daisy,"
00:31:49.320,00:31:51.110,莞贵人怎么会那么巧,,,
00:31:52.160,00:31:53.070,也跟我一样,00:31:49.500,00:31:55.900,Lady Sourire wouldn't have coincidentally made a robe for His Majesty
00:31:53.960,00:31:57.710,做了件寝衣赠与皇上和我争宠,00:31:56.380,00:31:58.160,to compete for his favor.
00:31:58.120,00:32:01.070,那小主日后更要防着菊青了,00:31:58.320,00:32:02.100,"My Lady, you must be vigilant about Daisy in the future."
00:32:10.360,00:32:12.950,皇上 今儿怎么穿这件旧寝衣了,00:32:10.580,00:32:13.620,Why is Your Majesty wearing this old robe tonight?
00:32:13.680,00:32:15.470,前几日莞贵人和安常在,,,
00:32:15.720,00:32:18.110,不是每人做了一件寝衣给皇上吗,00:32:13.940,00:32:18.560,"Lady Sourire and Attendant An
have sent in new robes to Your Majesty."
00:32:19.880,00:32:22.910,贴身穿的衣裳还是穿久了的好,,,
00:32:24.280,00:32:26.550,舒坦踏实,00:32:20.140,00:32:27.480,"An older robe feels more comfortable.
Wearing it next to the skin brings my mind peace."
00:32:28.480,00:32:31.110,这件寝衣是纯元皇后在的时候,00:32:28.740,00:32:31.960,This robe was made by the Empress Première [her sister].
00:32:31.440,00:32:32.190,给朕做的,,,
00:32:35.720,00:32:38.110,那个时候她给朕做了很多件,00:32:35.940,00:32:38.780,She made quite a few sleep robes for me.
00:32:39.000,00:32:40.950,现在只剩这最后两件了,00:32:39.200,00:32:41.780,But there are only two left now.
00:32:42.320,00:32:45.750,姐姐的针线功夫是数一数二的,00:32:42.360,00:32:46.020,My sister was excellent at needlework.
00:32:46.480,00:32:48.710,时候不早了 睡吧,00:32:46.520,00:32:48.960,Time for bed.
00:32:50.360,00:32:51.110,好吧,00:32:50.760,00:32:52.220,All right
00:32:52.280,00:32:53.590,明儿华妃约了六宫,,,
00:32:53.960,00:32:55.670,一同到清音阁看戏呢,00:32:52.580,00:32:56.180,"Consort Fleur invited all the concubines to
watch operas in the Harmony Theater tomorrow."
00:33:03.720,00:33:06.150,皇后娘娘驾到,00:33:04.460,00:33:07.420,Her Majesty the Empress.
00:33:07.480,00:33:10.310,华妃娘娘驾到,00:33:07.820,00:33:10.560,Her Highness Consort Fleur.
00:33:14.920,00:33:17.790,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:33:15.060,00:33:18.140,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:33:18.240,00:33:20.390,华妃娘娘万安,00:33:18.380,00:33:20.980,Peace to Your Highness.
00:33:21.360,00:33:22.190,都起来吧,00:33:21.280,00:33:22.840,All rise.
00:33:23.080,00:33:24.910,谢皇后娘娘,00:33:23.280,00:33:25.280,I thank Your Majesty.
00:33:35.960,00:33:37.830,今儿都预备了什么戏啊,00:33:36.100,00:33:38.260,What are we watching today?
00:33:38.240,00:33:39.430,回皇后娘娘的话,,,
00:33:39.760,00:33:42.550,是南府戏子唱的刘金定救驾,00:33:38.380,00:33:43.100,"Your Majesty, the South Opera House prepared Liu Jinding's ""The Emperor's Rescue."""
00:33:42.960,00:33:46.310,余下的就是各小主点自己喜欢的,00:33:43.320,00:33:46.660,And they can take requests from their opera listing.
00:33:47.120,00:33:48.350,让他们开唱吧,00:33:47.280,00:33:49.280,Let them begin.
00:33:49.120,00:33:50.870,本宫和皇后先点着,00:33:49.280,00:33:51.920,I and Her Majesty will take our time to order.
00:33:51.640,00:33:52.270,嗻,00:33:51.920,00:33:53.740,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:34:00.160,00:34:01.750,请娘娘先点戏,00:34:00.180,00:34:03.120,"Here is the opera listing, Your Majesty."
00:34:06.040,00:34:09.230,本宫记得有一出极好的鼎峙春秋,00:34:06.240,00:34:12.160,"I remember they have ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" adapted from ""Records of the Three Kingdoms""."
00:34:09.560,00:34:11.150,讲的是三国志的故事,,,
00:34:13.120,00:34:14.510,皇后觉得如何呀,00:34:13.300,00:34:15.840,What does Your Majesty think?
00:34:15.880,00:34:18.110,既然你想看那就先点着吧,00:34:16.040,00:34:18.720,We will watch it if you like.
00:34:19.440,00:34:20.150,姐姐,,,
00:34:20.760,00:34:22.950,华妃娘娘抢在皇后娘娘前头啊,00:34:19.700,00:34:23.860,"Sourire, how can Consort Fleur order before Her Majesty?"
00:34:24.000,00:34:25.910,这出戏热闹你喜欢看,00:34:24.180,00:34:26.960,It's a good show. You will like it.
00:34:37.000,00:34:40.510,那臣妾再点一出薛丁山征西吧,00:34:37.080,00:34:41.000,"I'll choose ""Xue Dingshan's Expedition to the West""."
00:34:41.640,00:34:43.870,华妃娘娘的兄长战功赫赫,00:34:42.100,00:34:44.520,Your Highness's brother achieved spectacular feats on the battlefields.
00:34:44.320,00:34:46.310,恰如唐朝大将薛丁山,,,
00:34:46.720,00:34:49.030,征西成功扬名千古,00:34:44.600,00:34:48.920,"Just like the Great General Xue Dingshan of Tang Dynasty,
who is remembered through the ages."
00:34:49.840,00:34:51.710,曹贵人可真会说话呀,00:34:49.800,00:34:52.260,"That's very sweet of you, Lady Cao."
00:34:52.480,00:34:53.350,娘娘点吧,00:34:52.560,00:34:54.660,Your Majesty should order a show.
00:34:54.960,00:34:57.350,本宫只喜欢看劝善金科,00:34:55.060,00:34:58.180,"My favorite is the ""Persuasion to Good-doing""."
00:34:57.840,00:34:59.750,再点一本瑶台就是了,00:34:58.400,00:35:00.500,"I'll order that and ""Yaotai""."
00:35:01.280,00:35:02.790,娘娘仁心善行,,,
00:35:03.560,00:35:06.390,恰如瑶台慈母福泽天下,00:35:01.460,00:35:06.380,"Your Majesty is like the benevolent Mother Yaotai
who brings blessings to the world."
00:35:07.360,00:35:09.950,劝善金科讲的是目莲救母,00:35:07.640,00:35:10.540,"""The Persuasion to Good-doing"" is adapted from the folk story about Mulian rescuing his mother."
00:35:10.520,00:35:13.670,恰如三阿哥对你一番孝心,00:35:10.540,00:35:12.320,[the story condemns rebellion]
,,,00:35:12.320,00:35:14.680,The Third Prince is a filial son like Mulian.
00:35:14.560,00:35:18.110,本宫记得齐妃手中的平金手炉,00:35:14.840,00:35:20.600,"Consort Astuce, the Pingjin embroidered hand warmer you are
using was a gift from your son, the Third Prince."
00:35:18.640,00:35:19.990,是三阿哥送的吧,,,
00:35:20.680,00:35:22.030,华妃好记性啊,00:35:20.920,00:35:23.500,"You have a good memory, Consort Fleur."
00:35:23.440,00:35:25.710,三阿哥就是孝心太重,00:35:23.980,00:35:26.700,I hope he has more than just filial piety.
00:35:26.400,00:35:28.590,若是花些心思在读书上,,,
00:35:29.120,00:35:30.750,皇上也少生些气了,00:35:26.820,00:35:31.140,"His Majesty would be less upset if the
Third Prince would spend more time on his studies."
00:35:39.880,00:35:42.630,妹妹今日这身衣裳可真漂亮,00:35:40.040,00:35:43.200,"Fleur, you look gorgeous in this dress."
00:35:43.680,00:35:45.470,赤金红宝的首饰,,,
00:35:45.760,00:35:47.830,衬得妹妹你华贵大方,00:35:43.760,00:35:47.740,The gold and ruby headress also complement your style.
00:35:48.280,00:35:49.750,真的非常夺目啊,00:35:48.500,00:35:50.500,It's a lustrous outfit.
00:35:51.920,00:35:54.230,臣妾怕姜忠敏管内务府没多久,00:35:52.180,00:35:55.900,"I was afraid that under Jiang Zhongmin's leadership, the
Household Department would be incapable of making good outfits."
00:35:54.640,00:35:55.550,做不出好东西来,,,
00:35:56.200,00:35:57.190,特意托哥哥,,,
00:35:57.480,00:35:59.230,在外面的珍宝斋赶做的,00:35:56.100,00:35:59.600,I asked my brother to order it from the Treasure House in town.
00:35:59.920,00:36:01.790,前些日子拿来一瞧呢,,,
00:36:02.080,00:36:04.030,这金线制得还是不够密,00:36:00.180,00:36:04.080,I still found the gold threads woven a bit too loosely although
00:36:04.480,00:36:07.030,说是十几位老师傅赶制出来的,00:36:04.680,00:36:07.200,I heard it was made tirelessly by over ten senior weavers.
00:36:07.400,00:36:09.550,只比内务府的好那么一丁点,00:36:07.400,00:36:10.540,"It's just a wee bit finer than what
the Household Department makes."
00:36:10.920,00:36:11.990,将就着戴吧,00:36:10.840,00:36:13.280,I'll just have to wear what I have.
00:36:12.560,00:36:15.630,如此名贵 怕要价不菲吧,00:36:13.480,00:36:15.900,"Such a luxurious outfit is quite expensive, isn't it?"
00:36:15.920,00:36:17.350,其实若是东西好呢,,,
00:36:17.920,00:36:19.590,银钱又算得了什么,00:36:16.100,00:36:19.900,The price comes second to the quality.
00:36:20.560,00:36:22.950,皇后娘娘也太过精打细算了,00:36:20.500,00:36:23.900,Your Majesty should not always be counting pennies.
00:36:23.960,00:36:26.550,家大业大 不能不多问一句,00:36:24.100,00:36:27.640,It's my duty to carefully manage such a grand household.
00:36:32.040,00:36:34.550,其实若能衬出妹妹的风华绝代,00:36:32.300,00:36:37.260,"I wouldn't mind the price if an outfit can
complement your unrivaled beauty."
00:36:35.080,00:36:36.790,银钱是不必计较的,,,
00:36:38.400,00:36:40.310,皇后能说出这样的话,,,
00:36:40.600,00:36:41.830,臣妾真是欣慰,00:36:38.560,00:36:42.540,I'm really gratified to hear Your Majesty say so.
00:36:42.880,00:36:44.230,早说皇后前些日子,,,
00:36:44.560,00:36:46.030,因为臣妾宫中开销大,00:36:43.300,00:36:48.600,I heard that Your Majesty tattled on me for my additional spending.
00:36:46.400,00:36:47.910,在皇上那儿告了一状,,,
00:36:48.720,00:36:50.550,其实臣妾开销再大,,,
00:36:50.920,00:36:53.750,皇后娘娘都不必如此肉痛的,00:36:49.020,00:36:53.780,Your Majesty doesn't have to worry over the money I spend.
00:36:54.640,00:36:56.630,那是臣妾自己的事情,00:36:54.720,00:36:57.280,It's none of your concern.
00:36:57.320,00:36:59.110,无论超出月例银子多少,,,
00:36:59.760,00:37:01.790,臣妾都会让娘家悉数补上的,00:36:57.460,00:37:02.440,My family will cover all the additional spending for me.
00:37:06.080,00:37:08.390,妹妹能有这份心体恤本宫,00:37:06.480,00:37:10.500,I'm glad that you are so understanding.
00:37:08.840,00:37:10.190,本宫很是欣慰呀,,,
00:37:11.280,00:37:13.350,希望有华妃这份表率,,,
00:37:13.640,00:37:14.910,诸位姐妹都能懂得,00:37:11.620,00:37:17.120,I hope all of you can learn from Consort Fleur that each thread and every stitch is hard-earned.
00:37:15.280,00:37:16.870,一针一线来之不易,,,
00:37:17.240,00:37:20.150,若不能做到开源 也可节流些许,00:37:17.480,00:37:21.280,"If you don't have more sources of income,
you can reduce expenditure instead."
00:37:26.400,00:37:30.470,多谢皇后娘娘教诲 臣妾受教,00:37:26.420,00:37:30.980,"I humbly thank Your Majesty.
I will follow your advice."
00:37:30.720,00:37:31.950,好了都起来吧,00:37:31.200,00:37:32.700,"All right, you may rise."
00:37:32.320,00:37:33.590,谢皇后娘娘,00:37:32.700,00:37:34.700,I thank Your Majesty.
00:37:42.680,00:37:44.310,说起薛丁山征西,,,
00:37:45.000,00:37:46.590,倒不得不提这樊梨花了,00:37:42.800,00:37:47.220,"Speaking of Xue Dingshan's Expedition to the West,
we always think about Fan Lihua."
00:37:47.440,00:37:48.630,你说这樊梨花,00:37:47.560,00:37:49.440,Look at her!
00:37:49.400,00:37:51.310,千方百计地讨夫君喜欢,00:37:49.620,00:37:52.000,She makes every effort to please her husband.
00:37:51.960,00:37:54.070,可是她夫君只真心喜欢别人,00:37:52.160,00:37:54.560,But her husband only has another woman in his heart
00:37:54.680,00:37:56.350,休了樊梨花三次,00:37:54.700,00:37:57.060,and declares a divorce three times.
00:37:57.120,00:37:58.790,本宫若是樊梨花,,,
00:37:59.400,00:38:00.950,宁可下堂求去,00:37:57.280,00:38:04.420,"If I were her, I would rather leave him than staying with his loveless body."
00:38:01.520,00:38:02.790,总比眼睁睁看着夫君,,,
00:38:03.080,00:38:04.430,人在心不在的强,,,
00:38:05.960,00:38:08.630,做得正妻就要有容人的雅量,00:38:06.120,00:38:09.540,A primary wife has to tolerate the concubines.
00:38:09.440,00:38:11.590,夫君再宠爱妾室也好,,,
00:38:12.360,00:38:14.070,正妻就是正妻,00:38:09.700,00:38:14.460,"And the primary wife is the only wife, no matter how much her husband favors the concubines."
00:38:14.960,00:38:18.310,即便是薛丁山休了樊梨花三次,00:38:15.320,00:38:21.060,"Even though Xue Dingshan divorces her three times,
he also pleads three times for her return."
00:38:18.760,00:38:20.750,还不是要三请樊梨花吗,,,
00:38:22.760,00:38:25.070,到底是那樊梨花有身家,00:38:23.020,00:38:26.160,That is all because of her powerful family.
00:38:26.000,00:38:28.710,出身西凉将门的嫡出女儿,00:38:26.480,00:38:29.620,"She is the daughter of the primary wife
of a Western Turkic general."
00:38:31.720,00:38:33.550,若是换做庶出女儿,00:38:31.000,00:38:36.200,"If she was the daughter of a secondary wife,
 without ""the power to move mountains and seas"","
00:38:34.400,00:38:36.790,再没有这移山倒海的本事,,,
00:38:37.360,00:38:38.990,那可真是死头一条了,00:38:36.500,00:38:40.020,she could not expect anything but death.
00:38:45.000,00:38:46.550,您说是不是啊娘娘,00:38:45.000,00:38:47.680,Does Your Majesty agree?
00:38:56.320,00:38:57.110,皇后娘娘,,,
00:38:58.520,00:39:00.230,咱们再点一出南柯记好不好,00:38:56.000,00:39:00.580,"Your Majesty, can we also watch the ""Dream of Nanke""?"
00:39:01.040,00:39:01.670,姐姐,,,
00:39:01.880,00:39:03.990,您这戏闹了半天只为做个梦,00:39:01.000,00:39:04.900,"Sourie, that is just about a dream after all the drama."
00:39:04.400,00:39:05.150,多没趣啊,00:39:04.900,00:39:05.900,What's the fun of that?
00:39:05.880,00:39:08.110,看戏不为有趣更为警醒世人,00:39:06.080,00:39:09.760,"We watch an opera not only for fun,
but also for the lesson from the story."
00:39:09.520,00:39:12.110,眼看他高楼起眼看他高楼塌,00:39:10.000,00:39:12.500,"""I see his house uprise;
I see his house collapse."""
00:39:12.640,00:39:15.030,越是显赫就越容易登高跌重,00:39:12.500,00:39:15.240,A fall is worse from a more elevated position.
00:39:15.640,00:39:18.270,人去楼空 谁还管嫡庶贵贱,00:39:15.500,00:39:18.400,"Once his house collapses and his guests are gone,
who would even care about his parentage?"
00:39:18.680,00:39:20.030,谁还分钱财权势,00:39:18.500,00:39:20.380,Who would care about wealth and power?
00:39:20.440,00:39:21.790,不过是南柯一梦而已,00:39:20.380,00:39:22.880,It's all a dream of Nanke.
00:39:25.240,00:39:28.470,同是看戏 莞贵人便多有心得,00:39:25.000,00:39:28.320,I appreciate Lady Sourire's reflections on the opera.
00:39:28.920,00:39:31.310,难怪皇上这么喜欢和你说话,00:39:28.500,00:39:31.500,No wonder His Majesty enjoys talking to you.
00:39:31.920,00:39:33.670,臣妾不过是就事论事罢了,00:39:32.340,00:39:35.080,I was simply talking about the story.
00:39:36.160,00:39:38.790,臣妾也以为守得云开见月明,00:39:36.400,00:39:39.460,"I also believe that ""the clouds will clear for a bright moon""."
00:39:39.240,00:39:41.990,凡事最重要的是两心相悦最要紧,00:39:39.460,00:39:42.620,What matters is the mutual love between two hearts.
00:39:42.840,00:39:44.710,安常在好歹也是嫔妃,00:39:43.140,00:39:45.480,"Attendant An, as His Majesty's concubine,"
00:39:45.360,00:39:47.350,怎么连两心相悦这样的话,,,
00:39:47.680,00:39:50.150,在大庭广众之下都说得毫不脸红,00:39:45.500,00:39:50.420,"how can you declare ""mutual love"" openly in public?"
00:39:50.680,00:39:51.910,这脸皮厚起来,,,
00:39:52.560,00:39:54.470,还真算是难得的本事啊,00:39:51.000,00:39:55.260,It's almost a talent to have such thick skin.
00:39:58.480,00:39:59.990,牡丹亭的戏文上说,00:39:58.800,00:40:00.700,"The Peony Pavilion writes,"
00:40:00.480,00:40:02.470,情不知所起一往情深,00:40:00.800,00:40:03.180,"""Love springs from an unknown origin
and courses deep to an infinite end. """
00:40:02.800,00:40:04.950,生者可以死 死者可以生,00:40:03.180,00:40:05.880,"""It empowers the alive to die,
