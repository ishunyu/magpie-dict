00:02:39.160,00:02:40.300,莫不是本宫的身子,,,
00:02:40.680,00:02:41.900,还有什么不妥的地方,00:02:39.880,00:02:43.460,Is there anything wrong with my health?
00:02:44.480,00:02:46.750,娘娘 您用过麝香,00:02:45.080,00:02:47.720,Your Highness has consumed musk.
00:02:47.200,00:02:47.870,麝香,00:02:48.000,00:02:49.440,Musk?
00:02:49.200,00:02:51.660,章太医说过本宫孕中禁用此物,00:02:49.940,00:02:52.520,Dr. Zhang told me that musk is forbidden in my palace.
00:02:51.960,00:02:52.910,本宫怎么会用呢,,,
00:02:53.160,00:02:54.220,可是娘娘的贵体,00:02:52.800,00:02:54.000,Why would I use it?
00:02:54.520,00:02:56.070,的确有用过麝香的症状,00:02:54.000,00:02:56.820,But Your Highness's noble body shows signs of using musk.
00:02:56.600,00:02:57.550,只是分量很少,,,
00:02:58.200,00:02:59.310,不容易察觉而已,00:02:57.260,00:03:00.240,"It's a small amount, not easily noticeable."
00:03:00.920,00:03:01.900,本宫并没有,00:03:01.720,00:03:03.080,I did not use it.
00:03:06.000,00:03:06.830,这些日子,00:03:06.660,00:03:08.140,"These days,"
00:03:08.960,00:03:11.070,本宫只在一处闻到过香料的气味,00:03:09.800,00:03:12.460,I have only been exposed to incense in one place.
00:03:14.080,00:03:16.270,流朱 明日你去内务府,00:03:15.040,00:03:17.440,"Vermilion, go to the Household Department tomorrow"
00:03:16.920,00:03:18.790,想办法弄些年妃宫里的欢宜香来,00:03:17.800,00:03:20.040,and try to get some Pleasancy incense.
00:03:20.160,00:03:20.750,是,00:03:21.040,00:03:22.080,Yes.
00:03:22.240,00:03:24.670,娘娘这番病固然是因为小产伤身,00:03:23.100,00:03:25.740,Your Highness has been unwell not only because of the miscarriage
00:03:25.400,00:03:27.310,但更多是因为伤心太过,00:03:26.060,00:03:27.340,but also unrestrained sadness.
00:03:27.640,00:03:29.550,五内郁结 肝火虚旺所致,00:03:27.740,00:03:30.760,"The sadness caused stagnation of the five
 organs, and deficient fire in the Liver."
00:03:30.320,00:03:32.880,请恕微臣直言 这是心病,00:03:30.900,00:03:34.000,This has created an imbalance in your emotions.
00:03:34.720,00:03:35.860,良医能治百病,00:03:35.580,00:03:37.500,"Good doctors can treat physical illnesses,"
00:03:37.160,00:03:39.070,但华佗再世也难治心病,00:03:38.100,00:03:40.580,but even the best doctors cannot treat the feelings of the heart.
00:03:40.640,00:03:42.150,本宫无心药可解,00:03:41.460,00:03:43.300,There is no cure for my heart.
00:03:43.200,00:03:44.420,就由着它病着吧,00:03:44.140,00:03:45.580,Just let it be.
00:03:45.560,00:03:47.230,娘娘的病需要慢慢调理,00:03:46.440,00:03:48.240,It will take time for Your Highness's health to be restored.
00:03:47.560,00:03:49.030,吃太多的药也没有好处,00:03:48.400,00:03:50.160,Too much medicine is not helpful.
00:03:49.520,00:03:51.030,不如饮一些莲心茶吧,00:03:50.400,00:03:52.240,Your Highness can take lotus seed-core tea.
00:03:51.680,00:03:53.670,莲心味苦性寒 能治心热,00:03:52.340,00:03:54.880,"It is bitter and cold-natured
and will reduce the heat in the Heart."
00:03:54.160,00:03:54.750,有清心,,,
00:03:55.000,00:03:56.950,安抚烦躁和祛火气的效用,00:03:54.900,00:03:57.900,"Relieving internal heat will restore balance and calm,"
00:03:57.600,00:03:59.390,娘娘您用来最为适宜了,00:03:58.440,00:04:00.720,which will benefit Your Highness.
00:04:00.680,00:04:04.190,莲心 是很苦的东西,00:04:01.400,00:04:05.040,The lotus seed-cores ... are very bitter.
00:04:05.320,00:04:06.510,希望莲心的苦,00:04:06.200,00:04:07.940,Bitter is the flavor of the Heart.
00:04:07.280,00:04:09.190,可以抚平娘娘心中的苦,00:04:08.160,00:04:10.700,Bitterness will nourish the Heart and soothe Your Highness's emotions.
00:04:14.560,00:04:16.430,问莲根有丝多少,00:04:15.200,00:04:17.300,"""I ask the lotus why their roots are entwined"""
00:04:16.880,00:04:17.860,心为谁苦,00:04:17.620,00:04:19.120,"""and why their heart is bitter."""
00:04:19.200,00:04:20.670,双花脉脉相问,00:04:20.020,00:04:22.000,"""The two lotus flowers look towards each other fondly."""
00:04:21.400,00:04:22.750,只是旧时儿女,00:04:22.220,00:04:24.780,"""They are a loving couple who drowned with wishes unfulfilled."""
00:04:24.440,00:04:27.000,娘娘 您可还记得这首曲子,00:04:25.400,00:04:27.960,Does Your Highness remember the story?
00:04:28.160,00:04:31.190,小时候的歌 大人还记得,00:04:28.980,00:04:32.180,"You still remember the childhood song, Dr. Wen."
00:04:34.520,00:04:35.990,小允子 莞嫔呢,00:04:35.280,00:04:36.960,"Xiao-Yunzi, where's Concubine Sourire?"
00:04:36.240,00:04:37.670,在里头歇息呢 温太医来了,00:04:36.960,00:04:38.800,My Lady is inside. Dr. Wen has come to visit her.
00:04:38.400,00:04:39.190,我进去瞧瞧,,,
00:04:40.600,00:04:41.950,我第一次见到你的时候,00:04:39.160,00:04:40.740,I will go join them.
00:04:42.400,00:04:43.590,你在湖心泛舟,00:04:41.360,00:04:43.060,"The first time I met you,"
00:04:44.120,00:04:45.390,怀里抱满了莲蓬,00:04:43.160,00:04:46.080,you were on a boat collecting flowering lotus pods.
00:04:46.000,00:04:47.670,当时唱的就是这首曲子,00:04:46.800,00:04:48.980,And this was the song you were singing.
00:04:49.560,00:04:51.150,那个时候我的心里就想,00:04:50.340,00:04:52.480,"When I saw you, my child's heart wished"
00:04:52.880,00:04:55.070,长大了以后我一定要娶你为妻,00:04:53.560,00:04:56.280,that I would marry you when I grew up.
00:04:57.280,00:04:59.630,可谁知你有着凤凰的翅膀,00:04:58.100,00:05:00.560,But I didn't know you had the wings of a phoenix.
00:05:00.400,00:05:01.950,怎是我一介小小的太医,,,
00:05:02.240,00:05:03.150,可以束缚的,00:05:01.140,00:05:03.840,You were not to be the wife of a humble doctor.
00:05:04.000,00:05:05.390,可是看你如今的样子,00:05:04.860,00:05:06.260,But seeing you like this ...
00:05:05.640,00:05:06.910,我真是 温大人失言了,00:05:06.400,00:05:07.900,"You misspeak, Dr. Wen."
00:05:09.240,00:05:11.230,本宫感激温大人的情意,00:05:10.000,00:05:12.340,I am grateful for the fondness in your heart.
00:05:12.760,00:05:14.910,但本宫心里一直把你当作,,,
00:05:15.240,00:05:16.630,自己的亲哥哥一样看待,00:05:13.440,00:05:17.260,"Nevertheless, I have always seen you as my brother."
00:05:18.280,00:05:19.110,并无他想,00:05:19.160,00:05:20.560,No more than that.
00:05:21.280,00:05:22.030,眉姐姐,00:05:22.120,00:05:23.400,Meizhuang.
00:05:26.240,00:05:28.430,本来约了安妹妹一起来看你,00:05:27.100,00:05:29.340,Lingrong was going to come here with me ...
00:05:28.840,00:05:30.390,谁知她被皇后叫走,00:05:29.580,00:05:31.420,but she was summoned by Her Majesty.
00:05:30.880,00:05:32.230,我就一个人来看了,00:05:31.680,00:05:33.320,So I came by myself.
00:05:33.120,00:05:36.150,你 你好生歇着吧,00:05:33.760,00:05:35.120,You ...
,,,00:05:35.940,00:05:38.160,You should have a good rest.
00:05:40.800,00:05:41.510,小主,00:05:41.620,00:05:42.760,My Lady.
00:05:44.120,00:05:45.230,小主怎么出来了,00:05:44.800,00:05:46.100,"My Lady, why did you not stay?"
00:05:45.520,00:05:46.390,脸色这么难看,00:05:46.180,00:05:47.140,You look upset.
00:05:47.320,00:05:48.870,也请大人别再说这样的话了,00:05:48.000,00:05:49.780,Please don't say anything like that again.
00:05:50.320,00:05:51.630,否则便是置彼此,,,
00:05:52.200,00:05:53.420,于万劫不复之地了,00:05:51.160,00:05:54.400,"It would only lead you and I into ""an abyss of no return""."
00:05:54.760,00:05:55.350,是,00:05:55.560,00:05:56.480,Yes.
00:06:13.520,00:06:14.190,娘娘,00:06:14.340,00:06:15.520,Your Highness.
00:06:15.720,00:06:16.590,你去问了吗,00:06:16.440,00:06:17.780,Did you ask ?
00:06:17.160,00:06:19.030,敬事房把本宫的牌子挂上了吗,00:06:17.900,00:06:20.080,Did Attendance Services send in my name tag?
00:06:19.520,00:06:20.630,敬事房的人说,00:06:20.260,00:06:21.560,They said
00:06:21.240,00:06:22.380,没有皇上的口谕,00:06:21.920,00:06:23.560,they could not do it
00:06:23.040,00:06:25.670,娘娘侍寝的牌子还不能挂上去,00:06:23.900,00:06:26.380,without His Majesty's permission.
00:06:26.600,00:06:28.980,可是本宫现在身子明明已经好了,00:06:27.460,00:06:29.840,But I have recovered from heatstroke ...
00:06:30.520,00:06:32.870,难道皇上再也不想见本宫了吗,00:06:31.300,00:06:33.740,Does His Majesty really not want to see me anymore?
00:06:33.280,00:06:33.990,真不是,00:06:34.120,00:06:35.300,It's not that.
00:06:34.600,00:06:36.230,奴婢问过敬事房的人了,00:06:35.420,00:06:37.060,I asked Attendance Services.
00:06:36.480,00:06:38.150,这些日子别说是娘娘,00:06:37.220,00:06:38.900,It's not only Your Highness.
00:06:38.360,00:06:40.590,皇上根本就没有召幸过任何嫔妃,00:06:39.040,00:06:41.040,His Majesty hasn't visited any concubines recently.
00:06:40.920,00:06:42.750,只是一个人在养心殿住,00:06:41.540,00:06:43.600,He just stays at the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:06:43.120,00:06:44.030,不会,00:06:43.900,00:06:44.880,No.
00:06:45.080,00:06:47.150,皇上一定是还在生本宫的气,00:06:45.880,00:06:47.960,His Majesty is still mad at me.
00:06:48.840,00:06:49.950,可是莞嫔小产,00:06:49.700,00:06:51.420,But I had no intention
00:06:51.200,00:06:52.710,本宫也不是存心的,00:06:52.000,00:06:53.920,to cause Concubine Sourire's miscarriage.
00:06:53.120,00:06:55.030,皇上怎么会生娘娘的气呢,00:06:53.980,00:06:55.860,How can His Majesty be mad at Your Highness?
00:06:55.320,00:06:57.070,皇上再未提过莞嫔之事,00:06:56.120,00:06:58.160,His Majesty never mentioned the miscarriage again
00:06:57.600,00:06:59.510,娘娘妃位上应有的赏赐棒禄,,,
00:06:59.920,00:07:00.750,皇上一样都不少,00:06:58.520,00:07:02.900,"and Your Highness has been receiving
the stipends and rewards due to a Consort."
00:07:01.000,00:07:02.350,照旧还是给娘娘了,,,
00:07:02.600,00:07:04.190,也从未禁过娘娘的足啊,00:07:03.300,00:07:05.600,"Also, His Majesty didn't confine Your Highness."
00:07:05.200,00:07:07.110,如今本宫封号褫夺,00:07:05.820,00:07:07.740,But my honorary name was removed.
00:07:07.760,00:07:09.110,位分在端妃和敬妃,,,
00:07:09.480,00:07:10.670,那两个贱人之下,00:07:08.420,00:07:11.380,"Now my rank is below the two wretches
Consort Estime and Consort Honnête."
00:07:11.360,00:07:12.950,还有何颜面出宫,00:07:12.100,00:07:14.300,I don't have the face to leave my palace.
00:07:14.960,00:07:16.870,皇上让本宫思过,00:07:15.980,00:07:17.980,His Majesty asked me to reflect on my fault.
00:07:18.400,00:07:19.990,本宫又何过之有,00:07:19.240,00:07:21.040,But what did I do wrong?
00:07:21.000,00:07:23.460,娘娘 您一夜一夜熬着不睡,00:07:21.720,00:07:24.580,"Your Highness has been staying up late, one night after another."
00:07:23.920,00:07:25.030,人都熬瘦了,,,
00:07:25.440,00:07:26.870,即便皇上真要召见,00:07:24.780,00:07:25.980,You look unwell.
00:07:27.400,00:07:28.990,您也不能就这样见哪,00:07:26.380,00:07:30.000,"If His Majesty summons you,
you can’t meet him like this."
00:07:30.000,00:07:30.630,果真,00:07:30.860,00:07:31.920,Really?
00:07:32.680,00:07:35.510,本宫如今面容憔悴,00:07:33.420,00:07:36.260,I look haggard?
00:07:40.520,00:07:43.470,既然这样 我还如何见皇上,00:07:41.420,00:07:44.280,How could I see His Majesty looking like this?
00:07:44.560,00:07:47.230,颂芝 陪本宫去上妆,00:07:45.340,00:07:48.020,"Song Zhi, do my makeup."
00:07:53.520,00:07:54.350,算了,00:07:54.360,00:07:55.480,Forget it.
00:07:55.600,00:07:56.740,皇上又不来,00:07:56.520,00:07:58.120,His Majesty won’t come.
00:07:57.800,00:08:02.950,本宫再娇艳 又给谁看呢,00:07:58.720,00:07:59.660,Who ...
,,,00:08:02.680,00:08:04.360,do I adorn myself for?
00:08:06.600,00:08:08.750,姐姐还是要好好保重自己的身子,00:08:07.640,00:08:09.900,"Sourire, you have to put your health first."
00:08:10.960,00:08:12.950,小主 您让我取的香拿来了,00:08:11.800,00:08:13.640,"My Lady, I have the incense you asked for."
00:08:13.440,00:08:14.150,好难得啊,00:08:14.300,00:08:15.240,It wasn't easy to get.
00:08:14.400,00:08:16.510,是姜公公特意去香药局取的,00:08:15.380,00:08:17.620,Mr. Jiang had to get it from the Spice Dispensary.
00:08:16.960,00:08:19.110,他还说皇上特意嘱咐,,,
00:08:19.360,00:08:21.740,这香除了翊坤宫别的宫都不许用,00:08:17.800,00:08:22.700,"He said this incense can only be used in the Palace
 of Earthly Honor, by His Majesty's order."
00:08:22.520,00:08:23.870,还好年妃最近用得少,,,
00:08:24.120,00:08:24.990,剩下了这些,00:08:23.460,00:08:25.700,"Fortunately, Consort Nian hasn't been using a lot of it."
00:08:26.240,00:08:28.510,陵容你最懂香料 帮我看看,00:08:27.160,00:08:28.700,"Lingrong, you are an expert at spices."
00:08:28.840,00:08:29.820,这香有什么不妥,00:08:28.840,00:08:31.020,Please check if there’s anything strange with it.
00:08:33.280,00:08:34.470,借姐姐的护甲一用,00:08:34.220,00:08:35.960,May I use your nail guard?
00:08:47.200,00:08:51.550,里面有青蕾 首信,00:08:48.080,00:08:49.980,"It contains patchouli,"
,,,00:08:51.820,00:08:52.920,"clover,"
00:08:52.680,00:08:54.310,甘松 白檀 丁子,00:08:53.620,00:08:55.640,"sweet pine, white sandalwood, clove"
00:08:58.160,00:08:58.950,煎香,00:08:58.980,00:09:00.180,roasted agarwood
00:09:04.200,00:09:04.910,怎么了,00:09:05.140,00:09:06.180,What’s wrong?
00:09:09.920,00:09:11.030,还有一味麝香,00:09:10.820,00:09:12.100,and musk.
00:09:13.120,00:09:14.990,且这应该是马麝身上的麝香,00:09:13.500,00:09:15.780,This comes from alpine musk deer.
00:09:16.000,00:09:17.110,而且是当门子,00:09:16.200,00:09:19.020,"It is Dangmenzi - pelleted musk, not powdered."
00:09:18.600,00:09:21.390,这种马麝唯有西北大雪山才有,00:09:19.480,00:09:22.580,Alpine musk deer only live in the snowy mountains of the Northwest.
00:09:22.080,00:09:22.950,＋分金贵,,,
00:09:23.880,00:09:25.100,药力也比普通的麝香,00:09:22.920,00:09:24.260,It is a precious spice.
00:09:25.360,00:09:26.420,强上十倍不止,00:09:24.880,00:09:27.400,And it is ten times stronger than normal musk.
00:09:30.800,00:09:31.510,姐姐,00:09:31.780,00:09:32.840,Sourire.
00:09:33.480,00:09:34.540,这到底是什么,00:09:34.120,00:09:35.440,What is this?
00:09:34.800,00:09:35.780,姐姐从哪里来的,00:09:35.660,00:09:36.920,Where did you get it from?
00:09:38.080,00:09:39.870,这是翊坤宫独用的欢宜香,00:09:38.440,00:09:41.720,"This is Pleasancy, the incense exclusively
 used by the Palace of Earthly Honor."
00:09:41.240,00:09:43.110,年妃承宠多年 久久不孕,00:09:42.160,00:09:44.160,Consort Nian has never been pregnant over the years ...
00:09:44.440,00:09:45.750,这才是真正的关窍,00:09:44.540,00:09:47.300,This is the real reason why.
00:09:48.880,00:09:50.750,姐姐当日为何会在年妃宫中,,,
00:09:51.080,00:09:52.110,骤然胎动不安,00:09:49.720,00:09:52.980,Your pregnancy suddenly became unstable that day in her palace ...
00:09:53.120,00:09:55.030,为何会跪上半个时辰便小产,00:09:54.080,00:09:56.120,and miscarried after kneeling for just an hour ...
00:09:56.960,00:09:58.350,姐姐虽身子弱些,00:09:57.920,00:09:59.900,"Although you have a weak constitution,"
00:09:59.880,00:10:00.750,可安知,,,
00:10:01.040,00:10:02.870,没有皇上这味欢宜香的缘故,00:10:00.640,00:10:03.640,without the effects of His Majesty's Pleasancy ...
00:10:05.480,00:10:06.460,皇上,00:10:06.300,00:10:07.280,Your Majesty.
00:10:08.240,00:10:09.350,你要防她,00:10:09.000,00:10:10.820,You were on guard against her.
00:10:10.720,00:10:12.670,岂知也伤了我们的孩子,00:10:11.620,00:10:13.580,But it ended up harming our child.
00:10:13.480,00:10:15.780,姐姐 女子不能用麝香,00:10:14.220,00:10:16.500,"Sourire, we know that women shouldn’t use musk"
00:10:16.560,00:10:18.230,久用此物不能受孕,00:10:17.560,00:10:19.300,because it can lead to infertility.
00:10:18.640,00:10:21.070,即使有孕也多半是小产或死胎,00:10:19.540,00:10:22.520,"And it can cause miscarriage or
even stillbirth."
00:10:22.880,00:10:24.350,我虽生性喜欢焚香,00:10:23.860,00:10:25.640,"Although I'm given to burning incense,"
00:10:25.080,00:10:27.590,但是对麝香却是绝对敬而远之,00:10:26.000,00:10:29.400,I would never add even a little musk.
00:10:27.880,00:10:28.860,一点也不敢沾的,,,
00:10:29.880,00:10:33.190,那么这么重的麝香,00:10:30.680,00:10:31.980,So ...
00:10:33.720,00:10:34.940,竟无人发觉吗,00:10:32.780,00:10:34.120,It contains so much musk
,,,00:10:34.620,00:10:36.080,but no one has ever noticed?
00:10:36.480,00:10:37.990,当门子药力虽最强,00:10:37.320,00:10:38.980,"Dangmenzi has the strongest effect,"
00:10:38.560,00:10:39.620,香味却不甚浓,00:10:39.500,00:10:40.740,but has a light odor.
00:10:40.920,00:10:43.300,而且这欢宜香中,,,
00:10:43.720,00:10:45.750,用别的香料调和得非常好,00:10:41.820,00:10:46.260,And a variety of spices have been blended into Pleasancy.
00:10:46.560,00:10:48.270,若非行家细闻细验,,,
00:10:49.080,00:10:51.670,在焚烧时是断断不会发觉的,00:10:47.380,00:10:52.180,"The presence of musk would go unnoticed
unless an expert closely examines it."
00:10:53.680,00:10:55.980,姐姐到底是如何发现其中关窍的,00:10:54.520,00:10:57.080,Why did you suspect there's something wrong with the incense?
00:10:56.840,00:10:57.870,太医说我,,,
00:10:58.680,00:11:00.670,身上似有用过麝香的症状,00:10:57.640,00:11:01.180,The doctor said that I showed signs of using musk.
00:11:02.280,00:11:03.790,而我自有身孕之后,,,
00:11:04.320,00:11:05.670,便不再用过香料,00:11:03.220,00:11:06.080,"But after I got pregnant, I stopped using perfumes."
00:11:06.400,00:11:07.430,所以奇怪,00:11:07.240,00:11:08.660,So I was wondering why.
00:11:09.520,00:11:11.590,这种麝香药力十分强,00:11:10.420,00:11:12.500,"This type of musk is very forceful,"
00:11:12.400,00:11:13.950,在人身上无孔不入,00:11:13.280,00:11:15.180,and easily finds a way to enter your body.
00:11:15.000,00:11:16.030,皇上离宫后,00:11:15.920,00:11:17.360,"After His Majesty left the palace,"
00:11:16.760,00:11:18.670,年妃常召姐姐去翊坤宫,00:11:17.680,00:11:19.820,Consort Nian frequently summoned you to her palace.
00:11:19.640,00:11:20.350,如此,,,
00:11:20.720,00:11:23.180,姐姐身上便有用过麝香的迹象,00:11:20.580,00:11:23.740,That’s why you show signs of using musk.
00:11:27.360,00:11:30.750,城门失火 殃及池鱼,00:11:28.080,00:11:31.480,"""When the city gate caught fire, water was drained
 from the pond, leaving the fish to suffer."""
00:11:32.880,00:11:34.550,我竟不知该怪谁了,00:11:33.780,00:11:35.680,I don’t even know who to blame now.
00:11:37.080,00:11:40.390,有心也好 无心也罢,00:11:37.940,00:11:41.260,No matter if it was intentional or not.
00:11:41.440,00:11:43.430,千错万错都是年妃的错,00:11:42.420,00:11:44.420,It is all Consort Nian’s fault.
00:11:44.960,00:11:46.590,事情既然已经发生了,00:11:45.780,00:11:47.500,"What has happened, has happened."
00:11:47.200,00:11:48.630,姐姐无谓再多想了,00:11:48.000,00:11:49.520,Don't let your thoughts dwell over it.
00:11:49.120,00:11:50.310,养好身子要紧哪,00:11:49.900,00:11:51.740,It is not good for restoring your health.
00:11:53.600,00:11:54.820,我看姐姐的伤痕,,,
00:11:55.360,00:11:56.710,也快好得差不多了,00:11:54.480,00:11:57.600,I see that your scar is almost invisible.
00:11:57.600,00:11:58.990,舒痕胶快用完了吧,00:11:58.420,00:12:00.160,How much Scar Relief Gel is left?
00:12:00.200,00:12:01.470,只剩一点点了,00:12:01.080,00:12:02.560,Just a little.
00:12:03.520,00:12:06.670,看来妹妹的舒痕胶的确有效,00:12:04.500,00:12:07.500,I'm glad the gel has been so helpful.
00:12:08.480,00:12:10.470,妹妹也不过是略尽绵力罢了,00:12:09.400,00:12:11.400,I'm just doing what I can.
00:12:11.960,00:12:13.270,姐姐只要笑一笑,00:12:12.920,00:12:14.460,"Whenever you smile,"
00:12:13.880,00:12:15.950,依旧是皇上最爱的如花容颜,00:12:14.780,00:12:17.300,you are still as beautiful as a flower in His Majesty's eyes.
00:12:18.120,00:12:20.420,我病中悲愁 只会落泪,00:12:18.940,00:12:21.540,All I can do with my sorrow is cry.
00:12:21.240,00:12:22.790,哪有什么如花容颜,00:12:22.160,00:12:24.120,I don't look like a flower.
00:12:24.600,00:12:27.470,后宫笑脸迎皇上之人如过江之螂,00:12:25.060,00:12:28.840,"People in the harem who greet His Majesty with a
smile are more numerous than carp in a river."
00:12:28.520,00:12:31.080,皇上自然不愿意登我这伤心门第,00:12:29.240,00:12:32.120,Of course His Majesty is unwilling to step through my gloomy doors.
00:12:32.000,00:12:33.310,妹妹信口胡说的,00:12:32.800,00:12:34.460,I spoke without thinking.
00:12:33.640,00:12:35.270,姐姐可千万别往心里去,00:12:34.460,00:12:36.340,Please don't take it to heart.
00:12:36.680,00:12:40.030,姐姐美貌 皇上又怎会忘怀呢,00:12:37.620,00:12:40.940,His Majesty will not forget your beautiful face.
00:12:40.520,00:12:41.950,看来难以忘怀的,00:12:41.380,00:12:43.480,It seems that only the beautiful face
00:12:43.320,00:12:44.630,也只有美貌而已,00:12:44.180,00:12:45.980,is what's unforgettable.
00:12:56.600,00:12:57.820,皇上一个多月,,,
00:12:58.240,00:12:59.790,一个人都没召幸过,00:12:57.440,00:13:00.620,His Majesty hasn't visited any concubines for the past month?
00:13:00.120,00:13:00.870,是,00:13:00.760,00:13:01.700,Correct.
00:13:01.160,00:13:02.630,除了十五那天晚上,,,
00:13:02.920,00:13:04.510,来陪皇后娘娘以外,00:13:01.800,00:13:05.460,"Except for visiting Your Majesty on the 15th,"
00:13:04.760,00:13:06.750,皇上一位小主都没见,00:13:05.680,00:13:07.560,His Majesty has not visited anyone else.
00:13:07.040,00:13:08.790,你每天都递牌子上去吗,00:13:07.720,00:13:09.740,Have you presented the name tags to His Majesty every night?
00:13:09.000,00:13:12.510,是 可是皇上连看都不看,00:13:09.840,00:13:13.400,"I have, but His Majesty hasn't even bothered to look."
00:13:14.080,00:13:16.350,皇上驾到,00:13:14.860,00:13:17.140,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:13:20.280,00:13:21.590,皇上万福金安,00:13:21.020,00:13:22.660,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:13:22.840,00:13:23.510,起来吧,00:13:23.400,00:13:24.520,Rise.
00:13:31.800,00:13:34.360,朕经过这里 进来看看,00:13:32.780,00:13:35.340,"I was passing by your palace, so I thought I should come in."
00:13:34.960,00:13:36.180,外头天气这么热,00:13:35.740,00:13:37.420,It's very hot outside.
00:13:36.600,00:13:37.710,仔细暑气重,00:13:37.420,00:13:39.240,I hope Your Majesty wasn't affected by the summer heat.
00:13:38.520,00:13:40.710,皇上喝碗红枣茶润润喉吧,00:13:39.420,00:13:41.860,Please have some red date tea to soothe your throat.
00:13:51.160,00:13:54.190,太甜 没茶味了,00:13:51.940,00:13:53.380,It's too sweet.
,,,00:13:54.240,00:13:55.500,It has lost the flavor of tea.
00:13:54.720,00:13:56.830,那臣妾叫人换杯莲子汤来,00:13:55.640,00:13:57.760,I'll ask them to serve lotus seed soup instead.
00:13:57.240,00:14:01.990,不必了 朕就是进来坐会儿,00:13:57.980,00:13:59.580,It's all right.
,,,00:14:00.180,00:14:02.960,My visit is only for a moment.
00:14:05.000,00:14:06.470,皇上你又瘦了,00:14:05.960,00:14:07.700,Your Majesty has slimmed down.
00:14:07.160,00:14:08.630,是否政务繁忙啊,00:14:08.060,00:14:09.880,Are the state affairs keeping Your Majesty occupied?
00:14:11.240,00:14:12.220,也还好吧,00:14:11.920,00:14:13.500,Not too bad.
00:14:14.040,00:14:15.430,皇上忙于朝政,,,
00:14:15.680,00:14:18.060,更要有贴心的人在身边侍奉着,00:14:14.920,00:14:18.540,"While Your Majesty is busy with the state affairs,
you must have someone thoughtful to serve you."
00:14:18.400,00:14:20.860,虽然定例三年选秀一次,00:14:19.240,00:14:21.900,A concubine selection is arranged every three years.
00:14:21.360,00:14:23.660,但宫中近日连遭变故,00:14:22.260,00:14:24.600,"With the consecutive misfortunes in the harem,"
00:14:24.200,00:14:26.630,皇上若觉得后宫没个可心人,00:14:25.220,00:14:28.120,"if Your Majesty feels there is no one to your liking,"
00:14:27.320,00:14:30.830,不如再选些新人入宫陪伴皇上啊,00:14:28.120,00:14:31.500,we can select some new concubines to serve Your Majesty.
00:14:31.920,00:14:33.790,莞嫔失了龙胎,00:14:32.620,00:14:35.100,"Concubine Sourire has just lost an imperial child,"
00:14:35.000,00:14:37.190,太后听了伤心卧病,00:14:35.760,00:14:38.220,and the Empress Dowager fell ill after hearing the news.
00:14:38.480,00:14:41.790,朕子嗣不保 孝道未尽,00:14:39.240,00:14:42.580,I lost my children and failed to fulfill my filial duty.
00:14:42.080,00:14:43.470,已是心力憔悴,00:14:42.860,00:14:44.620,I'm emotionally exhausted.
00:14:44.240,00:14:45.460,哪有心思选秀啊,00:14:45.060,00:14:46.720,How can I get in the frame of mind for a concubine selection?
00:14:46.000,00:14:49.190,臣妾只希望皇上心中愉悦,00:14:46.880,00:14:49.840,I was hoping only to bring contentment to Your Majesty.
00:14:50.280,00:14:51.630,朕心愉悦,00:14:51.140,00:14:52.880,My contentment
00:14:52.560,00:14:54.750,不是多几个女人伺候就是了,00:14:53.400,00:14:55.620,does not come from having more women to serve me.
00:14:55.920,00:14:59.150,这个女人不光要听话懂事,00:14:56.820,00:15:00.200,"A woman must not only be obedient and sensible,"
00:15:00.160,00:15:03.430,更要懂得朕 明白朕,00:15:00.840,00:15:04.120,but also know me and understand me.
00:15:05.440,00:15:06.580,但又别太懂,00:15:06.260,00:15:07.940,"But not understand me too well,"
00:15:07.400,00:15:10.070,懂那么一点能和朕说上话就是了,00:15:08.160,00:15:10.600,just enough to converse intelligently with me.
00:15:10.720,00:15:14.340,太懂或者是太不懂 朕都不喜欢,00:15:11.640,00:15:15.420,Knowing me too well or too little isn't to my liking.
00:15:15.240,00:15:16.300,臣妾明白,00:15:16.060,00:15:17.360,I understand.
00:15:17.040,00:15:17.910,明白就好,00:15:17.640,00:15:19.320,It's good that you understand.
00:15:19.480,00:15:21.910,朕还有事先走了,00:15:20.340,00:15:23.440,I still have things to attend to. I'll leave now.
00:15:26.120,00:15:28.390,皇上起驾,00:15:26.880,00:15:29.380,His Majesty departs.
00:15:31.560,00:15:34.270,娘娘 您何苦提选秀的事呢,00:15:32.500,00:15:35.120,"Your Majesty, why bother bringing up a concubine selection?"
00:15:34.560,00:15:35.700,后宫本不缺人,00:15:35.440,00:15:37.080,The harem never lacks concubines.
00:15:36.560,00:15:37.990,倒让皇上不高兴了,00:15:37.240,00:15:39.060,That made His Majesty unhappy.
00:15:39.440,00:15:41.790,哪有男人不喜欢新鲜的,00:15:40.340,00:15:42.920,I've never seen a man who doesn't like fresh faces.
00:15:42.720,00:15:44.990,皇上这个位置就更是了,00:15:43.680,00:15:45.960,This is even more true for an emperor.
00:15:46.280,00:15:49.150,皇上不召人侍寝 不选秀,00:15:47.180,00:15:50.300,"His Majesty isn't interested in the concubines
and won't select any new ones"
00:15:49.920,00:15:52.070,是因为对莞嫔失子的事,,,
00:15:52.320,00:15:53.380,还没有放下,00:15:50.800,00:15:54.200,because he hasn't gotten over the loss of Concubine Sourire's child.
00:15:54.080,00:15:54.670,也是,,,
00:15:55.440,00:15:56.750,富察贵人失子的时候,00:15:54.860,00:15:56.020,That is true.
00:15:57.120,00:15:58.340,也没见皇上这般难受,00:15:56.020,00:15:59.320,His Majesty was never this woeful when Lady Fuca lost her child.
00:15:58.880,00:16:01.310,可是近日也没见皇上多去看莞嫔,00:15:59.580,00:16:02.180,But His Majesty hasn't been visiting Concubine Sourire either.
00:16:01.920,00:16:04.550,你长着眼睛 心却不透啊,00:16:02.700,00:16:05.500,"Your eyes see, but your heart is not perceptive."
00:16:05.600,00:16:08.230,有句话叫近乡情更怯,00:16:06.500,00:16:09.400,"""The closer to home you get, the more insecure you become."""
00:16:08.720,00:16:11.550,皇上越是这样越是放不下,00:16:09.680,00:16:13.420,"His Majesty acts like this because
he hasn't gotten over his feelings."
00:16:12.880,00:16:15.950,皇上刚才说不喜欢旁人懂太多,00:16:13.580,00:16:16.900,"His Majesty said he doesn't like a woman
to understand too much about him."
00:16:16.480,00:16:18.590,本宫懂得也太多了,00:16:17.060,00:16:19.460,I'm afraid I understand him too much.
00:16:20.280,00:16:22.950,对了 太医去看过安常在了吗,00:16:21.240,00:16:23.800,"By the way, has the doctor checked on Attendant An?"
00:16:23.240,00:16:25.540,太医说安常在的嗓子没什么大碍,00:16:24.000,00:16:26.440,"Yes, the doctor said Attendant An's throat is close to full recovery."
00:16:26.160,00:16:26.990,那就好,00:16:26.840,00:16:27.940,That's good.
00:16:27.200,00:16:28.990,乐师那边有没有好好教她,00:16:27.960,00:16:29.820,Has the music instructor been teaching her?
00:16:29.360,00:16:30.580,安常在学得仔细,00:16:30.080,00:16:31.760,"Yes, Attendant An has been studying attentively."
00:16:30.880,00:16:32.510,乐师也说她极具天赋,00:16:31.760,00:16:33.640,Her instructor also said she is very talented.
00:16:34.720,00:16:37.390,本宫要好好调教调教她的嗓音,00:16:35.560,00:16:38.340,Her voice needs more training.
00:16:37.880,00:16:39.270,别浪费了呀,00:16:38.700,00:16:40.340,It will be useful.
00:16:44.000,00:16:47.150,躺了一个多月 人都躺瘦了,00:16:44.540,00:16:48.540,I lost weight after being bedridden for a month.
00:16:48.240,00:16:49.270,小主还年轻,,,
00:16:49.560,00:16:50.700,有什么补不回来的,00:16:48.980,00:16:51.820,"My Lady, you're still young.
You will make up for it."
00:16:51.640,00:16:54.230,皇上驾到,00:16:52.380,00:16:55.020,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:17:03.160,00:17:04.510,皇上万福金安,00:17:04.080,00:17:05.780,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:17:06.160,00:17:06.950,快坐着吧,,,
00:17:07.400,00:17:08.230,谢皇上,00:17:06.840,00:17:08.120,Have a seat.
,,,00:17:08.120,00:17:09.680,I thank Your Majesty.
00:17:21.040,00:17:22.710,你的气色还是不大好,00:17:21.880,00:17:23.560,You still look unwell.
00:17:24.560,00:17:27.270,上回苏培盛送来的血燕都吃了吗,00:17:24.860,00:17:27.580,Have you consumed the red bird's nest Su Peisheng sent?
00:17:27.920,00:17:28.670,都用了,00:17:28.600,00:17:29.620,I have.
00:17:29.520,00:17:31.350,只是调养是日久的功夫,00:17:30.300,00:17:32.580,But nursing and nourishment take time.
00:17:32.200,00:17:33.470,未必这么快就见效,00:17:32.940,00:17:35.180,The bird's nest doesn't take effect very quickly.
00:17:38.120,00:17:42.070,朕看你脖子上的伤疤都没有了,00:17:38.900,00:17:42.860,I notice that the scar on your neck has disappeared.
00:17:44.560,00:17:45.870,还好没有伤到脸,00:17:45.540,00:17:47.300,It's fortunate that it wasn't on your face.
00:17:47.400,00:17:49.070,若真是留下个疤痕,00:17:48.160,00:17:49.840,What a shame it would be
00:17:49.920,00:17:51.390,真是白璧微瑕了,00:17:50.680,00:17:52.640,"to have ""a slight blemish in pure jade""."
00:17:54.240,00:17:56.390,皇上真是爱惜臣妾的容貌,00:17:54.980,00:17:57.260,Your Majesty dearly cherishes my face.
00:17:57.040,00:17:58.790,嬛嬛美貌岂可辜负,00:17:57.840,00:18:00.000,"Huan Huan, your beauty deserves to be appreciated."
00:17:59.600,00:18:01.630,原来皇上这样在意臣妾的容貌,00:18:00.240,00:18:03.200,I never knew Your Majesty cares so much about my appearance.
00:18:18.160,00:18:21.750,莞嫔 你性子太倔强,00:18:18.800,00:18:22.420,"Concubine Sourire, you're being stubborn."
00:18:24.000,00:18:27.230,朕念你失子不久 不和你计较,00:18:24.800,00:18:28.040,I forgive you considering your recent loss.
00:18:32.440,00:18:34.070,你自己好好静一静吧,00:18:33.120,00:18:35.300,Take some time to restore yourself.
00:18:40.400,00:18:41.540,恭送皇上,00:18:41.120,00:18:42.960,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:18:50.720,00:18:51.510,贵人吉祥,00:18:51.480,00:18:52.980,Peace to Lady Vertu.
00:18:52.160,00:18:54.720,微臣给惠贵人请平安脉,00:18:52.980,00:18:55.500,I'm here for the routine pulse-taking.
00:19:01.320,00:19:03.230,贵人瞧什么瞧得这么入神,00:19:02.100,00:19:04.120,"My Lady, what are you looking at?"
00:19:03.480,00:19:06.150,你看 都入了七月了,00:19:04.340,00:19:06.520,"Look, it's July already"
00:19:06.720,00:19:09.070,石榴花开得还是那样的好,00:19:07.460,00:19:10.300,but the pomegranate is still blooming
00:19:10.000,00:19:12.630,好像永远也开不完似的,00:19:11.020,00:19:13.560,as if its flowers will bloom endlessly.
00:19:13.960,00:19:15.270,莞嫔小主来过这里吗,00:19:14.660,00:19:16.440,Has Concubine Sourire come here recently?
00:19:16.160,00:19:16.950,若是她来,,,
00:19:17.440,00:19:19.390,还请小主不要让她看到这些花,00:19:17.060,00:19:20.200,"If she comes, I hope you can put away the flowers, My Lady."
00:19:20.200,00:19:21.470,以免触景生情,00:19:21.040,00:19:22.520,They would make her sentimental.
00:19:22.000,00:19:24.910,宫外的石榴花若受风雨摧残,00:19:22.640,00:19:26.200,"Sir, if you see the flowers outside the palace
being harmed by the wind and the rain,"
00:19:25.280,00:19:27.470,大人尽可做个惜花之人,00:19:26.420,00:19:28.840,you can be the one to protect them.
00:19:28.520,00:19:30.630,但是宫内的一花一木,00:19:29.420,00:19:31.540,But every single flower inside the palace
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.270,哪怕一片残叶,00:19:31.700,00:19:33.240,"or even a fallen leaf,"
00:19:32.560,00:19:34.270,都只属皇上所有,00:19:33.340,00:19:35.220,belongs only to His Majesty.
00:19:35.040,00:19:36.990,大人惜花之情再盛,00:19:35.740,00:19:37.880,"However much you long to protect them,"
00:19:37.760,00:19:40.270,也只能远观而不可近护,00:19:38.540,00:19:41.060,you can only guard them distantly.
00:19:41.520,00:19:43.750,贵人之言 微臣明白,00:19:42.420,00:19:44.660,"I understand, My Lady."
00:19:44.800,00:19:46.150,微臣自知无福做一个,,,
00:19:46.400,00:19:47.590,惜花护花之人,00:19:45.660,00:19:48.360,"I know I don't have the blessing
to be the protector of the flower."
00:19:48.360,00:19:50.070,只希望远远地看着这些花,,,
00:19:50.360,00:19:51.190,开而不败,00:19:49.220,00:19:51.660,My only wish is to see these flowers never fading.
00:19:51.880,00:19:52.910,也算心安了,00:19:52.600,00:19:54.220,So my mind will be at peace.
00:19:53.840,00:19:55.030,人心贪婪,00:19:54.580,00:19:56.160,Greedy is the human mind
00:19:55.520,00:19:58.270,总是进了一步 还想再进一步,00:19:56.320,00:19:59.380,which hopes to get closer one step after another.
00:19:59.080,00:20:00.910,若是懂得适可而止,00:19:59.760,00:20:01.820,Stop where you should
00:20:01.600,00:20:03.790,才能存长久之道啊,00:20:02.200,00:20:04.400,and that will go a long way.
00:20:04.160,00:20:07.030,贵人金玉良言 微臣谨记,00:20:04.860,00:20:07.620,"I will obey your golden advice, My Lady."
00:20:09.360,00:20:10.070,宝鹃,00:20:09.840,00:20:11.120,"Coua,"
00:20:11.000,00:20:13.510,我刚才那样唱可还好听,00:20:11.660,00:20:14.180,How do you like my singing?
00:20:14.720,00:20:16.270,奴婢说不出有多好,00:20:15.480,00:20:17.360,I can't describe how beautiful it is.
00:20:16.680,00:20:18.710,总之比之前唱得好多了,00:20:17.460,00:20:19.700,But I think it has improved a lot from before.
00:20:20.600,00:20:21.350,那就好,00:20:21.320,00:20:22.680,That's good.
00:20:24.200,00:20:25.510,小主 皇上,00:20:24.880,00:20:26.800,My Lady. His Majesty is there!
00:20:26.520,00:20:28.430,小主 快去给皇上请安吧,00:20:27.360,00:20:29.800,"My Lady, shall we go greet His Majesty?"
00:20:30.280,00:20:32.110,皇上好像不太高兴的样子,00:20:31.160,00:20:33.160,His Majesty looks unhappy.
00:20:32.760,00:20:35.550,皇上好像从碎玉轩出来的,00:20:33.340,00:20:36.140,It seems His Majesty is coming from the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:20:36.640,00:20:37.590,奴婢听说,,,
00:20:38.400,00:20:40.310,莞嫔娘娘没了孩子之后,,,
00:20:40.800,00:20:43.100,伤心过度 言语无状,00:20:37.420,00:20:43.920,"I heard that Concubine Sourire has been
sad and disrespectful after her loss."
00:20:43.840,00:20:45.550,经常惹得皇上不高兴呢,00:20:44.660,00:20:47.000,Her Highness repeatedly made His Majesty upset.
00:20:48.280,00:20:50.740,姐姐再不好 她也是莞嫔,00:20:48.880,00:20:51.660,"No matter what she did, she is Concubine Sourire."
00:20:52.040,00:20:55.510,她得到的富贵恩宠别人怎么能比,00:20:52.920,00:20:56.220,How can anyone compare with her favor?
00:20:56.560,00:20:59.020,皇上只是以为小主你咳疾未愈,00:20:57.020,00:20:59.780,His Majesty thinks you're still recovering from your cough.
00:20:59.320,00:21:00.350,才没有来看你,00:21:00.040,00:21:01.660,That's why he hasn't visited.
00:21:01.360,00:21:02.790,也不只是小主你呀,00:21:02.080,00:21:04.020,"But not only you, My Lady."
00:21:03.360,00:21:05.660,皇上最近哪位小主那儿都没去,00:21:04.200,00:21:06.920,His Majesty hasn't visited anyone else lately.
00:21:07.520,00:21:09.470,见与不见都不要紧,00:21:08.320,00:21:10.880,It doesn't matter whether His Majesty visits me or not.
00:21:11.040,00:21:11.790,我只知道,,,
00:21:12.520,00:21:13.870,姐姐自从没了孩子,00:21:11.840,00:21:13.300,The only thing I know is
00:21:14.680,00:21:15.900,已经大不如从前,00:21:13.400,00:21:16.880,that Sourire isn't anywhere near where she was before her loss.
00:21:16.680,00:21:18.070,就连年妃也失了宠,00:21:17.520,00:21:19.420,Even Consort Nian has fallen from favor.
00:21:19.840,00:21:20.820,皇上身边,,,
00:21:21.520,00:21:23.470,现在连个可心的人都没有,00:21:20.700,00:21:23.860,"Now, His Majesty does not even have one concubine to his liking."
00:21:23.720,00:21:26.150,没有才好呢 多清净啊,00:21:24.420,00:21:26.860,Isn't that a good thing for the palace?
00:21:27.560,00:21:28.510,现在没有,00:21:28.260,00:21:29.620,"Now he doesn't,"
00:21:29.360,00:21:30.830,并不代表以后也没有,00:21:30.040,00:21:31.500,but one day he will.
00:21:32.080,00:21:33.220,以后若是有,00:21:32.780,00:21:34.320,"When the day comes,"
00:21:34.360,00:21:36.350,我希望那个人是我就好了,00:21:34.960,00:21:36.960,I hope that concubine is me.
00:21:37.200,00:21:38.260,那是自然的,,,
00:21:38.640,00:21:39.620,宫里的风光,00:21:37.860,00:21:39.220,That's for sure.
00:21:40.000,00:21:42.430,也不能只在翊坤宫和碎玉轩吧,00:21:39.300,00:21:43.260,"The honor and favor in the palace can't always reside in
the Palace of Earthy Honor and the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:21:42.800,00:21:44.470,也该轮到咱们延禧宫了,00:21:43.600,00:21:45.580,It will turn to the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.

00:22:20.680,00:22:22.110,皇上祭天之后,,,
00:22:22.360,00:22:23.950,上天雨露甘霖不断,00:22:21.520,00:22:23.460,"Since Your Majesty's trip to the Temple of Heaven,"
00:22:24.320,00:22:25.750,大旱早已缓解,00:22:23.520,00:22:26.200,it has rained continuously and relieved the drought.
00:22:26.440,00:22:30.110,看来是皇上的诚意感动上苍了,00:22:27.360,00:22:30.800,Heaven is moved by Your Majesty's devotion.
00:22:33.760,00:22:36.110,皇上圣心垂怜苍生,00:22:34.600,00:22:36.540,Your Majesty has compassion for all the lives under Heaven
00:22:36.400,00:22:38.670,皇后也体贴姐妹们心意,00:22:36.820,00:22:39.240,and Her Majesty cares for all of us concubines.
00:22:39.000,00:22:40.710,我们才能在这太液池,,,
00:22:41.000,00:22:42.270,观赏这映日荷花,00:22:39.620,00:22:43.140,That is why we are so fortunate to admire the lotus here by Taiye Lake
00:22:43.080,00:22:44.950,臣妾感激不尽,00:22:43.920,00:22:45.920,I am so grateful to Your Majesty.
00:22:45.720,00:22:46.860,本宫虽有意,,,
00:22:47.200,00:22:48.510,也要皇上准许才行,00:22:46.600,00:22:49.060,My proposal was approved by His Majesty.
00:22:49.200,00:22:52.310,要谢本宫 倒不如谢皇上呢,00:22:49.920,00:22:53.160,You should thank His Majesty instead.
00:22:53.800,00:22:55.550,臣妾谢皇上,00:22:54.400,00:22:56.600,I thank Your Majesty.
00:23:06.440,00:23:07.230,皇上,00:23:07.100,00:23:08.360,Your Majesty.
00:23:08.080,00:23:10.310,皇上喝了富察贵人的酒,00:23:08.940,00:23:11.120,Your Majesty accepted Lady Fuca's toast.
00:23:10.520,00:23:12.670,也赏脸喝了臣妾的酒吧,00:23:11.240,00:23:13.500,Please do not refuse mine.
00:23:20.240,00:23:21.110,谢皇上,00:23:21.120,00:23:22.700,I thank Your Majesty.
00:23:41.560,00:23:43.830,皇上 请再喝一杯吧,00:23:42.380,00:23:44.660,"Your Majesty, please have another drink."
00:23:45.440,00:23:48.750,朕实在不能了 歇会儿再喝,00:23:46.280,00:23:49.600,I wish I could. I need a break.
00:23:49.040,00:23:50.590,这便是皇上偏心了,00:23:49.860,00:23:51.400,Your Majesty is partial to Lady Fuca.
00:23:51.440,00:23:53.150,您都喝了富察贵人的酒,,,
00:23:53.480,00:23:54.870,却不喝臣妾的,00:23:52.180,00:23:55.240,"You accepted Lady Fuca's toast, but not mine."
00:23:55.160,00:23:56.030,不是朕偏心,00:23:55.840,00:23:57.300,I'm not partial to anyone.
00:23:57.040,00:23:59.390,富察贵人失子以后,,,
00:23:59.680,00:24:00.950,很久都没有见朕了,00:23:58.000,00:24:01.480,Lady Fuca has not seen me since her miscarriage.
00:24:01.880,00:24:03.670,如今她心结纤解,,,
00:24:03.920,00:24:04.950,朕也替她高兴,00:24:02.800,00:24:05.900,I am happy for her seeing that she's overcome her grief.
00:24:05.600,00:24:07.830,这个酒朕是不能不喝,00:24:06.440,00:24:08.580,So I drank with her.
00:24:11.720,00:24:14.590,皇上这话像是说给你听的,00:24:12.620,00:24:15.700,It sounds like His Majesty was saying that to you.
00:24:15.680,00:24:18.910,年妃的事皇上也是无可奈何,00:24:16.400,00:24:19.580,His Majesty was in a quandary about Consort Nian.
00:24:19.800,00:24:22.630,妹妹还是要体谅皇上的难处啊,00:24:20.540,00:24:23.620,"You have to understand him, Sourire."
00:24:24.360,00:24:26.110,我失去的是我自己的孩子,00:24:25.100,00:24:27.420,It was my own child that I lost.
00:24:27.600,00:24:30.670,所以即便明白 也不能不怨,00:24:28.380,00:24:31.640,I cannot forgive even if I understand him.
00:24:35.480,00:24:36.230,还没到吗,,,
00:24:36.720,00:24:37.750,就快到了 娘娘,00:24:36.320,00:24:37.440,Are we there yet?
00:24:38.360,00:24:39.230,合宫宴饮,00:24:37.520,00:24:38.860,"Almost, Your Highness."
00:24:39.760,00:24:41.350,竟然这个时候才知会本宫,00:24:39.020,00:24:42.300,"If everyone is attending, how could they inform me so late?"
00:24:42.920,00:24:44.830,也不知道皇上愿不愿意见本宫,00:24:43.460,00:24:45.860,Will His Majesty want to see me?
00:24:46.080,00:24:48.310,听说皇上为了普降甘霖之事,00:24:46.940,00:24:49.860,"I heard that His Majesty is very happy
about the alleviation of drought."
00:24:48.600,00:24:49.310,十分高兴,,,
00:24:49.760,00:24:50.740,今日合宫皆在,,,
00:24:51.040,00:24:52.470,皇上不会让娘娘没脸,00:24:50.580,00:24:51.860,"Since everyone is attending,"
00:24:52.760,00:24:53.740,定会见娘娘的,00:24:51.860,00:24:54.560,His Majesty will not embarrass Your Highness.
00:24:56.320,00:24:59.270,皇上上回说不愿劳师动众选秀,00:24:57.140,00:25:00.280,Your Majesty did not want to hold another Selection
00:25:00.600,00:25:02.470,臣妾便在宫女里面,,,
00:25:02.760,00:25:04.630,选了几个姿色清丽的,00:25:01.480,00:25:05.080,so I selected some from inside the palace.
00:25:05.160,00:25:07.910,皇上看看有否可意之人选,00:25:05.980,00:25:08.740,Is Your Majesty interested in meeting them?
00:25:08.480,00:25:10.150,朕明白皇后大度,00:25:09.320,00:25:11.220,It is a generous gesture
00:25:11.040,00:25:12.260,可朕没有这个心情,00:25:11.960,00:25:13.860,but I am not in the mood to do so.
00:25:19.440,00:25:22.870,新人虽好 佳人难再得,00:25:20.340,00:25:23.960,"It's good to gain a new, but hard to have a beloved."
00:25:24.360,00:25:25.950,内廷排了一个新曲,00:25:25.120,00:25:26.860,The Music House rehearsed a new song.
00:25:26.480,00:25:27.700,还请皇上一观,00:25:27.100,00:25:29.040,They wish to present it to Your Majesty.
00:25:29.520,00:25:32.870,今日饮酒过多 改日再看吧,00:25:30.460,00:25:33.760,I drank too much today. I will see it another day.
00:25:34.440,00:25:35.870,歌女训练许久了,00:25:35.200,00:25:36.940,They've spent a long time training
00:25:36.320,00:25:38.990,也只希望能为皇上助兴啊,00:25:37.060,00:25:39.820,simply hoping to entertain Your Majesty.
00:25:40.880,00:25:41.630,也好吧,00:25:41.720,00:25:43.120,"Fine, then."
00:25:43.840,00:25:44.510,剪秋,00:25:44.560,00:25:45.720,Autumn.
00:25:45.440,00:25:46.350,是 娘娘,00:25:46.340,00:25:47.640,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:26:05.800,00:26:07.190,年妃娘娘吉祥,00:26:06.160,00:26:07.900,Peace to Consort Nian.
00:26:07.640,00:26:08.350,起来吧,00:26:08.360,00:26:09.560,Rise
00:26:10.840,00:26:11.820,娘娘等一下,,,
00:26:12.280,00:26:13.470,琼华岛在湖心,00:26:11.460,00:26:12.940,Your Highness will need to wait for a while.
00:26:13.800,00:26:15.110,应该会有船接送的,00:26:13.020,00:26:16.280,"There will be a boat to take
Your Highness to the Jade Light Island."
00:26:17.000,00:26:19.910,娘娘奉旨去琼华岛 船在哪里,00:26:17.940,00:26:20.680,"Her Highness is going to
the Jade Light Island by His Majesty's order."
00:26:20.160,00:26:22.510,嫔女己们都去琼华岛了,00:26:20.980,00:26:23.260,All the concubines have traveled to the island.
00:26:22.920,00:26:25.190,船在那边一时过不来,00:26:23.540,00:26:26.040,They will not be able to send their boats back for now.
00:26:27.080,00:26:28.790,那往来宫人们的船总有吧,00:26:27.940,00:26:29.860,What about the boats for servants?
00:26:29.240,00:26:31.110,皇后娘娘事先有盼咐,,,
00:26:31.400,00:26:33.960,说今儿个的船都有用处,00:26:30.020,00:26:34.580,"The Empress informed us that all the other boats
have been reserved for a special purpose."
00:26:34.600,00:26:37.310,所以说湖面上一例启开了,,,
00:26:37.720,00:26:38.750,不让停船,00:26:35.520,00:26:39.920,That is why the lake is clear of boats at the moment.
00:26:43.320,00:26:44.110,谁在唱歌,00:26:42.020,00:26:44.040,(Lotuses are harvested south of River Yangtze)

00:27:04.320,00:27:05.710,衣裳倒搭得好,00:27:05.060,00:27:07.160,I like the colors in her outfit.

00:27:11.960,00:27:13.550,是费了一番心思,00:27:12.180,00:27:14.080,They did put some thought into it.
00:27:13.960,00:27:17.740,衣裳再美 终究不及歌声啊,00:27:14.260,00:27:19.400,"The clothes are not as beautiful as her voice.

(Who’s the girl deep in the lotus leaves?)"
00:27:24.760,00:27:27.590,是长得太丑不能见人吗,00:27:25.520,00:27:28.460,"Is she too ugly to reveal it?
(Who’s the girl deep in the lotus leaves?)"

(She tossed a flower pod and smiled)"
00:27:36.240,00:27:38.670,一听到她的歌声我都酥了,00:27:36.320,00:27:39.600,"Even I feel soothed by her voice.

00:27:39.680,00:27:41.070,更别说是皇上了,00:27:40.480,00:27:42.400,Let alone His Majesty.
00:27:46.440,00:27:48.190,歌喉虽然还有所不及,00:27:47.360,00:27:49.220,"Her singing isn't as good,"
00:27:48.720,00:27:51.350,可是已经有六七分像了,00:27:49.560,00:27:51.800,but it bears a remarkable resemblance ...
00:27:51.600,00:27:53.470,这已经＋分难能可贵了,00:27:52.380,00:27:54.040,That is remarkable.

00:28:10.720,00:28:13.070,但却比陵容的声音更清澈婉转,00:28:11.360,00:28:14.140,"But clearer and more skilled.

00:28:40.840,00:28:53.640,隔水笑抛一枝莲,00:28:42.220,00:28:53.200,(She tossed a flower pod and smiled.)
00:28:57.400,00:28:58.110,姑娘,00:28:58.200,00:28:59.380,"Miss,"
00:28:58.920,00:29:01.990,您的歌若是唱完了请立即上来,00:28:59.580,00:29:02.760,"please come up here if the song is over,"
00:29:02.680,00:29:03.790,皇上传召呢,00:29:03.520,00:29:05.180,at His Majesty's behest.
00:29:16.160,00:29:19.830,美人若如斯 何不早入怀,00:29:16.960,00:29:20.660,"""Had I known beauty as such,
nothing else would I have touched."""
00:29:33.600,00:29:35.900,皇上 可知道她是谁吗,00:29:34.500,00:29:37.060,Does Your Majesty know who she is?
00:29:39.920,00:29:42.150,快 给皇上看看你的真容,00:29:40.880,00:29:43.520,Reveal your face to His Majesty.
00:29:51.480,00:29:53.990,臣妾安陵容参见皇上,00:29:52.500,00:29:55.480,An Lingrong bows in respect before Your Majesty.
00:29:57.240,00:29:58.790,你不是患了咳疾吗,00:29:58.160,00:29:59.980,I thought you had a cough?
00:29:59.400,00:30:00.910,皇后派人悉心照顾,00:30:00.380,00:30:01.860,Her Majesty has been taking good care of me.
00:30:01.240,00:30:02.190,早已经好了,00:30:02.120,00:30:03.440,I have recovered.
00:30:03.920,00:30:06.550,不仅好了 还更胜从前,00:30:04.800,00:30:08.320,Not just recovered. You sing even better than before.
00:30:10.440,00:30:12.230,皇后费尽苦心,00:30:11.380,00:30:13.480,You put a lot of thought into this.
00:30:12.880,00:30:16.550,朕有你是朕的福气,00:30:13.780,00:30:17.180,I'm blessed to have you as my Empress.
00:30:19.520,00:30:21.670,臣妾见皇上终日苦闷,00:30:20.440,00:30:22.600,I saw Your Majesty was absorbed in grief
00:30:22.120,00:30:24.070,所以才出此下策的,00:30:23.020,00:30:24.960,so I made this rash decision.
00:30:24.320,00:30:26.270,希望皇上能够日日舒心,,,
00:30:26.560,00:30:27.590,福寿安康,00:30:25.160,00:30:27.980,I hope this will bring Your Majesty joy and good health.
00:30:27.760,00:30:28.390,留神,00:30:28.580,00:30:29.880,Mind your step.
00:30:35.280,00:30:36.710,我从没有见过,00:30:36.100,00:30:37.620,I've never seen Her Majesty
00:30:37.000,00:30:39.510,皇后对皇上如此深情,00:30:37.760,00:30:40.360,being so devoted to His Majesty
00:30:40.640,00:30:44.030,竟能将他人拱手奉于皇上怀中,00:30:41.540,00:30:45.020,that she sends him another woman with open arms.
00:30:45.440,00:30:47.430,只求他能高兴便可,00:30:46.180,00:30:48.320,Just to make him happy.
00:30:48.920,00:30:54.150,爱人之心当真能宽宏大度至此吗,00:30:49.720,00:30:54.800,Is a loving heart as unselfish as this?
00:30:55.960,00:30:57.150,容儿的常在,,,
00:30:57.680,00:30:59.510,还是去年此时封的,00:30:56.880,00:31:00.300,"Lingrong was promoted to Attendant
around this time last year."
00:31:00.840,00:31:03.400,如今就晋为贵人吧,00:31:01.680,00:31:04.240,"Now, I will promote you to Noble Lady."
00:31:05.520,00:31:07.390,臣妾多谢皇上厚爱,00:31:06.320,00:31:08.680,I thank Your Majesty for your gracious favor.
00:31:11.320,00:31:13.070,皇上 年妃娘娘求见,00:31:12.160,00:31:14.700,"Your Majesty, Consort Nian requests an audience."
00:31:15.520,00:31:17.390,往来的船只已经启开了,00:31:16.420,00:31:18.300,The boats have been cleared from the lake.
00:31:17.600,00:31:19.030,皇上是否另派小船,,,
00:31:19.400,00:31:20.430,去接年妃过来呀,00:31:18.580,00:31:20.920,Will Your Majesty send another boat to Consort Nian?
00:31:20.680,00:31:23.030,不必了 就叫她回去吧,00:31:21.080,00:31:23.720,That's not necessary. Tell her to return.
00:31:23.320,00:31:23.910,嗻,00:31:24.140,00:31:25.240,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:31:45.040,00:31:48.150,容儿一向是娇羞温柔,00:31:45.980,00:31:49.100,Lingrong has a sweet nature.
00:31:49.080,00:31:50.110,今日再见,,,
00:31:50.440,00:31:53.190,还是和新人的时候并无半分差别,00:31:50.040,00:31:53.880,"Just the same as when you were
a new concubine in the palace."
00:31:53.960,00:31:55.710,臣妾怎么能跟新人相比,00:31:54.800,00:31:56.560,I can't compare to a new concubine.
00:31:56.280,00:31:57.750,不过是旧酒装新壶,00:31:56.940,00:31:58.700,"I'm now ""old wine in a new bottle""."
00:31:58.280,00:32:00.390,皇上不厌弃臣妾愚钝罢了,00:31:58.780,00:32:01.460,Your Majesty says so because you appreciate my simple nature.
00:32:00.720,00:32:01.990,有爱卿在此,,,
00:32:02.240,00:32:04.470,自然是酒不醉人人自醉,00:32:01.540,00:32:04.840,Seeing you today is more inebriating than the wine.
00:32:05.800,00:32:10.350,今日重入朕怀 当长歌以贺,00:32:07.120,00:32:11.060,"Now that you have returned, you must sing
another song to honor your talent."
00:32:11.240,00:32:12.990,那臣妾就献丑了,00:32:12.120,00:32:14.520,Only if Your Majesty can bear with my singing.
00:32:15.920,00:32:23.550,劝君莫惜金缕衣,00:32:16.820,00:32:23.560,"Cherish not your gold-woven robe, in truth."
00:32:23.760,00:32:31.390,劝君惜取少年时,00:32:24.480,00:32:31.840,Cherish but your golden days of youth.
00:32:31.840,00:32:39.990,花开堪折直须折,00:32:32.800,00:32:40.000,"Cull the flower in its full bloom,"
00:32:40.240,00:32:48.270,莫待无花空折枝,00:32:41.240,00:32:48.260,not the empty branch you’d carry with gloom.
00:32:50.320,00:32:54.870,好一个有花堪折直须折,00:32:51.300,00:32:55.540,"""Cull the flower in its full bloom."""
00:32:55.320,00:32:57.230,朕便折你在手,,,
00:32:57.840,00:33:00.300,不会再让你枝头空寂寞,00:32:56.080,00:33:00.960,"I’ll have you as my blooming flower;
you won't feel lonely anymore."
00:33:01.760,00:33:04.220,取金缕衣来 赐安贵人,00:33:02.640,00:33:05.160,Bring the gold-woven robe and reward it to Lady An.
00:33:04.800,00:33:05.390,嗻,,,
00:33:05.600,00:33:06.470,金缕衣,00:33:05.740,00:33:06.300,Yes.
,,,00:33:06.440,00:33:07.620,The gold-woven robe?
00:33:06.880,00:33:09.710,金缕衣是先帝特意为舒妃所制的,00:33:07.700,00:33:10.540,The prior emperor made the gold-woven robe for his Consort Serein.
00:33:10.360,00:33:11.790,世上只得两件,00:33:11.220,00:33:12.900,Only two of them exist in the world.
00:33:12.320,00:33:14.070,一件遗留在宫中,00:33:13.140,00:33:14.820,"One is in the palace,"
00:33:14.720,00:33:17.550,另一件舒妃出宫时带走了,00:33:15.540,00:33:18.380,and the other was taken away by Consort Serein.
00:33:18.600,00:33:20.630,越女新妆出镜心,00:33:19.380,00:33:21.920,"It is like the poem: ""The Lady arose from the lake,
beautifully adorned, as if the lake were her mirror."""
00:33:21.160,00:33:24.510,安妹妹果然是一曲菱歌敌万金哪,00:33:21.960,00:33:25.400,"""Her song of the water lilies
is worth ten thousand gold taels."""
00:33:27.240,00:33:28.070,在想什么,00:33:27.900,00:33:29.640,What's on your mind?
00:33:29.720,00:33:31.590,这首歌陵容去年也唱过,00:33:30.500,00:33:33.140,Lingrong sang this song last year in the Summer Palace
00:33:32.600,00:33:35.910,凭此一曲她成了皇上的宠妃,00:33:33.380,00:33:36.700,and gained favor from His Majesty.
00:33:38.400,00:33:40.270,去年她唱得羞涩紧张,00:33:39.200,00:33:41.620,"Last year, her singing was shy and nervous."
00:33:41.000,00:33:44.070,远不如今日从容悠逸,00:33:41.860,00:33:46.500,"But today, it's leisurely and confident."
00:33:44.600,00:33:45.710,轻歌曼声,,,
00:33:48.800,00:33:53.190,也好 陵容总算是扬眉吐气了,00:33:49.640,00:33:54.040,"That is just as well.
Lingrong has regained His Majesty’s favor."
00:34:11.880,00:34:13.430,年妃娘娘吉祥,00:34:12.680,00:34:14.500,Peace to Consort Nian.
00:34:14.040,00:34:14.990,怎么是你来了,00:34:14.860,00:34:16.280,Why are you here?
00:34:16.840,00:34:18.470,先扶本宫上船再说吧,00:34:17.580,00:34:19.220,You may talk to me on the boat.
00:34:19.360,00:34:22.030,娘娘 这船不是给您用的,00:34:20.160,00:34:22.640,"Your Highness, the boat is not for you."
00:34:22.560,00:34:24.630,是皇上让奴才来传口谕,00:34:23.500,00:34:25.580,I’m here to deliver His Majesty’s order.
00:34:25.160,00:34:27.540,天气暑热 娘娘不宜走动,00:34:26.060,00:34:28.440,"It is inconvenient for Your Highness
to travel in the summer heat."
00:34:27.880,00:34:29.390,还请娘娘回宫吧,00:34:28.700,00:34:30.580,Your Highness should return to your palace.
00:34:30.760,00:34:32.230,你说口谕便是口谕了,00:34:31.500,00:34:33.660,You say that it is His Majesty’s order.
00:34:33.040,00:34:34.430,等本宫见了皇上再说,00:34:33.760,00:34:35.600,I will go see His Majesty myself.
00:34:35.280,00:34:38.900,娘娘 奴才怎敢假传皇上口谕呢,00:34:36.080,00:34:39.520,"Your Highness, why would I dare to deliver a false order?"
00:34:39.320,00:34:42.390,皇上不想见您也不是一日两日了,00:34:40.140,00:34:43.220,His Majesty hasn't wanted to see you for more than just a day or two.
00:34:42.840,00:34:45.350,今儿这个时候皇上正高兴,00:34:43.600,00:34:46.220,His Majesty is very pleased at the moment.
00:34:45.640,00:34:48.100,您又何苦去惹皇上不痛快呢,00:34:46.520,00:34:48.720,Why would you go displease him?
00:34:49.920,00:34:51.790,本宫不信皇上不念旧情,00:34:50.740,00:34:52.620,I don’t believe His Majesty feels no affection for the past.
00:34:52.040,00:34:54.950,旧情呢 不过是平日顺嘴说说,00:34:52.960,00:34:55.880,"""Affection for the past"" stays in the past."
00:34:55.440,00:34:57.630,如今有新人在怀,00:34:56.280,00:34:58.480,"Now that His Majesty has a newly favored concubine,"
00:34:58.120,00:35:01.430,还哪有工夫念旧情呢,00:34:59.000,00:35:02.400,he has no time to think about the past.
00:35:02.000,00:35:02.750,新人,00:35:02.780,00:35:04.320,A newly favored concubine?
00:35:04.840,00:35:06.310,你说的是方才唱歌的人,00:35:05.660,00:35:07.220,You mean the woman who was singing?
00:35:06.880,00:35:07.940,娘娘好耳力,00:35:07.480,00:35:08.860,Your Highness surely has good hearing.
00:35:08.280,00:35:10.230,那可是新封的安贵人,00:35:08.860,00:35:10.880,That is the newly promoted Noble Lady An.
00:35:10.520,00:35:11.390,哪来的什么安贵人,00:35:11.040,00:35:12.280,What Noble Lady An?
00:35:11.680,00:35:13.350,就是从前的安常在呀,00:35:12.400,00:35:14.000,She was previously Attendant An.
00:35:14.280,00:35:16.580,娘娘瞧您 这大太阳晒得,00:35:14.920,00:35:16.180,"Your Highness,"
00:35:17.040,00:35:19.500,脸也白了 汗珠子也下来了,00:35:16.400,00:35:20.040,"your face became pale and sweaty under the burning sun,"
00:35:19.760,00:35:21.190,连声调都高了,00:35:20.520,00:35:22.060,and even your voice got higher.
00:35:21.520,00:35:24.270,可这安美人冰肌玉骨,00:35:22.440,00:35:24.860,"But Lady An’s skin is soft and smooth,"
00:35:24.640,00:35:26.550,笑起来跟花儿似的,00:35:25.380,00:35:27.280,and she is smiling like a flower.
00:35:27.000,00:35:29.190,那声音比水还软,00:35:27.600,00:35:29.800,Her voice is even softer than water.
00:35:29.880,00:35:34.390,您自己说 皇上还愿意见您吗,00:35:30.700,00:35:35.260,"Does Your Highness still think that
 His Majesty will want to see you?"
00:35:39.800,00:35:42.430,奴才 就告辞了,00:35:40.540,00:35:42.900,"Your Highness, I'll take my leave now."
00:35:51.040,00:35:51.830,回宫,00:35:52.020,00:35:53.220,I'll return.
00:35:55.240,00:35:57.390,咱们什么时候能回去呀,00:35:56.020,00:35:58.340,When are we going back? I want to go home.
00:35:58.000,00:36:00.070,年妃娘娘大老远跑来,,,
00:36:00.400,00:36:01.620,皇上为什么不见她,00:35:58.760,00:36:02.860,"Consort Nian came all the way here.
Why didn’t His Majesty want to see her?"
00:36:04.800,00:36:06.950,端妃久病 年妃失宠,00:36:05.540,00:36:08.000,"Consort Honnête has long been ill
and Consort Nian fell out of favor."
00:36:07.880,00:36:09.230,皇上根本没叫她,00:36:08.680,00:36:10.700,His Majesty did not invite them.
00:36:10.320,00:36:11.710,她怎么自己跑来了,,,
00:36:12.480,00:36:14.270,年妃娘娘白跑一趟,00:36:11.220,00:36:13.020,Why did she come here?
00:36:14.760,00:36:15.980,一定大发雷霆,00:36:13.160,00:36:16.420,She must be furious about making a futile trip.
00:36:16.440,00:36:18.070,贵人不如回去看看吧,00:36:17.220,00:36:19.140,"My Lady, you should go check on her."
00:36:18.800,00:36:19.940,她那个烈火性子,,,
00:36:20.960,00:36:22.150,我又有什么办法呢,00:36:19.560,00:36:22.860,What can I do about her fiery temper?
00:36:27.280,00:36:29.660,皇上 温宜刚换了地方,,,
00:36:30.160,00:36:31.630,臣妾怕她不习惯,00:36:28.240,00:36:32.240,"Your Majesty, Wenyi is not very used to being in a new place."
00:36:32.240,00:36:34.910,不如臣妾先带她回去了,00:36:33.040,00:36:35.720,May I take her back now?
00:36:35.320,00:36:35.910,也好,,,
00:36:36.720,00:36:37.470,是,00:36:36.100,00:36:37.220,Certainly.
,,,00:36:37.540,00:36:38.560,Yes.
00:36:41.360,00:36:43.870,皇上若是觉得安贵人歌喉动听,00:36:42.260,00:36:44.780,"If Your Majesty likes Lady An's singing,"
00:36:44.240,00:36:45.030,不如让安贵人,,,
00:36:45.360,00:36:47.230,再多唱几首给皇上听啊,00:36:45.180,00:36:47.780,why not let her sing more songs for Your Majesty?
00:36:47.440,00:36:48.070,好,00:36:48.120,00:36:48.960,Sure.
00:36:48.600,00:36:51.430,那今晚就留安贵人在朕的身边吧,00:36:49.300,00:36:51.980,I will select Lady An to stay with me tonight.
00:36:51.680,00:36:52.430,好啊,00:36:52.540,00:36:53.440,Certainly.
00:36:54.280,00:36:54.950,来,00:36:54.880,00:36:55.920,Here.
00:37:19.280,00:37:20.630,娘娘吉祥,00:37:20.100,00:37:21.460,Peace to Your Highness.
00:37:22.400,00:37:24.230,皇上赏的酒好喝吗,00:37:23.300,00:37:25.200,How was His Majesty's wine?
00:37:25.760,00:37:28.590,安贵人唱的歌好不好听,00:37:26.680,00:37:29.520,Did you enjoy Lady An's singing?
00:37:29.920,00:37:30.830,娘娘息怒,00:37:30.900,00:37:32.600,"Please don't be angry, Your Highness."
00:37:32.120,00:37:33.180,息怒,00:37:33.040,00:37:34.260,Am I angry?
00:37:35.040,00:37:36.910,本宫哪还敢怒啊,00:37:35.860,00:37:37.860,Do I even dare to be angry?
00:37:38.600,00:37:42.380,只见新人笑 不闻旧人哭,00:37:39.400,00:37:43.300,"His Majesty sees the smiles of the new
concubines but not the tears of the old ones."
00:37:44.040,00:37:46.750,你们在琼华岛宴饮听歌,00:37:44.760,00:37:47.420,You were all entertained at the banquet.
00:37:47.600,00:37:50.790,本宫却在烈日炎炎下受尽折辱,00:37:48.400,00:37:51.160,But I was humiliated standing in the scorching sun.
00:37:51.440,00:37:53.270,娘娘 安氏不过是以歌艺,,,
00:37:53.560,00:37:54.830,博取皇上宠幸罢了,00:37:52.300,00:37:55.420,"Your Highness, An was just trying to
gain His Majesty's favor with her voice."
00:37:55.160,00:37:56.220,娘娘不必在意,00:37:55.840,00:37:57.220,There's no need to worry about her.
00:37:56.600,00:38:00.470,走了个沈眉庄 来了一个甄嬛,00:37:57.480,00:38:00.920,"After Shen Meizhuang, there was Zhen Huan."
00:38:01.520,00:38:04.190,去了个甄嬛 又来了个安陵容,00:38:02.420,00:38:05.180,"After Zhen Huan, here comes An Lingrong."
00:38:06.000,00:38:09.190,个个狐媚妖冶 迷惑圣心,00:38:06.760,00:38:09.840,Each one even more bewitching than the last.
00:38:09.640,00:38:12.100,为什么 为什么皇上会宠幸她们,00:38:10.540,00:38:13.060,Why? Why would His Majesty favor them?
00:38:20.880,00:38:22.150,你哭什么,00:38:21.700,00:38:23.360,Why are you crying?
00:38:23.240,00:38:25.030,该哭的应该是本宫,00:38:23.760,00:38:25.820,I'm the one who should be crying.
00:38:27.000,00:38:28.830,你是皇上的女儿,00:38:27.740,00:38:29.900,You are His Majesty's daughter.
00:38:29.800,00:38:31.310,无论你做错什么,,,
00:38:31.640,00:38:32.950,皇上都不会怪你的,00:38:30.360,00:38:33.760,"No matter what you do wrong, he will not blame you."
00:38:33.760,00:38:35.310,可是本宫算什么,00:38:34.640,00:38:36.260,But what am I to him?
00:38:36.720,00:38:38.350,高兴便宠幸,00:38:36.720,00:38:38.520,"He favors me when he's happy,"
00:38:38.880,00:38:41.870,不高兴便扔在一边任人浚辱践踏,00:38:39.660,00:38:42.700,"when he's not, he subjects me to the humiliation of others!"
00:38:43.360,00:38:45.870,哭 你有什么可哭的,00:38:44.200,00:38:46.080,"Cry, what is there to cry for?"
00:38:46.120,00:38:46.910,娘娘息怒,00:38:46.440,00:38:47.840,Your Highness!
00:38:47.440,00:38:50.000,温宜毕竟还小 她不懂事的,00:38:48.140,00:38:51.080,Wenyi is just a child. She doesn't understand anything.
00:38:53.240,00:38:53.990,不哭啊,00:38:53.240,00:38:54.720,Don't cry.
00:38:57.120,00:39:02.990,我的孩子 我的孩子,00:38:57.740,00:38:59.560,My child ...
,,,00:39:02.740,00:39:04.060,My child ...
00:39:06.040,00:39:07.390,我的孩子,00:39:06.820,00:39:08.240,My child ...
00:39:09.440,00:39:11.470,若本宫也有孩子,00:39:10.240,00:39:12.280,If I had saved my child ...
00:39:12.920,00:39:16.190,他也会哭 也会笑,00:39:13.680,00:39:16.960,He would also cry ... He would laugh ...
00:39:17.760,00:39:22.030,皇上也不至于不理会本宫了,00:39:18.660,00:39:22.760,And His Majesty would never neglect me.
00:39:25.280,00:39:26.710,我的孩子,00:39:26.040,00:39:27.620,My child!
00:39:28.880,00:39:30.100,娘娘快别伤神了,00:39:28.800,00:39:30.920,"Your Highness, it's not the time to be sad."
00:39:30.480,00:39:31.310,娘娘细想想,00:39:31.220,00:39:32.720,"If Your Highness recalls carefully,"
00:39:31.840,00:39:34.070,今日之事是否太蹊跷了,00:39:32.780,00:39:35.280,wasn't it too odd today?
00:39:34.640,00:39:36.430,皇上事先并未传召娘娘,00:39:35.700,00:39:37.720,His Majesty wouldn't have informed you on short notice
00:39:37.000,00:39:39.270,更不会临时吩咐娘娘去太液池,00:39:37.820,00:39:40.080,and didn't summon Your Highness.
,,,00:39:40.940,00:39:41.860,Nursemaid.
00:39:40.280,00:39:43.900,那么究竟是谁想要让娘娘入园,00:39:42.040,00:39:44.980,So who was it that wanted Your Highness to be there
00:39:44.480,00:39:46.150,并看见安贵人一事呢,00:39:45.400,00:39:47.460,and see Lady An's performance?
00:39:48.280,00:39:49.670,娘娘您还是万幸的,00:39:49.020,00:39:50.520,It was fortunate that
00:39:49.960,00:39:52.260,没有因安贵人受宠一事而发作,00:39:50.660,00:39:53.300,Your Highness didn't throw a tantrum about her.
00:39:52.640,00:39:53.270,否则的话,,,
00:39:53.640,00:39:56.100,娘娘现在岂能在翊坤宫伤神,00:39:53.640,00:39:56.840,"Otherwise, Your Highness wouldn't be
speaking in your palace right now."
00:39:56.520,00:39:58.230,只怕皇上早已怪罪了,00:39:57.260,00:39:58.980,You would have been punished by His Majesty.
00:39:58.800,00:39:59.710,是啊,00:39:59.680,00:40:00.580,Yes.
00:40:00.400,00:40:02.390,是个脸生的小太监传的话,00:40:01.260,00:40:03.380,I don't remember seeing the messenger eunuch before.
00:40:03.920,00:40:06.270,说皇上在太液池设宴,00:40:05.020,00:40:07.580,He said His Majesty was hosting a banquet by Taiye Lake
00:40:06.920,00:40:10.230,问本宫是否得空前去,00:40:07.780,00:40:10.540,and asked if I would attend.
00:40:14.480,00:40:18.830,是甄嬛 是皇后,00:40:15.280,00:40:16.940,Was it Zhen Huan?
,,,00:40:18.760,00:40:20.260,Or the Empress?
00:40:20.400,00:40:21.950,她们要害本宫,00:40:21.200,00:40:22.760,They set it up.
00:40:23.000,00:40:24.790,她们个个都要害本宫,00:40:23.960,00:40:26.020,They all want to set me up!
00:40:26.360,00:40:26.990,是了,00:40:27.080,00:40:28.100,This is it.
00:40:27.880,00:40:30.260,皇上身边向来给娘娘传话的,00:40:28.920,00:40:30.980,His Majesty's messengers to Your Highness
00:40:30.560,00:40:32.230,只有苏公公和小厦子而已,00:40:31.320,00:40:33.100,are only Mr. Su and Xiao-Xiazi.
00:40:32.680,00:40:33.660,怎么凭空跑出来,,,
00:40:33.920,00:40:35.270,一个脸生的小太监呢,00:40:33.780,00:40:35.980,He wouldn't send a new eunuch that you had never met.
00:40:35.680,00:40:36.950,让人无从查起,00:40:36.440,00:40:38.100,And now we can't identify him.
00:40:38.120,00:40:40.580,可莞嫔也好 皇后也好,00:40:38.820,00:40:41.620,"But whether it was Concubine Sourire or the Empress,"
00:40:41.480,00:40:43.270,娘娘还是快别生气了,,,
00:40:43.680,00:40:45.270,这要是传到皇上耳中,00:40:42.720,00:40:44.380,Your Highness must stop being angry.
00:40:45.520,00:40:47.270,只怕皇上还要怪罪呢,00:40:44.580,00:40:47.780,In case His Majesty hears and punishes you.
00:40:54.040,00:40:55.830,皇上都不愿见本宫了,00:40:55.000,00:40:56.800,His Majesty will not see me anymore.
00:40:57.120,00:40:58.430,哪来的怪罪,00:40:57.980,00:40:59.640,Why would he be offended?
00:41:01.720,00:41:04.510,皇上此时不见娘娘 倒是好事,00:41:02.380,00:41:05.420,It's understandable that His Majesty avoids seeing Your Highness.
00:41:05.760,00:41:07.870,娘娘正处在风口浪尖之上,00:41:06.200,00:41:08.840,"Your Highness is in the ""teeth of the storm""."
00:41:08.480,00:41:10.780,皇上还似以前一般对娘娘,00:41:09.480,00:41:11.520,"If His Majesty treats you the same as before,"
00:41:11.280,00:41:13.350,不是将娘娘放在是非之中吗,00:41:12.180,00:41:14.760,it will only cause more trouble to Your Highness.
00:41:14.240,00:41:16.190,莞嫔失子已成定局了,00:41:15.200,00:41:17.360,Concubine Sourire has lost her child.
00:41:17.440,00:41:18.870,娘娘纵使再冤枉,00:41:18.280,00:41:19.960,"Even if Your Highness feels aggrieved,"
00:41:19.160,00:41:21.390,皇上总也得冷落娘娘几天啊,00:41:19.960,00:41:22.260,His Majesty has to refrain from seeing you for now
00:41:21.880,00:41:23.830,才好封住六宫之口,00:41:22.700,00:41:24.800,to quiet down the gossip in the harem.
00:41:24.800,00:41:28.390,再说 若皇上真的在气头之上,00:41:25.720,00:41:29.320,"And if His Majesty really is mad at Your Highness,"
00:41:29.240,00:41:30.990,娘娘避一避才好呢,00:41:30.280,00:41:32.120,Your Highness must avoid upsetting him.
00:41:31.840,00:41:32.980,小别胜新婚,,,
00:41:33.360,00:41:34.110,皇上总有一天,00:41:32.580,00:41:34.040,“A separation rekindles a couple's passion.”
00:41:34.360,00:41:35.950,会想起娘娘的好处来,00:41:34.240,00:41:36.820,One day His Majesty will remember Your Highness's goodness.
00:41:36.280,00:41:38.580,到那时候再相见不是更好吗,00:41:36.980,00:41:39.440,Isn't that a better time to see him?
00:41:38.920,00:41:40.510,本宫一时失宠,00:41:39.740,00:41:41.460,"Now that I lost my position,"
00:41:41.760,00:41:43.950,安氏就顺杆子爬上来了,00:41:42.460,00:41:44.660,"An has ""climbed up the pole""."
00:41:44.920,00:41:46.350,实在是可恨,00:41:45.640,00:41:47.080,How despicable!
00:41:47.120,00:41:48.310,那安氏算什么,00:41:47.940,00:41:49.140,An is nobody.
00:41:48.640,00:41:50.430,不过是小门小户家的女子,00:41:49.420,00:41:51.240,She came from an unknown family.
00:41:50.640,00:41:52.910,皇上一时贪新鲜想起来罢了,00:41:51.540,00:41:53.720,Her freshness as a concubine is temporary.
00:41:53.600,00:41:56.160,这些年皇上对娘娘如何,,,
00:41:56.600,00:41:58.390,娘娘您是最清楚的,00:41:54.440,00:41:59.040,Your Highness knows how His Majesty treats you.
00:41:58.960,00:42:02.390,任凭谁也分不了娘娘您的宠爱啊,00:41:59.780,00:42:03.220,How can anyone take away Your Highness's favor?
00:42:03.720,00:42:04.860,你先回去吧,00:42:04.540,00:42:05.860,You can go now.
00:42:06.000,00:42:07.350,本宫自己想一想,00:42:06.840,00:42:08.340,I will think over it.
00:42:08.320,00:42:10.310,是 嫔妾告退,00:42:09.020,00:42:11.020,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
