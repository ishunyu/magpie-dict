00:02:32.900,00:02:34.100,恭送皇后娘娘,00:02:32.900,00:02:34.614,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:02:35.570,00:02:36.770,你的脸是怎么了,00:02:35.570,00:02:37.542,What happened to your face?
00:02:38.070,00:02:40.060,是奴婢自己做错了事情,00:02:38.070,00:02:40.060,It was my own blunder.
00:02:51.420,00:02:52.870,斐雯 别浇花了,00:02:51.420,00:02:52.999,"Petunia, stop watering the plants."
00:02:53.170,00:02:54.250,去把这个月的份例拿来,00:02:52.999,00:02:54.670,Go collect the stipend for this month.
00:02:54.670,00:02:55.200,是,00:02:54.670,00:02:55.629,Yes.
00:02:58.340,00:02:59.000,斐雯,00:02:58.340,00:02:59.815,Petunia.
00:03:00.220,00:03:01.130,你这是要去哪儿啊,00:03:00.220,00:03:01.340,Where are you going?
00:03:01.340,00:03:03.080,姑姑浣碧姑娘盼咐我,00:03:01.340,00:03:03.350,"Madam, Jade instructed me"
00:03:03.350,00:03:04.460,去内务府拿份例,00:03:03.350,00:03:04.909,to collect the stipend from the Household Department.
00:03:04.720,00:03:06.630,是吗 我也要去呢 一起吧,00:03:04.909,00:03:07.215,"Oh? That's where I'm headed too.
Let's go together."
00:03:21.110,00:03:23.780,礼部给公主定了三个封号,00:03:21.110,00:03:24.070,"The Ministry of Rites has selected
three honorary names for the princess."
00:03:24.070,00:03:24.730,你喜欢哪个,00:03:24.070,00:03:25.416,Which one do you like?
00:03:25.780,00:03:27.700,礼部自然是挑好的字眼来凑,00:03:25.780,00:03:28.160,The Ministry of Rites always selects excellent names.
00:03:28.160,00:03:28.900,都是一样的,00:03:28.160,00:03:29.672,They are equally good.
00:03:30.210,00:03:31.370,公主性子沉静,00:03:30.210,00:03:31.869,The princess has a calm quiet temperament.
00:03:32.120,00:03:34.330,倒是弘瞻只怕是个顽皮的,00:03:32.120,00:03:34.481,But I'm afraid Hongyan might be a naughty child.
00:03:34.750,00:03:38.160,朕倒觉得皇子活泼开朗些好,00:03:34.750,00:03:38.674,"In fact, I believe it's good for a prince to be rambunctious and outgoing."
00:03:39.510,00:03:41.370,弘时总是老气横秋,00:03:39.510,00:03:41.630,"Unlike Hongshi, who is always so cheerless, like an old man."
00:03:41.630,00:03:43.460,见了朕就像老鼠见了猫,00:03:41.630,00:03:44.317,He acts like a mouse before a cat when he sees me.
00:03:45.350,00:03:46.710,皇上自己要做严父,00:03:45.350,00:03:47.430,Your Majesty chooses to be an exacting father.
00:03:47.430,00:03:48.550,不怪孩子害怕,00:03:47.430,00:03:49.350,You can't blame the child for being intimidated.
00:03:49.350,00:03:52.310,朕答应你在他们面前只做慈父,00:03:49.350,00:03:52.480,"I promise you I will be only a kind father
in front of our children."
00:03:53.600,00:03:54.810,你也正经想想,00:03:53.600,00:03:55.286,You should give serious thought to
00:03:55.060,00:03:57.270,咱们的公主择个名号才是,00:03:55.286,00:03:57.270,selecting the honorary name for our princess.
00:04:00.070,00:04:01.850,身无彩凤双飞翼,,,

our hearts are connected by the divine rhino's horn."""
00:04:06.580,00:04:09.240,公主的封号便叫灵犀可好,00:04:06.580,00:04:09.750,"For the princess's honorary name,
how about the rhino's horn: ""Lingxi""?"
,,,00:04:09.750,00:04:10.896,Lingxi.
00:04:09.750,00:04:13.990,灵犀 灵犀,00:04:12.669,00:04:14.080,Lingxi.
00:04:14.960,00:04:17.170,朕与你十年来心有灵犀,00:04:14.960,00:04:17.170,"For the past ten years, our hearts
have been connected as one."
00:04:17.880,00:04:20.490,咱们的女儿就是灵犀公主,00:04:17.880,00:04:20.490,"So, our daughter is Princess Lingxi."
00:04:22.340,00:04:23.380,皇上小主,00:04:22.340,00:04:23.852,"Your Majesty, My Lady,"
00:04:24.300,00:04:26.380,阿哥和公主到了该喂奶的时候了,00:04:24.300,00:04:26.380,it's time for the prince and princess to be nursed.
00:04:26.890,00:04:27.800,乳母要抱出去了,00:04:26.890,00:04:28.180,The wet nurse will escort them out.
00:04:28.180,00:04:28.670,好,00:04:28.180,00:04:29.470,Very well.
00:04:29.470,00:04:30.050,是,00:04:29.470,00:04:30.650,Yes.
00:04:35.940,00:04:38.100,这丫头跟了你许多年,00:04:35.940,00:04:38.200,That girl has been with you for several years.
00:04:39.190,00:04:41.560,倒是长得与你有几分相似了,00:04:39.190,00:04:41.786,"She bears a resemblance to you
now that she has grown older."
00:04:42.940,00:04:44.530,这话从前皇上就说过,00:04:42.940,00:04:44.640,Your Majesty has said this before.
00:04:45.160,00:04:47.190,说沈碧的眼睛长得像臣妾,00:04:45.160,00:04:47.190,You said Jade has similar eyes to mine.
00:04:47.450,00:04:50.530,从前浣碧只是有几分姿色罢了,00:04:47.190,00:04:50.530,Jade was only of middling beauty before.
00:04:51.290,00:04:52.490,纵使眼睛像你,00:04:51.290,00:04:53.290,"Although her eyes were like yours,"
00:04:53.290,00:04:56.000,也是个只知穿红着绿的丫头,00:04:53.290,00:04:56.343,"she was just a girl who adorned herself
""all over with red and green."""
00:04:56.960,00:04:58.040,如今年岁大了,00:04:56.960,00:04:58.840,"Now that she has gotten older,"
00:04:58.840,00:05:02.040,在气韵上倒与你有几分相似,00:04:58.840,00:05:02.040,her temperament has grown more like yours.
00:05:02.960,00:05:04.080,皇上今日是怎么了,00:05:02.960,00:05:05.081,What has gotten into Your Majesty today?
00:05:04.930,00:05:06.710,对着臣妾的一个侍女这样称赞,00:05:05.081,00:05:07.140,You keep on praising a maid like this.
00:05:07.140,00:05:08.090,没得叫人笑话,00:05:07.140,00:05:08.800,It will provoke the laughter of others.
00:05:08.720,00:05:11.710,做额娘的人了反而小气起来,00:05:09.060,00:05:11.840,"You are a mother now, but you become even more like a child."
00:05:13.180,00:05:15.390,沈碧若不是你的近身侍女,00:05:13.180,00:05:15.541,"If Jade were not your favored maid,"
00:05:15.890,00:05:17.760,朕还未必肯说这几句话,00:05:15.890,00:05:18.060,I might not even bother to give this compliment.
00:05:19.860,00:05:23.310,不过是看见浣碧想起胧月来,00:05:19.860,00:05:23.310,It was only that her growth reminded me of Longyue.
00:05:24.490,00:05:25.730,那孩子越来越大,00:05:24.490,00:05:25.730,Longyue is growing up by the day.
00:05:26.660,00:05:29.400,样子倒有些像你,00:05:26.660,00:05:29.400,She looks quite like you now.
00:05:30.580,00:05:32.160,等胧月再长大些,00:05:30.580,00:05:32.311,"When Longyue gets older,"
00:05:32.790,00:05:33.780,朕就让她回来,00:05:32.790,00:05:33.969,I will allow her to return here
00:05:34.700,00:05:36.660,不叫你们母女分离,00:05:34.700,00:05:37.037,so that mother and daughter are no longer separated.
00:05:42.960,00:05:45.170,胧月喜欢这个小兔子吗,00:05:42.960,00:05:45.170,"Longyue, do you like this little bunny?"
00:05:45.550,00:05:48.920,额娘我想要小老虎,00:05:45.550,00:05:48.680,"Mother, I'd like a little tiger."
00:05:49.930,00:05:53.140,小老虎太难剪了 额娘不会呀,00:05:49.175,00:05:53.140,"Oh dear, it's too difficult to cut out a little tiger.
I don't know how to make one."
00:05:53.600,00:05:56.640,额娘都会额娘什么都会,00:05:53.680,00:05:56.640,"Mother, you can make anything.
You know everything."
00:05:57.890,00:06:01.180,好 为了我家胧月 额娘什么都会,00:05:57.890,00:06:01.180,"Of course, I can do anything for my Longyue."
00:06:01.570,00:06:03.020,小老虎也学着剪,00:06:01.570,00:06:03.363,I will learn how to make a little tiger.
00:06:08.570,00:06:09.480,给娘娘请安,00:06:08.570,00:06:09.480,Peace to Your Highness.
00:06:12.160,00:06:12.770,起来吧,00:06:12.160,00:06:12.996,You may rise.
00:06:13.410,00:06:14.200,谢娘娘,00:06:13.410,00:06:14.351,I thank Your Highness.
00:06:15.700,00:06:16.740,贵妃娘娘说,00:06:15.700,00:06:16.929,Her Noble Highness says
00:06:17.160,00:06:18.990,前几日没有得空,00:06:17.160,00:06:18.990,she hasn't had a chance to see you recently.
00:06:19.420,00:06:20.660,今日正赶上天气好,00:06:19.420,00:06:20.811,"Since the weather is very nice today,"
00:06:21.460,00:06:24.700,想要娘娘到永寿宫去一聚呢,00:06:21.460,00:06:25.086,"she invites Your Highness to join her
at the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:06:26.630,00:06:29.750,好 你先去吧 我即刻就去,00:06:26.630,00:06:30.179,"Very well, you may return first.
I will be there shortly."
00:06:30.390,00:06:31.040,是,00:06:30.390,00:06:31.115,Yes.
00:06:34.760,00:06:36.800,娘娘 要带着公主过去吗,00:06:34.760,00:06:36.960,"Your Highness, will you take the princess with you?"
00:06:42.650,00:06:45.890,胧月 你在这里等着额娘,00:06:42.650,00:06:45.890,"Longyue, stay here and wait for me."
00:06:46.740,00:06:47.820,额娘去去就来,00:06:46.740,00:06:48.377,I'll be back soon.
00:06:52.620,00:06:53.860,赶快哄公主睡午觉,00:06:52.600,00:06:54.880,Lull the princess to sleep. I'll return soon.
00:06:54.280,00:06:54.770,我去去就回,,,
00:06:54.950,00:06:55.570,是,00:06:55.000,00:06:56.256,Yes.
00:07:08.510,00:07:09.250,敬妃来了,00:07:08.510,00:07:10.065,Consort Estime has arrived.
00:07:16.310,00:07:17.170,贵妃娘娘,00:07:16.310,00:07:17.727,Your Noble Highness.
00:07:19.270,00:07:19.970,姐姐坐,00:07:19.270,00:07:20.913,"Estime, have a seat."
00:07:34.990,00:07:36.230,今日难得有空,00:07:34.990,00:07:36.419,I finally have some time to myself today.
00:07:36.990,00:07:38.730,咱们姐妹好好说说话吧,00:07:36.990,00:07:39.202,We sisters finally have some time to catch up.
00:07:40.370,00:07:42.200,贵妃娘娘喜得龙凤双子,00:07:40.370,00:07:42.540,"Your Noble Highness just gave birth
to ""a dragon and a phoenix"""
00:07:42.960,00:07:44.820,又要应付宫里的礼仪琐事,00:07:42.960,00:07:46.320,"and have to deal with the
burdensome etiquette and palace affairs."
00:07:45.290,00:07:46.330,只恨不能分身,,,
00:07:47.460,00:07:49.080,我哪敢前来打扰呢,00:07:47.460,00:07:49.306,I dare not come and disturb you.
00:07:50.510,00:07:52.370,姐姐如今都称我娘娘了,00:07:50.510,00:07:52.672,"Estime, you are calling me ""Noble Highness"" now."
00:07:52.880,00:07:54.290,看来真是要生分了,00:07:52.880,00:07:54.516,It seems we might have become estranged.
00:07:55.600,00:07:56.840,纵然是妹妹客气,00:07:55.600,00:07:57.029,"You are being courteous, Lumière,"
00:07:57.600,00:07:59.010,到底是尊卑有别,00:07:57.600,00:07:59.482,but there is a difference between inferior and superior.
00:07:59.850,00:08:01.010,继华贵妃之后,,,
00:08:01.430,00:08:02.670,妹妹任贵妃之位,00:07:59.850,00:08:02.640,"You are the second Noble Consort
after Noble Consort Fleur."
00:08:03.190,00:08:05.300,实在是实至名归的呀,00:08:03.190,00:08:05.686,This title is truly well deserved.
00:08:06.480,00:08:08.020,若论起品德资历来,00:08:06.480,00:08:08.534,"In regards to merit and experience,"
00:08:09.440,00:08:11.100,难道姐姐就做不得贵妃吗,00:08:09.440,00:08:11.100,are you not also deserving of this title?
00:08:15.780,00:08:18.440,贵妃也不都是一样的,00:08:15.780,00:08:18.440,"Even so, not all Noble Consorts are the same."
00:08:19.410,00:08:20.950,我记得妹妹离宫之后,00:08:19.410,00:08:21.410,"I remember that after you left the palace,"
00:08:21.410,00:08:22.900,皇上有一次提起妹妹,00:08:21.440,00:08:23.015,His Majesty once mentioned
00:08:23.710,00:08:25.540,还大赞在御花园中,,,
00:08:25.880,00:08:27.210,初遇妹妹的景象,00:08:23.683,00:08:27.868,how he first met you in the Imperial Garden.
00:08:28.290,00:08:31.630,他赞妹妹莞尔一笑 嫣然无方,00:08:28.513,00:08:32.383,"He could not cease praising your beautiful smile,
and said nothing in this world could describe it."
00:08:33.340,00:08:38.050,这些年皇上对妹妹是念念不忘啊,00:08:33.340,00:08:38.436,His Majesty had never forgotten you all those years.
00:08:38.970,00:08:42.090,年轻的时候谁不是容色倾城,00:08:38.970,00:08:42.433,"""One glance at a youthful lady can bring an entire city to its knees."""
00:08:43.640,00:08:45.130,只是红颜弹指老,00:08:43.640,00:08:45.956,"But that beauty ""withers in the snap of a finger."""
00:08:46.480,00:08:48.850,不过是眼睁睁看着君恩如流水,,,
00:08:49.270,00:08:50.560,匆匆不回头而已,00:08:46.480,00:08:52.000,"One can do nothing but watch His Majesty's favor
flow away like a running river - the water of no return."
00:08:52.900,00:08:57.440,后宫中的女人过得好 过得不好,00:08:52.900,00:08:57.943,"In the harem, some women's lives flourish,
while others' wither,"
00:08:58.830,00:09:00.320,都是如此一生罢了,00:08:58.924,00:09:01.301,"but ultimately, all of us live the same life."
00:09:01.790,00:09:04.990,好在皇上心里是有妹妹的,00:09:01.790,00:09:05.333,It's fortunate that His Majesty has you in his heart.
00:09:06.750,00:09:07.990,姐姐一向慧智,,,
00:09:09.040,00:09:10.530,又对世事洞若观火,00:09:06.750,00:09:10.520,"You've always been wise, Estime, and able
to see everything as clearly as a bright flame."
00:09:11.880,00:09:13.670,既然明知皇上对我不薄,00:09:11.880,00:09:14.247,"Since you know that His Majesty treats me generously,"
00:09:14.510,00:09:16.290,姐姐又为何要与我作对呢,00:09:14.549,00:09:17.096,then why do you choose to go against me?
00:09:19.970,00:09:21.050,你已经知道了,00:09:19.970,00:09:21.959,You've found out about it.
00:09:24.520,00:09:26.180,槿汐与苏培盛一事,00:09:24.520,00:09:26.801,It was you who told the Empress
00:09:27.150,00:09:28.640,便是姐姐告诉皇后的,00:09:27.177,00:09:29.130,about Jinxi and Su Peisheng.
00:09:29.940,00:09:31.270,他们都是谨慎的人,00:09:29.940,00:09:32.000,"They are both discreet,"
00:09:32.480,00:09:33.440,唯一的破绽,,,
00:09:33.690,00:09:35.480,便是那枚柳叶合心的缨络,00:09:32.480,00:09:35.480,"and the only evidence was that sachet
embroidered with willow leaves."
00:09:36.110,00:09:38.440,曾被姐姐看出是槿汐的手艺,00:09:36.110,00:09:38.440,You recognized that it was Jinxi's work.
00:09:39.660,00:09:40.740,当日在场之人,,,
00:09:41.200,00:09:43.110,除了我 唯有你和眉庄,00:09:39.660,00:09:43.080,"Only you and Meizhuang were present, aside from me."
00:09:44.200,00:09:45.190,而那段时日,,,
00:09:46.080,00:09:48.410,姐姐曾出入景仁宫次数不少,00:09:44.200,00:09:48.400,"Also, at that time you frequently visited
 the Palace of Great Benevolence."
00:09:51.540,00:09:53.250,贵妃娘娘冰雪聪明,00:09:51.540,00:09:53.722,Your Noble Highness has a brilliant mind.
00:09:53.920,00:09:56.760,既然已经知道 何苦又来问我呢,00:09:53.920,00:09:56.760,"Why would you ask me
when you already know this?"
00:09:59.140,00:10:00.170,你知道也好,00:09:59.140,00:10:00.472,It's good that you know now.
00:10:01.100,00:10:04.090,省得我终日悬心 寝食难安,00:10:01.100,00:10:04.090,"It will save me from a troubled conscience
 when I eat and sleep."
00:10:05.770,00:10:09.350,这次是我害你终是我对你不住,00:10:05.770,00:10:08.247,I was the one who harmed you this time.
,,,00:10:08.436,00:10:10.000,I owe you an apology.
00:10:11.440,00:10:14.520,姐姐不争圣宠 又甚少与人交恶,00:10:11.440,00:10:14.520,"You never compete for His Majesty's favor,
and seldom run afoul of anyone."
00:10:15.780,00:10:18.270,当年华妃独大时亦可忍辱保身,00:10:15.780,00:10:18.798,"Even when Consort Fleur was in power,
you were able to endure her and protect yourself."
00:10:19.110,00:10:20.070,今日种种,,,
00:10:20.910,00:10:22.900,不过是想留住胧月在身边,00:10:19.110,00:10:22.880,You only did this to keep Longyue by your side.
00:10:30.080,00:10:31.040,若无胧月,00:10:30.080,00:10:32.200,"If not for Longyue,"
00:10:32.290,00:10:35.040,我这后半生怕无半点欢愉了,00:10:32.290,00:10:35.380,I would have no moment of joy for the rest of my life.
00:10:37.170,00:10:40.760,妹妹 你自服侍皇上 圣宠优渥,00:10:37.170,00:10:40.760,"Lumière, you've been deeply in His Majesty's favor
 ever since you first served him."
00:10:42.010,00:10:44.050,哪里知道我这深宫寂寞的感觉,00:10:41.710,00:10:44.653,How would you know the loneliness I feel in my desolate palace?
00:10:45.810,00:10:46.670,你知道吗,00:10:45.810,00:10:47.056,You know what?
00:10:47.890,00:10:50.180,我宫里一共有三百二十六块砖石,00:10:47.890,00:10:50.482,There are three hundred and twenty-six masonry stones in my palace.
00:10:50.900,00:10:51.930,可是这每一块,,,
00:10:52.690,00:10:54.300,我都抚摸过无数遍了,00:10:50.900,00:10:54.544,I've touched each and every one of them thousands of times.
00:10:55.530,00:10:57.890,其中还有三十一块,00:10:55.530,00:11:01.080,"And I know that fine cracks have appeared
on thirty-one of them."
00:10:58.610,00:11:00.270,已经出现了细碎的裂纹,,,
00:11:02.070,00:11:06.320,否则我将如何度过这漫漫长夜呢,00:11:02.070,00:11:06.320,How else could I get through the endless nights?
00:11:08.370,00:11:10.860,其实我早就知道,00:11:08.370,00:11:11.200,"In fact, I knew from the beginning"
00:11:12.500,00:11:15.120,我不过是皇上制衡华妃的,00:11:12.500,00:11:16.440,"that I was only His Majesty's pawn
to check Consort Fleur's influence."
00:11:15.460,00:11:16.450,一枚棋子罢了,,,
00:11:17.550,00:11:20.460,这些话姐姐从没说过,00:11:17.550,00:11:20.573,"You've never told me such things before, Estime."
00:11:22.260,00:11:24.420,那时候你把胧月托付给我,00:11:22.260,00:11:24.571,"When you entrusted me with Longyue,"
00:11:25.510,00:11:27.170,我一则是为有个依靠,00:11:25.510,00:11:28.500,"I wished to depend on her for the rest of my life,"
00:11:28.520,00:11:31.510,二则是想打发这长夜寂寞,00:11:28.500,00:11:31.669,and to have some company to pass the lonesome nights.
00:11:32.600,00:11:33.720,可是这些年,00:11:32.600,00:11:34.277,"All these years,"
00:11:35.820,00:11:37.930,我一直将胧月视为我亲生骨肉,00:11:35.820,00:11:38.595,I've always considered Longyue to be my own flesh and blood.
00:11:39.490,00:11:41.320,我从来没有想过你会回来,00:11:39.490,00:11:41.584,I never imagined that you would return...
00:11:41.780,00:11:42.770,你还能回来,00:11:41.780,00:11:43.842,that you could ever come back!
00:11:46.580,00:11:47.570,姐姐可知,00:11:46.580,00:11:48.440,"Estime, did you know that"
00:11:48.490,00:11:49.830,姐姐来往景仁宫之事,,,
00:11:50.210,00:11:51.290,并非我自己探知,00:11:48.490,00:11:51.657,"I did not learn of your visits to the
Palace of Great Benevolence through my own inquiries."
00:11:51.830,00:11:53.540,而是皇后故意透露此事,00:11:51.830,00:11:54.030,This information was deliberately revealed by the Empress.
00:11:54.630,00:11:55.960,若皇后真为姐姐好,00:11:54.630,00:11:56.149,"If she truly wished to support you,"
00:11:56.590,00:11:58.080,自然不会让任何人知晓,00:11:56.590,00:11:58.741,this information would have stayed secret.
00:11:59.050,00:12:01.000,可消息却平白无故地,00:11:59.050,00:12:02.667,"Yet, for seemingly no reason at all,
it was passed on to me."
00:12:01.300,00:12:02.160,传到了我这里,,,
00:12:02.930,00:12:04.130,姐姐细想便是,00:12:02.930,00:12:05.404,You don't need to think hard to understand why.
00:12:07.060,00:12:08.800,皇后是故意让你知道的,00:12:07.060,00:12:08.989,The Empress let you know intentionally.
00:12:09.770,00:12:11.300,她想让我们互相残杀,00:12:09.770,00:12:11.943,She wants us to eliminate each other.
00:12:12.940,00:12:16.300,妹妹请你相信我,00:12:12.940,00:12:16.300,"Lumière, please believe me."
00:12:17.440,00:12:18.770,我不是真的要害你,00:12:17.440,00:12:19.730,It's not that I wanted to hurt you.
00:12:19.730,00:12:20.470,我只是想让胧月,,,
00:12:20.780,00:12:22.440,在我身边再多几年,00:12:19.730,00:12:22.989,"I just wanted Longyue to
stay by my side for a few more years."
00:12:23.360,00:12:24.570,几年而已,00:12:23.360,00:12:24.800,Just a few more years.
00:12:25.660,00:12:26.900,我答应过皇后,00:12:25.660,00:12:27.089,"I told the Empress,"
00:12:27.580,00:12:29.610,只干这一次 唯这一次,00:12:27.580,00:12:30.000,I would do this just once. Only once.
00:12:31.410,00:12:32.570,可是就这样,00:12:31.410,00:12:32.570,"But even so,"
00:12:33.710,00:12:35.740,我还是掉入皇后的股掌之中,00:12:33.710,00:12:35.740,I still fell into her masterful hands.
00:12:37.340,00:12:38.950,无论是借你的手扳倒我,00:12:37.340,00:12:40.590,"Whether it is me bringing you down, or vice versa,"
00:12:39.300,00:12:40.630,还是借我的手扳倒你,,,
00:12:42.050,00:12:46.260,对于皇后而言都是有益无害的,00:12:42.050,00:12:46.260,the Empress benefits either way.
00:12:47.100,00:12:48.680,姐姐未必没有想得周全,00:12:46.978,00:12:49.544,It might not have been your lack of foresight -
00:12:50.010,00:12:53.220,只是为了胧月才不得不冒险行事,00:12:50.010,00:12:53.440,you felt you had to take the risk because of Longyue.
00:12:55.270,00:12:58.850,慈母之心真可叫人盲了眼睛,00:12:55.270,00:13:00.840,A mother's love can truly blind one's eyes and cloud one's mind.
00:12:59.730,00:13:00.690,蒙了心智,,,
00:13:01.650,00:13:04.390,除了你 便是皇后,00:13:01.650,00:13:04.819,"It was either you, or the Empress."
00:13:07.410,00:13:08.610,我没有别的选择,00:13:07.410,00:13:09.040,I had no other choice.
00:13:16.460,00:13:19.120,事已至此 我无话可说,00:13:16.460,00:13:19.120,"At this point, I have nothing more to say."
00:13:20.550,00:13:22.250,悉听贵妃娘娘处置,00:13:20.550,00:13:22.552,I am at the mercy of Your Noble Highness.
00:13:25.630,00:13:29.220,那么就请姐姐替我抚育胧月,00:13:25.630,00:13:27.188,"Then Estime,"
00:13:29.850,00:13:30.930,直至公主出嫁,00:13:28.018,00:13:31.370,please raise Longyue for me until she marries.
,,,00:13:31.810,00:13:32.310,But...
00:13:31.810,00:13:35.800,可 可是胧月是你亲生骨肉,00:13:34.045,00:13:36.253,but Longyue is your own daughter!
00:13:36.440,00:13:37.020,你怎么肯,00:13:36.440,00:13:37.230,Why would you ...
00:13:37.230,00:13:38.930,弘瞻与灵犀已叫我自顾不暇,00:13:37.230,00:13:39.119,Hongyan and Lingxi occupy all the time I have.
00:13:40.860,00:13:43.020,而胧月却视你为生母,00:13:40.860,00:13:43.020,Longyue sees you as her mother.
00:13:43.860,00:13:45.440,我若强行把她养在身边,00:13:43.860,00:13:45.760,"If I force her to live with me,"
00:13:46.070,00:13:46.810,那才是真真断了,,,
00:13:47.160,00:13:48.320,我与她的母女情分,00:13:46.070,00:13:48.800,that would truly break our bond as mother and daughter.
00:13:52.540,00:13:53.900,有妹妹这一句话,00:13:52.540,00:13:53.900,"Hearing you say this,"
00:13:55.000,00:13:56.910,我当拼全力爱护胧月,00:13:55.000,00:13:57.573,I will love and care for Longyue with all my strength.
00:14:00.250,00:14:03.490,姐姐对胧月拼尽全力,00:14:00.250,00:14:03.490,Your wholehearted devotion to Longyue
00:14:04.920,00:14:06.830,即便我这个生母也自叹不如,00:14:04.920,00:14:07.887,makes me incomparable to you despite being her birth mother.
00:14:19.940,00:14:21.430,姐姐能替我抚育胧月,00:14:19.940,00:14:21.883,"By helping me raise Longyue,"
00:14:22.820,00:14:24.900,等于在帮我保全这三个孩子,00:14:22.820,00:14:25.126,you are helping me protect all three of my children.
00:14:27.530,00:14:28.230,谢谢,00:14:27.530,00:14:28.640,Thank you.
00:14:36.910,00:14:40.120,奉天承运 皇帝诏曰,00:14:36.910,00:14:40.520,"By the grace of Heaven, His Majesty decrees:"
00:14:41.040,00:14:42.660,熹妃钮祜禄氏,,,

I hereby grant her the title of Noble Consort Lumière.”"
00:14:51.680,00:14:52.840,钦此,00:14:51.680,00:14:53.440,This is His Majesty’s decree.

00:15:17.500,00:15:20.030,皇上万福金安,00:15:17.500,00:15:21.120,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Rise."
00:15:20.210,00:15:20.820,快起来吧,,,
00:15:21.120,00:15:21.780,谢皇上,00:15:21.120,00:15:22.446,I thank Your Majesty.
00:15:23.630,00:15:24.620,皇上怎么来了,00:15:23.630,00:15:25.000,What brings Your Majesty here?
00:15:25.000,00:15:26.160,朕等不及要见你,00:15:25.000,00:15:26.750,I couldn't wait to see you.
00:15:26.750,00:15:28.240,与其在景仁宫苦等,00:15:26.750,00:15:28.590,"Instead of waiting at the Palace of Great Benevolence,"
00:15:28.590,00:15:29.830,不如和你一起同去,00:15:28.590,00:15:30.470,I would much rather accompany you there.
00:15:30.470,00:15:32.670,今日盛礼愈发不能失了礼数,00:15:30.470,00:15:33.300,"The more magnificent the ceremony,
the more the ceremonial procedures must be followed."
00:15:33.300,00:15:35.710,皇上请上轿辇 臣妾随行就是,00:15:33.300,00:15:36.154,Please ride in the sedan chair. I shall follow Your Majesty.
00:15:36.560,00:15:39.220,嬛嬛时时不忘却辇之德吗,00:15:36.560,00:15:39.576,"Huan Huan, you always remember the
Han Dynasty etiquette of declining the sedan."
00:15:40.180,00:15:42.720,从前不敢忘的如今更不敢忘,00:15:40.180,00:15:43.176,That which I cherish I will never forget.
00:15:43.480,00:15:45.090,当日温泉新浴,,,
00:15:45.610,00:15:47.470,你也是和朕说这般的话,00:15:43.480,00:15:48.153,"You said the same thing to me when we were
leaving for the Hot Spring Palace."
00:15:48.480,00:15:49.390,皇上还记得,00:15:48.480,00:15:50.000,Your Majesty still remembers?
00:15:56.450,00:15:57.820,朕永志不忘,00:15:56.450,00:15:58.400,I shall never forget.
00:16:02.120,00:16:03.990,熹贵妃钮祜禄氏,00:16:02.120,00:16:04.103,Noble Consort Lumière of the Niohuru family.
00:16:04.290,00:16:06.330,得天所授承兆内闱,00:16:04.290,00:16:06.330,"By the grace of Heaven's decree to the palace,"
00:16:06.920,00:16:10.210,望今后修德自恃和睦宫闱,00:16:06.920,00:16:10.210,may you cultivate virtue and bring peace to the imperial harem.
00:16:10.380,00:16:12.920,勤谨奉上绵延后嗣,00:16:10.380,00:16:13.053,"May you diligently serve His Majesty and
expand the imperial family."
00:16:14.180,00:16:16.630,承教于皇后不胜欣喜,00:16:14.180,00:16:17.030,I am delighted to obey Your Majesty's advice.
00:16:33.740,00:16:38.610,熹贵妃聪颖明慧善识大体,00:16:33.740,00:16:39.040,"Noble Consort Lumière has a brilliant intellect
and a perceptive mind."
00:16:39.990,00:16:42.780,皇后的身子一直不大好,00:16:39.990,00:16:43.135,"Since you have not been in very good health,"
00:16:43.830,00:16:45.540,也该好好将息,00:16:43.830,00:16:45.920,you should take some time to recuperate.
00:16:46.250,00:16:48.580,朕打算将协理六宫之权,00:16:46.250,00:16:50.400,"I plan to give Noble Consort Lumière the authority
to assist in palace management."
00:16:48.960,00:16:49.920,交与熹贵妃,,,
00:16:50.760,00:16:53.210,宫中琐事皆由她来打理,00:16:50.760,00:16:53.470,She will take care of all the trivial matters in the palace.
00:16:53.470,00:16:54.300,皇后以为如何,00:16:53.470,00:16:54.890,What are your thoughts on this?
00:16:54.840,00:16:56.080,那自然是好的,,,
00:16:56.390,00:16:58.720,只是臣妾虽然身体有些不适,00:16:54.890,00:16:59.175,"It is certainly a good thing.
But although I have not been feeling well,"
00:16:59.100,00:17:01.590,可熹贵妃也要照料一双儿女,00:16:59.200,00:17:01.847,Noble Consort Lumière has to take care of her newborns
00:17:01.970,00:17:03.310,不日胧月公主,,,
00:17:03.640,00:17:05.130,也要接到永寿宫抚养,00:17:02.073,00:17:05.130,"and soon Princess Longyue will return
to the Palace of Eternal Longevity."
00:17:05.900,00:17:08.480,只怕熹贵妃会忙不过来,00:17:05.900,00:17:08.810,"I'm concerned that Noble Consort Lumière
won't have time to manage everything,"
00:17:08.810,00:17:09.930,百上加斤,00:17:08.810,00:17:10.614,with such additional burden on her responsibilities.
00:17:10.780,00:17:12.690,朕和熹贵妃商量过了,00:17:10.780,00:17:12.956,I've already discussed this with Noble Consort Lumière.
00:17:13.360,00:17:17.400,觉得胧月由敬妃抚养甚好,00:17:13.360,00:17:17.780,"We have agreed it would be best for Consort Estime
to continue raising Longyue."
00:17:17.780,00:17:18.770,不必再挪动了,00:17:17.780,00:17:19.409,There is no need to move her away.
00:17:19.620,00:17:23.410,弘瞻和灵犀就由乳母照料,00:17:19.620,00:17:23.750,"As for Hongyan and Lingxi, their nursemaids take care of them."
00:17:23.750,00:17:25.740,熹贵妃费不了多少功夫,00:17:23.750,00:17:26.348,Noble Consort Lumière won't have much to attend to.
00:17:26.830,00:17:28.790,倒是臣妾多虑了,00:17:26.830,00:17:29.320,It seems like my concerns were unnecessary.
00:17:29.630,00:17:33.290,只不过熹贵妃头次料理后宫之事,00:17:29.630,00:17:33.290,"But this is the first time that Noble Consort Lumière
would be managing palace affairs."
00:17:33.800,00:17:37.130,这些事说多不多 说小也不小,00:17:33.800,00:17:37.130,These matters may seem trivial but are numerous.
00:17:37.510,00:17:39.880,不免有些吃力不如,00:17:37.510,00:17:39.794,"To help ease the burden, how about..."
00:17:40.180,00:17:41.390,皇后娘娘所言极是,00:17:39.794,00:17:41.967,Your Majesty is right.
00:17:42.430,00:17:43.720,臣妾到底年轻,,,
00:17:44.100,00:17:45.760,不如诸位姐姐阅历丰富,00:17:42.430,00:17:46.029,"Compared to the concubines senior to me,
I am young and inexperienced."
00:17:47.020,00:17:48.480,端妃姐姐最早入宫,00:17:47.020,00:17:49.242,"Consort Honnête entered the family the earliest,"
00:17:48.940,00:17:50.770,敬妃姐姐曾协助皇后,00:17:49.242,00:17:52.520,"and Consort Estime assisted Your Majesty
with palace affairs for many years."
00:17:51.150,00:17:52.010,料理后宫多年,,,
00:17:52.610,00:17:56.150,臣妾很愿意向两位姐姐讨教问询,00:17:52.610,00:17:56.505,I am more than willing to ask them for advice.
00:17:56.990,00:17:59.820,你肯如此想就最好了,00:17:56.990,00:18:00.530,It's wonderful that you feel that way.
00:18:01.450,00:18:04.610,皇后还有什么要叮嘱熹贵妃的吗,00:18:01.450,00:18:04.921,"Do you have any more advice for
Noble Consort Lumière?"
00:18:06.410,00:18:09.280,熹贵妃以后你是妃嫔之首,00:18:06.410,00:18:09.413,"Noble Consort Lumière,
now that you are the head of concubines,"
00:18:09.790,00:18:11.780,既要勤勉于宫闱之事,00:18:09.790,00:18:12.006,you must be diligent in managing the palace affairs
00:18:12.340,00:18:14.170,也要好好地侍奉皇上,,,
00:18:14.670,00:18:17.040,给皇上再添几位皇子,00:18:12.340,00:18:17.411,"as well as serving His Majesty to
add a few more heirs to the imperial family."
00:18:17.930,00:18:19.540,臣妾是皇后一手调教,00:18:17.930,00:18:20.000,Your Majesty has personally educated me.
00:18:20.340,00:18:22.050,绝不辜负皇后期望,00:18:20.340,00:18:22.494,I will not disappoint Your Majesty's expectations.
00:18:24.640,00:18:26.970,跪久了膝盖疼快起来吧,00:18:24.640,00:18:27.281,"Your knees will hurt from kneeling for too long.
You may rise."
00:18:27.480,00:18:28.260,谢皇上,00:18:27.480,00:18:28.646,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:34.860,00:18:37.020,好好地用你的熹贵妃金宝,00:18:34.860,00:18:37.020,Make good use of your golden seal.
00:18:37.650,00:18:39.640,如今它可不是一块,00:18:37.650,00:18:41.730,It's no longer just a cold block of gold.
00:18:40.110,00:18:41.730,冷冰冰的金疙瘩了,,,
00:18:46.000,00:18:47.450,臣妾要去更衣,00:18:46.000,00:18:47.790,"Your Majesty, I'm going to get changed."
00:18:47.790,00:18:49.400,就请皇上和熹贵妃,00:18:47.790,00:18:51.207,"May I ask Your Majesty and Noble Consort Lumière
to go ahead to the Palace of Layered Brilliance"
00:18:49.620,00:18:52.330,先去重华宫接受妃嫔叩拜吧,00:18:51.207,00:18:53.032,to accept the ceremonial respects from the concubines?
00:18:56.760,00:19:00.290,郎情似酒热妾谊如丝柔,00:18:56.760,00:19:00.510,"""A man's passion is strong as warm liquor;
a woman's affection is soft as tender silk."""
00:19:00.760,00:19:05.350,酒热有时冷丝柔无断绝,00:19:00.760,00:19:05.350,"""The heated liquor can grow cold,
 but the tender silk is never severed."""
00:19:06.390,00:19:08.850,臣妾但愿皇上待熹贵妃之心,00:19:06.390,00:19:10.890,"My wish is that Your Majesty will treat
Noble Consort Lumière like that unsevered silk."
00:19:09.190,00:19:10.890,亦如丝柔无断绝,,,
00:19:11.560,00:19:13.850,且请皇上饮尽此杯,00:19:11.560,00:19:13.850,"Please drink up, Your Majesty."
00:19:15.650,00:19:16.230,好,00:19:15.650,00:19:16.960,Well said!
00:19:27.870,00:19:29.700,恭贺熹贵妃,00:19:27.870,00:19:30.000,Congratulations to Noble Consort Lumière.
00:19:31.080,00:19:32.740,恭贺熹贵妃,00:19:31.080,00:19:32.966,Congratulations to Noble Consort Lumière.
00:19:40.220,00:19:41.050,都坐下吧,00:19:40.220,00:19:41.420,All may be seated.
00:19:44.720,00:19:46.590,朕今晚去你宫里,00:19:44.720,00:19:46.816,I'll join you in your palace tonight.
00:19:47.890,00:19:49.510,今日是弘瞻 灵犀满月,00:19:47.890,00:19:49.890,"Today is the one-month anniversary
of Hongyan and Lingxi's birth."
00:19:49.890,00:19:52.050,臣妾怕胧月这个做姐姐的会吃醋,00:19:49.890,00:19:52.471,I am afraid their older sister Longyue will be jealous.
00:19:52.900,00:19:54.310,不如皇上替臣妾,,,
00:19:54.650,00:19:56.100,去敬妃姐姐宫里陪胧月,00:19:52.900,00:19:56.610,"Why doesn't Your Majesty spend some time with Longyue
in Consort Estime's palace on my behalf?"
00:19:56.610,00:19:57.970,胧月一定高兴,00:19:56.610,00:19:58.234,Longyue will definitely feel happy.
00:19:58.610,00:19:59.220,也好,00:19:58.610,00:19:59.880,Just as well.
00:20:00.240,00:20:02.730,总不能叫胧月觉得有了弟妹,00:20:00.240,00:20:04.223,"I can't let Longyue feel like I'm neglecting her
now that she has a little brother and sister."
00:20:03.070,00:20:04.110,朕就冷落了她,,,
00:20:17.750,00:20:18.830,给小主润润手,,,
00:20:19.210,00:20:20.370,这是上好的玫瑰汁子,00:20:17.750,00:20:20.920,"My Lady, this is for you to nourish your hands.
It is top-quality rose water."
00:20:20.920,00:20:22.500,用完之后手又香又嫩,00:20:20.920,00:20:22.726,Your hands will become fragrant and soft.
00:20:24.680,00:20:25.790,弘瞻和灵犀呢,00:20:24.937,00:20:26.346,Where are Hongyan and Lingxi?
00:20:26.850,00:20:27.880,乳母抱去喂奶了,00:20:26.850,00:20:28.265,The nursemaids are nursing them.
00:20:29.600,00:20:31.930,娘娘这贺礼实在是太多了,00:20:29.600,00:20:32.160,"Your Highness, there are so many congratulatory gifts."
00:20:32.230,00:20:33.810,一时半会儿还真挑不出来,00:20:32.230,00:20:33.920,I need more time to sort through all of them.
00:20:35.350,00:20:36.180,你眼光好,00:20:35.350,00:20:36.369,You have good taste.
00:20:36.520,00:20:38.060,只挑你看得上眼的告诉我,00:20:36.520,00:20:38.286,Only tell me about those that capture your eyes.
00:20:38.860,00:20:40.310,这晋康郡王府送来的,00:20:38.860,00:20:40.499,This is from State Prince Jinkang.
00:20:40.860,00:20:42.270,是一副十二把的,,,
00:20:42.570,00:20:44.480,泥金真丝绡麋竹扇,00:20:40.860,00:20:44.480,"It is a set of a dozen fans made of
gold-painted silk voile, antler, and bamboo."
00:20:44.950,00:20:47.110,奇就奇在那竹骨触手生凉,00:20:44.950,00:20:47.110,"The most marvelous thing is that the bamboo feels so cool on your hands,"
00:20:47.490,00:20:48.200,跟玉似的,00:20:47.110,00:20:48.538,just like jade.
00:20:49.580,00:20:50.440,还有这个,00:20:49.580,00:20:50.740,And there's this.
00:20:51.120,00:20:54.990,沛国公府送来的文犀辟毒筷,00:20:51.120,00:20:54.990,"The Duke of Pei gifted poison-detecting chopsticks
made of grooved rhinoceros horn."
00:20:55.750,00:20:57.370,虽说银筷也能测毒,00:20:55.750,00:20:57.840,"Although silver chopsticks can also detect poison,"
00:20:57.840,00:20:59.120,可远没有这个稀罕,00:20:57.840,00:20:59.535,they are far less precious than these.
00:20:59.750,00:21:02.210,用毒之人最狠毒无比防不胜防,00:20:59.750,00:21:03.304,"People who use poison are the most insidious.
You can never be too vigilant."
00:21:03.840,00:21:05.460,到底是沛国公有心思,00:21:03.840,00:21:05.875,The Duke of Pei is thoughtful to offer these.
00:21:08.180,00:21:09.460,可是沛国公孟家,00:21:08.180,00:21:10.000,Is it the Duke of Pei from the Meng family?
00:21:10.100,00:21:10.880,是啊,00:21:10.040,00:21:11.080,Yes.
00:21:13.270,00:21:14.800,他家的小姐孟静娴,00:21:13.270,00:21:15.288,"His daughter, Meng Jingxian,"
00:21:15.770,00:21:17.510,原是要指给十七爷的那一位,00:21:15.770,00:21:17.510,was to be betrothed to Lord XVII.
00:21:18.770,00:21:19.850,也不知出嫁了没有,00:21:18.770,00:21:20.227,I wonder if she is married already.
00:21:20.860,00:21:21.600,还没呢,00:21:20.860,00:21:21.900,Not yet.
00:21:21.900,00:21:23.640,孟小姐一心思慕十七爷,00:21:21.900,00:21:23.640,Miss Meng admires Lord XVII wholeheartedly.
00:21:23.940,00:21:26.530,至今都不愿出阁 都成老姑娘了,00:21:23.940,00:21:26.719,"She still ""hasn't stepped out of her maiden's chamber.""
Now she is an old maid."
00:21:27.410,00:21:28.610,以为等成老姑娘,,,
00:21:28.820,00:21:30.160,便能嫁与十七爷了吗,00:21:27.410,00:21:30.160,"Does she think she can marry Lord XVII
by waiting until she's old?"
00:21:31.160,00:21:32.950,天下仰慕王爷的女子那么多,00:21:31.160,00:21:33.252,His Lordship has so many admirers.
00:21:33.580,00:21:35.700,恐怕王爷连她的眉毛鼻子,00:21:33.580,00:21:36.950,I bet His Lordship has never even looked at her brows and eyes.
00:21:36.040,00:21:36.950,都没看清过吧,,,
00:21:37.330,00:21:38.570,你何必动这么大的气,00:21:37.330,00:21:39.084,Why are you so angry?
00:21:39.340,00:21:40.700,说话也忒刻薄了,00:21:39.340,00:21:41.257,Your remarks are so callous.
00:21:42.250,00:21:43.840,奴婢就是看不惯她这副样子,00:21:42.250,00:21:44.066,I just can't stand the way she is.
00:21:44.420,00:21:45.210,生怕别人不知道,,,
00:21:45.550,00:21:46.580,她等着十七爷似的,00:21:44.420,00:21:46.880,"She's scared there might be people who
don't know she is waiting for him."
00:21:47.050,00:21:47.920,叫王爷难堪,00:21:47.050,00:21:48.349,It embarrasses His Lordship.
00:21:50.180,00:21:52.300,这贺礼送来送去就这些东西,00:21:50.180,00:21:52.300,The gifts are all about the same.
00:21:53.270,00:21:54.760,把那些寻常玩意儿收起来,00:21:53.270,00:21:55.779,"Put away the common ones
so we can reward them to others."
00:21:54.980,00:21:55.630,留着赏人,,,
00:21:55.940,00:21:56.770,别的也就算了,00:21:55.940,00:21:57.402,The other gifts are not worth mentioning.
00:21:57.100,00:21:59.430,这果郡王府送来的珊瑚手钏,,,
00:21:59.770,00:22:01.980,奴婢瞧着真是精致得不得了,00:21:57.402,00:22:01.980,"In my eyes, this coral bracelet from
Noble Prince Guo is most exquisite."
00:22:08.700,00:22:10.440,掌上珊瑚怜不得,,,
00:22:11.410,00:22:13.270,却教移作上阳花,00:22:08.700,00:22:14.040,"""Coral is not to be cherished in the palm of your hand;
It is to be enshrined as a flower in the Shangyang Palace."""
00:22:17.750,00:22:18.530,小主,00:22:17.750,00:22:18.830,My Lady.
00:22:18.830,00:22:21.040,左右皇上今晚宿在敬妃那儿,00:22:18.830,00:22:21.040,His Majesty will stay with Consort Estime tonight.
00:22:22.380,00:22:23.790,眉姐姐身子不舒服,00:22:22.380,00:22:23.790,Meizhuang is not feeling well.
00:22:24.340,00:22:25.370,咱们去看看她吧,00:22:24.340,00:22:25.634,We shall go visit her.

00:22:36.390,00:22:37.300,熹贵妃吉祥,00:22:36.390,00:22:37.850,Peace to Noble Consort Lumière.
00:22:37.850,00:22:38.470,停轿,00:22:37.850,00:22:38.899,Stop the litter.
00:22:46.530,00:22:47.480,甯贵人同安,00:22:46.530,00:22:48.310,"Peace to you as well, Noble Lady Paix."
00:22:49.410,00:22:51.940,贵人好雅兴出来散心呢,00:22:49.410,00:22:52.280,I see you are out enjoying the pleasant night.
00:22:53.700,00:22:54.570,出来逛一逛,00:22:53.700,00:22:55.304,I'm just taking a short walk.
00:22:55.040,00:22:57.150,等下回去抱我的团绒休息便了,00:22:55.304,00:22:57.150,I shall return shortly to cuddle with Velvet Ball and sleep.
00:22:58.210,00:22:59.660,贵人的团绒极是可爱,00:22:58.210,00:23:00.188,Velvet Ball is such an adorable cat.
00:23:00.920,00:23:02.280,不知长大了些没有,00:23:00.920,00:23:02.710,I'm wondering if she's grown larger.
00:23:02.710,00:23:03.670,娘娘若有兴致,00:23:02.710,00:23:04.040,"If Your Highness is interested,"
00:23:04.040,00:23:06.160,不如移步去嫔妾的春禧殿坐坐,00:23:04.040,00:23:06.160,why not stop by my Hall of Spring Joy?
00:23:07.260,00:23:08.750,不知娘娘肯不肯赏脸,00:23:07.260,00:23:09.693,I wonder if Your Highness will deign to grace my humble abode?
00:23:10.010,00:23:12.800,但娘娘动辄无数人跟着,00:23:10.010,00:23:13.064,"However, Your Highness is attended by so many servants;"
00:23:13.970,00:23:15.130,只怕把嫔妾的团绒,,,
00:23:15.470,00:23:16.430,给吓得不敢吭声了,00:23:13.970,00:23:17.280,I'm afraid they will frighten my Velvet Ball into silence.
00:23:17.520,00:23:18.350,娘娘知道,00:23:17.520,00:23:19.244,As Your Highness knows
00:23:18.980,00:23:21.260,团绒最妙的便是它的叫声,00:23:19.244,00:23:21.760,the best thing about Velvet Ball is her meow.
00:23:23.980,00:23:25.310,今晚夜色如醉,00:23:23.980,00:23:25.980,"Under this intoxicating moonlight,"
00:23:25.980,00:23:28.570,若不趁兴同游当真是辜负了,00:23:25.980,00:23:28.570,it would be a shame if I do not join you.
00:23:29.780,00:23:30.890,浣碧来扶我,00:23:29.780,00:23:31.608,"Jade, help me up."
00:23:36.290,00:23:37.490,难得贵人相邀,00:23:36.290,00:23:38.207,It is quite rare to receive your invitation.
00:23:38.830,00:23:41.410,那本宫就去贵人处坐坐吧,00:23:38.830,00:23:41.410,I shall pay a visit to your residence.
00:23:43.290,00:23:44.330,你们都不许跟着,00:23:43.290,00:23:44.872,You all don't need to follow us.
00:23:53.180,00:23:53.880,你要干什么,00:23:53.180,00:23:54.410,What do you want?
00:23:55.140,00:23:56.880,娘娘别小瞧这把匕首,00:23:55.140,00:23:57.266,"Do not underestimate this dagger, Your Highness."
00:23:57.770,00:23:58.470,嫔妾曾被,,,
00:23:58.850,00:24:00.430,一只不知好歹的豹子所伤,00:23:57.455,00:24:00.751,I was attacked by a reckless leopard once.
00:24:00.940,00:24:03.390,嫔妾便偷偷潜入那豹苑,00:24:00.940,00:24:03.390,"I then sneaked into its cave,"
00:24:03.900,00:24:05.390,割断那豹子的喉管,00:24:03.390,00:24:05.390,and slit its throat.
00:24:05.980,00:24:07.810,碧姑娘若不小心叫出来,00:24:05.980,00:24:07.810,"If Jade finds herself screaming,"
00:24:08.940,00:24:10.230,嫔妾手中的匕首,00:24:08.940,00:24:11.030,then this very dagger
00:24:11.030,00:24:13.190,也会不小心割断熹贵妃的喉咙,00:24:11.030,00:24:13.490,may find itself slitting Consort Lumière's throat.
00:24:14.110,00:24:15.230,何必吓唬浣碧,00:24:14.110,00:24:15.815,There is no need to terrify Jade.
00:24:16.830,00:24:18.110,你把本宫骗到此处,00:24:16.830,00:24:18.110,You lured me here
00:24:19.240,00:24:20.320,又许浣碧跟着,00:24:19.240,00:24:20.433,and allowed Jade to accompany us.
00:24:21.580,00:24:22.870,自然是有万全之策,00:24:21.580,00:24:23.342,You must have a thorough plan.
00:24:24.920,00:24:26.030,娘娘好聪明,00:24:24.920,00:24:26.030,"Brilliant, Your Highness."
00:24:26.960,00:24:29.000,所以嫔妾即使在这里,00:24:26.960,00:24:31.144,"If I lose all constraint and kill Your Highness and your servant,"
00:24:29.250,00:24:31.090,失手杀了娘娘和您的侍女,,,
00:24:32.220,00:24:33.580,前头便是交芦馆,00:24:32.220,00:24:34.390,the Pavilion of Twining Reeds is right up ahead -
00:24:34.390,00:24:36.500,我大可推到祺贵人身上,00:24:34.390,00:24:36.915,I can easily turn Lady Délice into my scapegoat.
00:24:38.220,00:24:40.300,反正祺贵人想杀娘娘的心,00:24:38.220,00:24:42.074,"After all, it's not just recently
she developed the desire to kill Your Highness."
00:24:40.640,00:24:41.630,不是一日两日了,,,
00:24:42.600,00:24:44.930,嫔妾大可成全她,00:24:42.600,00:24:45.119,I might as well grant her this wish.
00:24:47.270,00:24:48.510,难道富贵人与本宫,00:24:47.270,00:24:50.000,Don't you also harbor hatred against me?
00:24:48.860,00:24:49.770,不是结怨已久吗,,,
00:24:51.740,00:24:54.770,否则何必让团绒引来那么多猫,00:24:51.740,00:24:54.883,"Otherwise, why would you allow Velvet Ball
to attract so many cats,"
00:24:55.530,00:24:57.570,来要本宫和腹中孩儿的性命,00:24:55.530,00:24:58.342,trying to take my life and the lives of my children?
00:24:58.580,00:25:00.440,既然娘娘一早猜到,00:24:58.580,00:25:00.629,"Your Highness was aware of that,"
00:25:01.950,00:25:03.790,还能隐忍嫔妾这么久了,00:25:01.950,00:25:04.433,yet you tolerated me for so long.
00:25:05.000,00:25:06.990,本宫也不想为难你一片痴心,00:25:05.000,00:25:07.782,I didn't want to give you trouble over your devoted love.
00:25:08.880,00:25:10.120,你已是皇上的宠妃,00:25:08.880,00:25:10.849,But now you are a favored concubine of His Majesty.
00:25:11.760,00:25:13.290,若因果郡王而杀了本宫,00:25:11.760,00:25:13.554,It's not worthwhile to kill me
00:25:15.050,00:25:15.960,未免太不值了,00:25:15.050,00:25:16.835,for the sake of Noble Prince Guo.
00:25:18.260,00:25:19.050,你知道了,00:25:18.260,00:25:19.822,So you knew.
00:25:21.850,00:25:24.010,贵人爱合欢花逾越自己的性命,00:25:21.850,00:25:25.000,"You love the ""coupling joy"" flowers more than your own life."
00:25:25.310,00:25:26.520,且有人告诉本宫,00:25:25.310,00:25:26.822,Someone also told me that
00:25:28.060,00:25:29.800,昔年你孤苦垂死之际,00:25:28.060,00:25:30.533,Noble Prince Guo sent an imperial doctor to save you
00:25:30.690,00:25:32.180,是他请了太医来救你,00:25:30.690,00:25:33.509,when you were alone and on the brink of death years ago.
00:25:34.820,00:25:36.980,可他若知道自己救了个蛇蝎女子,00:25:34.820,00:25:37.796,I wonder what he will think if he finds out he saved a woman
00:25:38.200,00:25:39.360,不知会作何感想,00:25:38.200,00:25:40.000,"""as vicious as the snakes and scorpions""."
00:25:40.530,00:25:41.690,难为王爷昔日救你,00:25:40.530,00:25:42.542,"His Lordship made a great effort to save your life,"
00:25:42.370,00:25:43.320,你竟如此狠毒,00:25:42.542,00:25:44.028,but you are so vile!
00:25:44.290,00:25:45.400,你也配喜欢王爷吗,00:25:44.290,00:25:46.269,Are you even worthy to admire His Lordship?
00:25:47.250,00:25:49.330,怎么方才你家小主说我害她之时,00:25:47.250,00:25:50.673,"You weren't angry when your mistress said I harmed her,"
00:25:49.630,00:25:50.370,你不曾激怒,,,
00:25:51.050,00:25:53.040,说起王爷你便如此情急呀,00:25:51.050,00:25:53.260,why become agitated when His Lordship is mentioned?
00:25:53.260,00:25:53.910,你,00:25:53.260,00:25:54.136,You!
00:25:55.340,00:25:56.050,妖孽,00:25:55.340,00:25:56.630,You demoness!
00:25:56.630,00:25:57.540,我是妖孽,00:25:56.630,00:25:58.030,"If I am a demoness,"
00:25:58.470,00:26:00.710,那熹贵妃岂不成了妖孽之首了,00:25:58.470,00:26:01.460,"does that not make Noble Consort Lumière
the head of all demons?"
00:26:02.220,00:26:03.680,既有甘露寺的缘分,00:26:02.220,00:26:04.020,Your fate led you to be with him -
00:26:04.020,00:26:05.010,何必得陇望蜀,00:26:04.020,00:26:05.390,but you were insatiable.
00:26:05.390,00:26:06.930,施媚重回皇上身边,00:26:05.390,00:26:07.270,You bewitched the Emperor and returned.
00:26:07.690,00:26:08.770,难道在娘娘心中,00:26:07.690,00:26:08.960,"In Your Highness's heart,"
00:26:09.400,00:26:11.060,天家富贵就真的胜过于,,,
00:26:11.440,00:26:12.600,王爷的一片倾心吗,00:26:09.000,00:26:13.743,"does the imperial status and opulence really surpass
His Lordship's love and devotion?"
00:26:14.030,00:26:15.140,我自认识王爷,00:26:14.030,00:26:15.517,"Ever since I met His Lordship,"
00:26:15.820,00:26:16.810,只知他是天底下,,,
00:26:17.150,00:26:18.560,最英勇潇洒的男子,00:26:15.820,00:26:19.074,"I've only known that he's the most
gallant and free-spirited man under Heaven."
00:26:19.620,00:26:22.780,从未见他如此受挫潦倒憔悴,00:26:19.620,00:26:23.209,"I've never seen him so frustrated, dispirited, and haggard."
00:26:24.160,00:26:25.620,娘娘自回宫那时起,00:26:24.160,00:26:25.920,My suspicions were aroused
00:26:26.870,00:26:27.830,我就开始疑心,00:26:26.870,00:26:28.873,the moment Your Highness returned to the Palace.
00:26:29.580,00:26:31.490,直到那一日中秋家宴,00:26:29.580,00:26:32.180,And at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet...
00:26:34.710,00:26:36.080,那日偷听的人是你,00:26:34.710,00:26:37.113,You were the one eavesdropping that night.
00:26:38.590,00:26:39.420,是我又怎样,00:26:38.590,00:26:40.000,And what of it?
00:26:40.260,00:26:42.090,你觉得我不配喜欢王爷对吗,00:26:40.260,00:26:42.824,Do you think I am unworthy to admire His Lordship?
00:26:43.140,00:26:44.590,但你熹贵妃更不配,00:26:43.140,00:26:45.836,"But you, Noble Consort Lumière, are even less worthy of him!"
00:26:46.180,00:26:47.260,我若杀了你,00:26:46.180,00:26:47.680,"If I kill you,"
00:26:48.310,00:26:49.170,只是这天底下,,,
00:26:49.440,00:26:51.180,又少了一个负心的人罢了,00:26:48.310,00:26:51.730,it will just remove one more heartless woman from this world.
00:26:51.730,00:26:53.440,我家小主要是有什么差池的话,00:26:51.730,00:26:54.087,You will also be taking His Lordship's life
00:26:54.270,00:26:55.510,你便是要了王爷的命,00:26:54.270,00:26:55.940,if anything happens to My Lady.
00:26:55.940,00:26:58.400,这些年来只有王爷对我最好,00:26:55.940,00:26:58.626,"All these years, only His Lordship has treated me well."
00:26:59.360,00:27:01.900,所以一切让他伤心的人都该死,00:26:59.360,00:27:02.089,"Therefore, anyone who hurts him deserves to die."
00:27:02.410,00:27:05.990,你若不容我只怕也伤了他,00:27:02.410,00:27:06.376,"If you don't spare me, you will harm him as well."
00:27:07.040,00:27:08.070,不是我不容你,00:27:07.040,00:27:09.058,It's not that I don't want to spare you.
00:27:09.410,00:27:11.330,是天下不容负心之人,00:27:09.410,00:27:11.630,"It's just that there is no place
for unfaithful people under Heaven."
00:27:12.250,00:27:13.080,你可怎知,00:27:12.250,00:27:13.922,How would you know...
00:27:15.300,00:27:18.130,有时这负比不负要艰辛多了,00:27:15.300,00:27:18.473,"Sometimes, unfaithfulness is its own punishment."
00:27:21.470,00:27:23.210,哪儿来的这是哪儿来的,00:27:21.470,00:27:23.982,Where...? Where did you get this?
00:27:25.350,00:27:27.550,这珊瑚手钏曾是数年前,00:27:25.350,00:27:27.550,This coral bracelet is from the South Sea;
00:27:28.060,00:27:29.890,王爷从南海求得的心爱之物,00:27:28.060,00:27:30.189,it was His Lordship's prized possession.
00:27:30.890,00:27:31.720,从不示人,00:27:30.890,00:27:32.350,He has never shown it to anyone.
00:27:32.350,00:27:33.180,为何到你手上,00:27:32.350,00:27:33.674,Why do you have this?
00:27:33.980,00:27:37.140,这话你应该问这手钏的主人,00:27:33.980,00:27:37.869,You should ask the owner of this bracelet.
,,,00:27:40.070,00:27:41.320,Your Lordship...
00:27:40.070,00:27:43.730,王爷你又不欠她的,00:27:42.640,00:27:44.409,You owe her nothing.
00:27:44.780,00:27:46.400,为什么对她如此放不下,00:27:44.780,00:27:46.872,Why are you unable to move on?
00:27:50.250,00:27:50.860,罢了,00:27:50.259,00:27:51.483,Forget it.
00:27:52.250,00:27:53.860,王爷既然把心都掏给了你,00:27:52.250,00:27:54.124,His Lordship gave you his heart.
00:27:54.750,00:27:56.040,你若还有稍许良心,00:27:54.750,00:27:56.640,If you have any sense of conscience at all
00:27:56.960,00:27:57.870,就该日日自责,00:27:56.960,00:27:58.943,you should condemn yourself every day.
00:28:00.130,00:28:01.500,王爷对我的那点好,00:28:00.130,00:28:02.550,The kind treatment I received from His Lordship
00:28:02.550,00:28:05.460,在你看来或许根本不算什么,00:28:02.550,00:28:05.460,might be absolutely nothing in your eyes.
00:28:07.600,00:28:08.460,但于我,00:28:07.600,00:28:09.125,"However, to me ..."
00:28:09.680,00:28:11.920,已是这毕生不可得的温暖,00:28:09.680,00:28:12.637,it is warmth I will never again embrace in my life.
00:28:14.190,00:28:15.520,我今日就放你走,00:28:14.190,00:28:16.000,I'm letting you go today
00:28:17.070,00:28:18.980,就算报答王爷昔年之恩吧,00:28:17.070,00:28:19.282,to repay His Lordship's kindness to me.
00:28:22.910,00:28:23.740,真是个疯子,00:28:22.910,00:28:24.426,What a lunatic!
,,,00:28:24.820,00:28:26.300,No harm was done.
00:28:24.820,00:28:30.860,罢了 甯贵人也是至情至性之人,00:28:26.905,00:28:31.160,Lady Paix went to extremes for her passion and emotions.
00:28:34.290,00:28:36.250,熹贵妃真是好福气呀,00:28:34.290,00:28:36.250,Noble Consort Lumière has great good fortune indeed.
00:28:36.590,00:28:38.670,一对龙凤胎算是保了她,00:28:36.590,00:28:38.670,"The ""dragon and phoenix twins"" have secured"
00:28:39.050,00:28:40.250,一世的荣华富贵,00:28:38.670,00:28:40.514,her a lifetime of honor and riches.
00:28:40.670,00:28:41.960,生下来算什么本事,00:28:40.670,00:28:42.380,Just giving birth is nothing to be proud of.
00:28:42.380,00:28:43.540,养得大才算本事,00:28:42.380,00:28:44.550,We'll see if she is capable of bringing them up.
00:28:44.550,00:28:47.090,祺妹妹这话说得好轻巧,00:28:44.701,00:28:47.241,"Easy for you to say that, Délice."
00:28:47.800,00:28:48.920,当然轻巧了,00:28:47.800,00:28:48.920,Certainly.
00:28:49.310,00:28:50.340,安嫔姐姐不祥,00:28:49.310,00:28:50.930,"An, you are of ill omen."
00:28:50.930,00:28:52.590,惠嫔怀着胎都忌讳着您,00:28:50.930,00:28:53.190,Even Concubine Vertu avoids you while she's pregnant.
00:28:53.190,00:28:55.520,要是有您去熹贵妃宫里多晃晃,00:28:53.190,00:28:55.940,"If you walk around Noble Consort Lumière's palace more often,"
00:28:55.940,00:28:57.970,熹贵妃的孩子还活得了吗,00:28:55.940,00:28:58.008,I wonder if her children can stay alive.
00:28:58.190,00:28:58.850,都闭嘴,00:28:58.190,00:28:59.407,"Silence, both of you!"
00:29:00.570,00:29:02.100,一个一个嘴上功夫了得,00:29:00.570,00:29:02.440,Both of you are so good with words
00:29:02.440,00:29:03.230,却哄不住皇上,00:29:02.440,00:29:04.535,but cannot talk yourselves into His Majesty's favor.
00:29:04.950,00:29:07.910,祺贵人你解了禁足后,00:29:04.950,00:29:08.160,"Noble Lady Délice, since you were released from confinement"
00:29:08.160,00:29:09.610,却再不得皇上的宠爱,00:29:08.160,00:29:10.000,"you haven't been able to restore
His Majesty's favor for you."
00:29:10.700,00:29:14.290,安嫔你被天象所困那么久,00:29:10.700,00:29:15.080,"Concubine An, you've been trapped by
 this astrological situation for so long"
00:29:14.540,00:29:16.120,却毫无自救之力,00:29:15.080,00:29:16.995,and have shown no ability to save yourself.
00:29:18.340,00:29:20.250,一个一个帮不了本宫,00:29:18.340,00:29:21.670,"Neither of you can make yourself helpful to me.
All you do is bicker."
00:29:20.590,00:29:21.370,还要起内讧,,,
00:29:21.670,00:29:22.830,要你们什么用,00:29:21.670,00:29:23.516,What's the use of you two?
00:29:26.800,00:29:28.010,好好用些心吧,00:29:26.800,00:29:28.720,Use your wits well.
00:29:28.720,00:29:30.760,否则这后宫便是她甄环的了,00:29:28.720,00:29:31.189,"Otherwise, this whole harem will be taken by Zhen Huan!"
00:29:34.180,00:29:36.390,贱货跟我争高低,00:29:34.180,00:29:36.390,That bitch! She dared compete with me!
00:29:40.190,00:29:42.850,安嫔你这样卑微的身份,00:29:40.190,00:29:43.400,"Concubine An, you come from such lowly beginnings"
00:29:43.400,00:29:45.230,跟我平起平坐那么久,00:29:43.400,00:29:45.928,yet you've been on equal footing with me for so long.
00:29:47.200,00:29:49.230,我也算是忍够了,00:29:47.200,00:29:49.381,I've tolerated you enough.
00:29:54.160,00:29:56.030,小主安神汤炖好了,00:29:54.160,00:29:56.290,"My Lady, your sleep tonic is ready."
00:29:56.290,00:29:57.030,您喝了睡吧,00:29:56.290,00:29:58.091,Drink it before you retire to bed.
00:30:19.400,00:30:23.510,宝鹃 宝鹃,00:30:19.400,00:30:20.887,Coua...
,,,00:30:22.924,00:30:24.151,Coua!
00:30:25.900,00:30:26.640,宝鹃,00:30:25.900,00:30:27.026,Coua!
00:30:29.110,00:30:29.850,我的嗓子,00:30:29.110,00:30:30.410,My voice!
00:30:30.410,00:30:32.190,我的嗓子怎么成这样了,00:30:30.410,00:30:32.530,What happened to my voice?
00:30:32.530,00:30:33.360,小主 你怎么了,00:30:32.530,00:30:33.918,"My Lady, what happened to you?"
00:30:33.990,00:30:36.950,我的嗓子我再也不能得宠了,00:30:33.918,00:30:37.530,My voice... without it I will never gain favor again.
00:30:38.080,00:30:38.700,宝鹃,00:30:38.080,00:30:39.300,Coua.
00:30:39.500,00:30:41.790,小主一定是有人故意害您的,00:30:39.500,00:30:42.170,"My Lady, someone did this to you."
00:30:42.170,00:30:43.530,小主奴婢去告诉皇后,00:30:42.170,00:30:43.643,I'm going to inform Her Majesty.
00:30:43.840,00:30:44.830,奴婢去求她帮咱们,00:30:43.840,00:30:45.170,I'm going to beg her to help us.
00:30:45.170,00:30:46.040,不许去,00:30:45.170,00:30:46.512,Don't go!
00:30:46.760,00:30:49.370,我能得宠全靠这副嗓子了,00:30:46.760,00:30:49.370,My voice is all I have to gain His Majesty's favor.
00:30:49.840,00:30:51.930,若是被人知道我嗓子成了这样,00:30:49.840,00:30:52.232,"If anyone finds out what happened to my voice,"
00:30:52.970,00:30:54.960,皇上肯定不会再喜欢我了,00:30:52.970,00:30:55.149,His Majesty will surely no longer care for me.
00:30:56.310,00:30:59.020,到时我就成了一枚弃子,00:30:56.310,00:30:59.020,Then I will become a useless pawn.
00:31:00.020,00:31:01.260,一枚弃子,00:31:00.020,00:31:01.689,A discarded pawn!
00:31:02.150,00:31:05.310,宝鹃记住我只是得了风寒,00:31:02.150,00:31:05.310,"Coua, remember this: I only caught a cold."
00:31:05.690,00:31:06.770,很快就会好的,00:31:05.690,00:31:07.072,I will recover shortly.
00:31:07.990,00:31:10.230,奴婢知道 奴婢知道了,00:31:07.990,00:31:10.230,"I understand, My Lady."
00:31:17.750,00:31:18.360,娘娘您看,00:31:17.750,00:31:18.899,"Your Highness, look!"
00:31:18.710,00:31:19.290,长姐,,,
00:31:19.460,00:31:20.040,玉娆,00:31:18.899,00:31:20.000,"- Elder sister!
- Yurao!"
00:31:20.420,00:31:20.820,二小姐,,,
00:31:21.120,00:31:21.700,给娘娘请安,00:31:20.420,00:31:22.346,"- My Second Lady!
- Peace to Your Noble Highness."
00:31:22.500,00:31:25.620,玉娆给姐姐看看,00:31:22.500,00:31:25.734,"Yurao, let me get a good look at you."
00:31:26.460,00:31:28.700,一别数年如今相见是高兴事,00:31:26.611,00:31:29.130,"It is a joyous occasion to finally reunite
 after so many years,"
00:31:29.130,00:31:30.370,长姐怎么反而哭了呢,00:31:29.130,00:31:30.982,"so why are you crying, elder sister?"
00:31:33.350,00:31:34.080,碧姐姐,00:31:33.350,00:31:34.655,Sister Jade.
00:31:34.810,00:31:36.090,二小姐长高了不少呢,00:31:34.810,00:31:36.901,My Second Lady has grown a lot taller.
00:31:37.270,00:31:38.470,皇上为娘娘高兴,00:31:37.270,00:31:39.020,His Majesty is so happy for Your Highness
00:31:39.020,00:31:41.470,特意请娘娘的家人入宫来相见,00:31:39.020,00:31:42.160,that he especially invited Your Highness's family to the palace.
00:31:42.230,00:31:43.090,皇上还说了,00:31:42.230,00:31:43.784,His Majesty also said
00:31:43.520,00:31:45.730,请二小姐安心地在宫里住下,00:31:43.784,00:31:46.230,your sister should feel comfortable staying in the palace
00:31:46.230,00:31:47.220,只当陪娘娘,00:31:46.230,00:31:48.003,to keep Your Highness company.
00:31:48.280,00:31:49.520,怎不见本宫父母呢,00:31:48.280,00:31:49.780,Where are my parents?
00:31:49.780,00:31:50.640,他们可也来了,00:31:49.780,00:31:51.197,Are they here as well?
00:31:51.450,00:31:53.190,老大人还在京中养病呢,00:31:51.450,00:31:53.506,Mr. Zhen is still recuperating in the capital.
00:31:53.660,00:31:55.610,皇上已下旨召夫人入京,00:31:53.660,00:31:56.788,"His Majesty has also summoned your mother
and sister back to Beijing."
00:31:56.080,00:31:57.320,为着叫娘娘宽心,,,
00:31:57.580,00:31:59.780,二小姐日夜兼程地先过来了,00:31:56.788,00:31:59.780,"Your sister traveled day and night
to put Your Highness at peace."
00:32:00.370,00:32:01.360,想必不多几日,,,
00:32:01.750,00:32:04.490,老大人和夫人也能在京中相聚了,00:32:00.370,00:32:04.995,"I believe both Mr. and Lady Zhen
will be able to see each other in a few days."
00:32:05.500,00:32:07.120,皇上的心意本宫心领了,00:32:05.500,00:32:07.384,I appreciate His Majesty's kind intentions.
00:32:07.840,00:32:09.670,只是本宫家父仍是罪臣,00:32:07.840,00:32:10.000,"However, my father is still a guilty official."
00:32:10.590,00:32:11.630,皇上虽开恩,,,
00:32:11.880,00:32:13.170,召了两位老人家回来,00:32:10.703,00:32:13.615,"Although His Majesty granted them the grace
to be summoned back to the capital,"
00:32:13.890,00:32:14.870,可又有什么意义,00:32:13.890,00:32:15.140,what does this achieve
00:32:15.430,00:32:16.640,倒叫他们奔波劳碌,00:32:15.329,00:32:16.980,besides adding to their fatigue?
00:32:17.140,00:32:19.470,皇上虽未让老大人官复原职,00:32:17.140,00:32:19.470,"Although His Majesty did not restore Mr. Zhen's old position,"
00:32:19.980,00:32:20.960,却已叫人修缮了,,,
00:32:21.270,00:32:22.720,娘娘家从前的宅子,00:32:19.980,00:32:23.190,he has ordered your family's former residence to be renovated
00:32:23.190,00:32:25.680,好让老大人和夫人能留在京里,00:32:23.190,00:32:26.060,so your parents can reside in the capital
00:32:26.060,00:32:27.140,颐养天年哪,00:32:26.060,00:32:27.770,and happily enjoy their years ahead.
00:32:27.770,00:32:28.560,本宫明白,00:32:27.770,00:32:29.032,I understand.
00:32:29.570,00:32:30.850,明日自会前去谢恩,00:32:29.570,00:32:31.265,I will thank His Majesty for his grace tomorrow.
00:32:31.450,00:32:32.180,你且退下吧,00:32:31.450,00:32:32.778,You may take your leave now.
00:32:32.400,00:32:34.440,是还有一桩事,00:32:32.778,00:32:34.780,Yes. There's one more matter.
00:32:35.910,00:32:37.070,十七爷说,00:32:35.910,00:32:37.440,Lord XVII said
00:32:37.450,00:32:38.860,娘娘册封之喜,00:32:37.450,00:32:39.162,"that in congratulations of Your Highness's promotion,"
00:32:39.410,00:32:40.820,旁的东西也就罢了,,,
00:32:41.120,00:32:43.080,只把凝晖堂内所有的合欢花,00:32:39.410,00:32:43.352,"he grants Your Highness all of the ""coupling joy"" trees
in the Hall of Converging Light"
00:32:43.460,00:32:44.410,都赠与娘娘,00:32:43.352,00:32:44.931,in addition to the other gifts.
00:32:45.170,00:32:45.870,王爷说,00:32:45.170,00:32:46.250,"His Lordship said,"
00:32:46.250,00:32:48.620,合欢花最能安五脏和心志,00:32:46.250,00:32:48.800,"the ""coupling joy"" flower is excellent at soothing
the five organs and the mind."
00:32:49.340,00:32:51.450,娘娘日后折来赏玩也好,00:32:49.340,00:32:51.800,Your Highness may enjoy the beauty of the flowers
00:32:51.800,00:32:52.880,熬粥补身也好,00:32:51.800,00:32:53.260,or cook them with porridge.
00:32:53.260,00:32:54.540,总不辜负了就是,00:32:53.260,00:32:55.158,He hopes you won't let them go to waste.
00:32:56.680,00:32:58.290,王爷的心意本宫心领了,00:32:56.680,00:32:58.865,I acknowledge His Lordship's thoughtfulness.
00:33:00.100,00:33:01.960,你替本宫谢过王爷,00:33:00.100,00:33:02.111,Please convey my thanks to His Lordship.
00:33:03.230,00:33:04.970,这位王爷心思倒也别致,00:33:03.230,00:33:05.159,This Lord XVII has a uniquely thoughtful mind.
00:33:05.650,00:33:06.760,不似寻常俗物,00:33:05.650,00:33:07.060,"He is unlike others,"
00:33:07.060,00:33:08.550,只懂凑些金啊玉啊的,00:33:07.060,00:33:08.890,who only present gold or jade.
00:33:09.400,00:33:11.060,二小姐头一日入宫,00:33:09.400,00:33:11.520,"This is your first day in the palace, My Second Lady."
00:33:11.690,00:33:12.930,不知道咱们十七爷,00:33:11.690,00:33:13.240,You probably have no idea
00:33:13.240,00:33:15.320,心思奇绝的地方多了去了,00:33:13.240,00:33:15.320,how unconventional Lord XVII is.
00:33:18.870,00:33:20.030,娘娘方才没回来,00:33:18.870,00:33:20.521,"Before Your Highness returned,"
00:33:20.370,00:33:20.950,奴婢已经差人,,,
00:33:21.290,00:33:22.820,把宫中的永宝堂打扫出来,00:33:20.521,00:33:23.210,"I had already ordered some servants to clear out
the Hall of Eternal Treasure"
00:33:23.210,00:33:24.070,给二小姐居住了,00:33:23.210,00:33:24.790,where My Second Lady will reside.
00:33:24.790,00:33:25.490,也好,00:33:24.979,00:33:26.090,Wonderful.
00:33:26.750,00:33:28.370,都别站着了快进屋吧,00:33:26.750,00:33:28.970,"We need not stand out here any longer.
 Let's all go inside."
00:33:29.420,00:33:30.750,那奴才先告退了,00:33:29.420,00:33:30.901,I shall take my leave.
00:33:36.180,00:33:37.880,皇上昨夜批了一夜的摺子,00:33:36.180,00:33:38.180,Your Majesty was reading memorandums all night.
00:33:38.180,00:33:38.960,太辛苦了,00:33:38.180,00:33:39.578,It is much too tiring.
00:33:39.760,00:33:41.920,熹贵妃忙于照顾一对儿女,00:33:39.760,00:33:41.920,"Noble Consort Lumière is busy
taking care of two children."
00:33:42.470,00:33:43.880,不便服侍皇上,00:33:42.470,00:33:44.640,It is inconvenient for her to serve Your Majesty.
00:33:44.890,00:33:47.680,后宫还有许多年轻的妃嫔都很好,00:33:44.890,00:33:47.680,There are many brilliant and youthful concubines in the harem.
00:33:48.020,00:33:49.850,皇上也可以经常走一走,00:33:48.020,00:33:50.190,Perhaps Your Majesty can pay them more visits as well.
00:33:50.190,00:33:53.730,朕听说安嫔吃伤了东西,00:33:50.190,00:33:53.730,I heard Concubine An got sick from something she ate.
00:33:54.030,00:33:55.110,口桑子已然倒了,00:33:54.030,00:33:55.647,Her voice has been ruined.
00:33:55.990,00:33:57.940,恐怕再也不能唱了,00:33:55.990,00:33:58.626,I'm afraid she is not capable of singing anymore.
00:33:58.950,00:33:59.780,真是可惜,00:33:58.950,00:34:00.276,What a shame.
00:34:00.490,00:34:02.360,原不过是着了风寒,00:34:00.276,00:34:02.549,"At first, it was just a cold."
00:34:02.790,00:34:04.120,将养几日便好,00:34:02.790,00:34:04.384,She could have recovered in a few days.
00:34:04.450,00:34:06.660,谁知药吃下去反而伤了喉咙,00:34:04.384,00:34:06.660,"Who would've thought that her medicine
could hurt her throat even more."
00:34:07.120,00:34:10.080,只怕以后连话都不能好好说了,00:34:07.120,00:34:10.380,"I fear she might not even be able
to talk properly in the future."
00:34:10.380,00:34:13.080,那就让她好好歇息吧,00:34:10.380,00:34:13.280,"Well then, let her take time to recuperate."
00:34:14.380,00:34:18.220,朕倒是有日子没去惠嫔那儿了,00:34:14.380,00:34:18.220,I haven't visited Concubine Vertu in a while.
00:34:20.890,00:34:23.380,如今嬛嬛已经生育,00:34:20.890,00:34:23.531,Huan Huan has already given birth.
00:34:24.220,00:34:25.960,就等着眉庄的好消息了,00:34:24.220,00:34:26.689,We're all waiting for Meizhuang's good news.
00:34:31.570,00:34:32.180,姐姐,00:34:31.141,00:34:32.566,Lumière.
00:34:34.150,00:34:34.760,是谁,00:34:34.150,00:34:35.107,Who is it?
00:34:35.360,00:34:35.690,姐姐,,,
00:34:35.820,00:34:36.520,落轿,00:34:35.607,00:34:36.985,"- Lumière.
- Lower the sedan."
00:34:37.700,00:34:38.440,落轿,00:34:37.700,00:34:39.126,Lower the sedan chair.
00:34:41.700,00:34:42.780,熹贵妃金安,00:34:41.700,00:34:43.252,Peace to Noble Consort Lumiere.
00:34:46.580,00:34:47.660,数月不见,,,
00:34:48.160,00:34:49.450,姐姐不记得陵容了吗,00:34:46.580,00:34:50.000,"After just a few months, have you forgotten me, Lumiere?"
00:34:50.420,00:34:51.370,倒不是不记得,00:34:50.420,00:34:52.078,Not that I forgot you.
00:34:52.500,00:34:54.330,只是见妹妹身子如此单弱,00:34:52.500,00:34:54.985,It's just that seeing you so weak and feeble....
00:34:55.800,00:34:58.250,想必心寒犹胜天寒,00:34:55.800,00:34:59.147,Your disappointment must be colder than this bitter weather.
00:35:00.180,00:35:01.880,陵容见惯了世态炎凉,,,
00:35:02.260,00:35:03.590,习惯了人心轻贱,00:35:00.180,00:35:04.071,"I've seen how people change like the weather
and grown used to them belittling me."
00:35:04.720,00:35:05.680,不怕心寒,00:35:04.720,00:35:06.443,I'm not afraid of being disappointed.
00:35:07.350,00:35:09.090,皇上令妹妹静养避事,00:35:07.350,00:35:10.551,"His Majesty ordered you to recuperate alone
and avoid seeing people."
00:35:09.440,00:35:10.430,以免招惹事端,,,
00:35:11.020,00:35:13.480,怎么妹妹倒出来了,00:35:11.020,00:35:13.480,"Why today, did you decide to come out?"
00:35:13.940,00:35:15.060,旁人嫌我不祥,00:35:13.940,00:35:15.880,Others avoid me fearing my ill omen.
00:35:15.900,00:35:17.940,姐姐却最清楚我是否不祥,00:35:15.920,00:35:18.600,You know best whether I carry bad fortune
00:35:18.570,00:35:19.430,哪里不祥,00:35:18.600,00:35:20.000,and what my misfortune truly is.
00:35:20.610,00:35:22.070,本宫不过一句闲话,00:35:20.610,00:35:22.532,I meant only to express concern for your well-being.
00:35:22.990,00:35:23.860,安妹妹怎么就说,,,
00:35:24.120,00:35:25.480,自己是不祥之身了,00:35:22.990,00:35:25.480,Why do you say you're bad luck?
00:35:26.790,00:35:28.120,这般自轻自贱,,,
00:35:28.790,00:35:30.320,当真是叫本宫伤心,00:35:26.790,00:35:30.764,"It saddens me to hear
such self-contempt and self-degradation."
00:35:31.580,00:35:32.950,且既然不便出门,00:35:31.580,00:35:33.120,Your circumstance is already inconvenient.
00:35:33.840,00:35:35.790,为何还装了这么多心思在心里,00:35:33.743,00:35:36.054,Why insist on coming out to speak of such burdensome thoughts?
00:35:37.170,00:35:38.710,妹妹今日如此境地,00:35:37.170,00:35:39.232,Perhaps your current predicament
00:35:39.800,00:35:41.660,安知不是素日操心太过,00:35:40.000,00:35:41.760,was caused by over-exerting your mind.
00:35:42.300,00:35:44.090,姐姐本知我是轻贱之人,00:35:42.448,00:35:44.850,You know that I come from lowly origins.
00:35:44.850,00:35:46.050,世上贵人之多,,,
00:35:46.770,00:35:48.300,难免将我更轻贱些,00:35:44.850,00:35:49.409,"There are so many noble people in this world,
making me all the more insignificant."
00:35:49.520,00:35:50.720,仔爱容只能自强,00:35:49.742,00:35:51.799,I can only strive to become stronger.
00:35:53.190,00:35:54.220,自强当然好,00:35:53.190,00:35:55.089,It is definitely good to stengthen oneself.
00:35:55.440,00:35:57.930,只是别用错心机 枉顾性命就好,00:35:55.440,00:35:58.628,Just not in an immoral way that costs innocent lives.
00:35:59.320,00:36:01.230,人心不足 机关算尽,00:35:59.320,00:36:01.796,"If one plots every step of the way and becomes insatiable,"
00:36:02.410,00:36:05.610,往往过分自强便成了自戕,00:36:02.410,00:36:05.610,excessive self-strengthening will become self-harm.
00:36:07.290,00:36:08.270,如今在宫中,,,
00:36:08.660,00:36:10.070,论谁能强过姐姐呢,00:36:07.290,00:36:10.429,"Now no one is stronger than you in the palace,"
00:36:11.120,00:36:13.450,也没有比陵容更无用无依的人了,00:36:11.120,00:36:13.714,whereas no one is more abject and abandoned than me.
00:36:14.330,00:36:15.870,姐姐是最有福气之人,00:36:14.330,00:36:16.535,"You are the most blessed person, Lumière."
00:36:16.920,00:36:18.710,陵容只有沾沾姐姐的福气,00:36:16.920,00:36:20.677,"I can turn peril into safety
if I can dip myself in your good fortune."
00:36:19.050,00:36:20.130,便能化险为夷,,,
00:36:21.090,00:36:23.500,有了姐姐我还怕什么呢,00:36:21.090,00:36:23.990,"With you as my sister, what would I fear?"
00:36:24.590,00:36:25.580,借妹妹吉言,00:36:24.590,00:36:26.420,I wish your auspicious words would come true.
00:36:26.970,00:36:28.090,本宫自然记得,,,
00:36:29.310,00:36:31.670,妹妹对本宫是何等姐妹情深,00:36:26.970,00:36:31.983,"I certainly remember how, as my sister,
you treated me with such deep affection."
00:36:33.440,00:36:35.640,必然滴水之恩涌泉相报,00:36:33.440,00:36:36.592,"I will ""repay every drop of 'kindness' with a fountain of gratitude."""
00:36:36.770,00:36:37.810,绝不辜负,00:36:36.770,00:36:38.720,You can count on me for this.
00:36:40.490,00:36:41.600,妹妹也是如此,00:36:40.490,00:36:42.204,I also feel the same way.
00:36:50.620,00:36:51.480,听她这声音,,,
00:36:52.250,00:36:54.360,这把嗓子是真的废了,00:36:50.620,00:36:54.360,"Judging from her voice, her throat is truly ruined."
00:36:56.210,00:36:57.820,不知是天意还是人为,00:36:56.210,00:36:58.334,I don't know if it was ordained by Heaven or arranged by man.
00:37:00.000,00:37:02.540,小主现在她已失宠了,00:37:00.000,00:37:02.540,"My Lady, now that she's lost favor,"
00:37:03.130,00:37:03.920,我们正好,,,
00:37:04.880,00:37:06.370,无声无息地了结了她,00:37:03.130,00:37:06.360,it's a good chance for us to send her off quietly.
00:37:07.800,00:37:11.050,在宫中死是最好的解脱,00:37:07.800,00:37:11.201,"In the palace, death is the best way out."
00:37:12.850,00:37:15.060,她深受皇宠多年又性子要强,00:37:12.850,00:37:16.114,"She enjoyed His Majesty's favor for many years
and has a strong character."
00:37:16.270,00:37:17.850,如今她失宠受辱,00:37:16.270,00:37:18.480,"Now that she lost favor and is humiliated,"
00:37:18.480,00:37:21.720,当真比死还叫她难受百倍,00:37:18.480,00:37:22.149,"life is a hundred times more agonizing
than death for her."
00:37:23.490,00:37:24.350,奴婢明白了,00:37:23.490,00:37:25.079,I understand.
00:37:25.990,00:37:28.480,奴婢一定会知会各宫娘娘小主,00:37:25.990,00:37:30.629,I will inform the other concubines to take good care of Concubine An.
00:37:28.780,00:37:30.150,让她们好好关照安嫔,,,
00:37:40.960,00:37:42.330,你们干什么呀干什么呀,00:37:40.960,00:37:42.632,What are you doing? What are you doing?
00:37:42.800,00:37:44.130,在娘娘房里这样捣乱,00:37:42.800,00:37:44.320,Damaging the room of Her Highness?
00:37:44.840,00:37:46.710,别贴了别贴了,00:37:44.840,00:37:46.710,Stop putting up talismans!  Stop!
00:37:47.550,00:37:49.210,我们也是为安嫔你好啊,00:37:47.550,00:37:49.625,"Concubine An, we are doing this for your own good."
00:37:49.800,00:37:51.260,连皇上都说你晦气,00:37:49.800,00:37:51.524,Even His Majesty said you're bad luck.
00:37:51.890,00:37:53.600,我们姐妹特意去宝华殿,00:37:51.890,00:37:53.850,We made a special trip to the Baohua Hall
00:37:53.850,00:37:55.970,给你求了符纸和符水来驱邪,00:37:53.850,00:37:56.611,to get talisman papers and water to drive out evil spirits.
00:37:57.440,00:37:58.270,多贴点啊,00:37:57.440,00:37:58.770,Put up more talismans.
00:37:58.770,00:38:00.430,被子跟柜子都别忘了,00:37:58.770,00:38:00.430,Don't forget the quilt and cabinet.
00:38:00.940,00:38:02.020,你们这是干什么呀,00:38:00.940,00:38:02.449,What on earth are you doing?
00:38:03.990,00:38:05.150,别洒了别洒了,00:38:03.990,00:38:05.570,Don't spray the water!
00:38:05.570,00:38:06.400,你们都疯了吗,00:38:05.570,00:38:06.950,Are you all out of your mind?
00:38:06.950,00:38:07.730,娘娘就算不祥,00:38:06.950,00:38:08.226,"Even if Her Highness is inauspicious,"
00:38:08.070,00:38:09.730,也轮不到你们来延禧宫吵闹,00:38:08.226,00:38:10.240,"it is not your place to disturb
the Palace of Prolonging Happiness."
00:38:10.330,00:38:11.820,安嫔不祥连累后宫,00:38:10.330,00:38:12.160,Concubine An bears ill fortune which harms the harem.
00:38:12.160,00:38:13.320,自然人人都可以管,00:38:12.160,00:38:13.814,Therefore it concerns everyone.
00:38:14.160,00:38:16.370,符纸不烧又怎么会有效呢,00:38:14.160,00:38:16.483,The talismans won't be effective if they are not burned.
00:38:16.920,00:38:17.570,快烧吧,00:38:16.920,00:38:18.299,Burn them quickly.
00:38:26.050,00:38:28.040,小主贞嫔和康常在,00:38:26.050,00:38:28.078,"My Lady, as expected, Concubine Fidèle
and Attendant Kang"
00:38:28.380,00:38:29.340,果然去延禧宫闹上了,00:38:28.078,00:38:30.302,"went to the Palace of Prolonging Happiness
 and created a disturbance."
00:38:30.800,00:38:31.630,皇后知道了吗,00:38:30.800,00:38:32.260,Does the Empress know about this?
00:38:32.260,00:38:33.130,大约是知道了,00:38:32.260,00:38:33.816,She probably does.
00:38:34.020,00:38:35.300,但是皇后却没有过问,00:38:34.020,00:38:35.600,But she didn't inquire about it any further.
00:38:36.270,00:38:39.180,别理她日后还有的闹呢,00:38:36.270,00:38:39.180,Just let them be. There's more to come.
00:38:44.320,00:38:46.350,小主没炭火了,00:38:44.320,00:38:46.400,"My Lady, the charcoal has run out."
00:38:46.950,00:38:48.650,您先抱个汤婆子暖暖吧,00:38:46.950,00:38:48.650,Please use this hot water bottle to warm yourself.
00:38:50.070,00:38:51.530,只有那点热水了,00:38:50.070,00:38:51.643,We only have a little hot water remaining
00:38:51.830,00:38:53.160,还要用来喝水洗脸,00:38:51.830,00:38:53.273,and we also need to drink and wash our faces.
00:38:53.450,00:38:54.690,哪能用来抱汤婆子,00:38:53.450,00:38:55.419,How can we afford to use it in hot water bottles?
00:38:56.250,00:38:57.530,又下了几场大雪,00:38:56.250,00:38:59.520,It snowed several times and is getting colder and colder.
00:38:58.290,00:38:59.530,天气越来越冷了,,,
00:39:00.460,00:39:02.700,能盖的被子奴婢都给您盖上了,00:39:00.460,00:39:02.700,I have covered you with all the quilts we have.
00:39:03.630,00:39:06.590,若是没有地龙可真要冻死了,00:39:03.630,00:39:06.590,"We would freeze to death if it were not for
 the underground heating."
00:39:09.050,00:39:10.590,咱们若是冻死在这儿,00:39:09.050,00:39:13.232,Would anybody know if we freeze to death here?
00:39:11.850,00:39:12.760,可有人知道,,,
00:39:14.970,00:39:15.590,小主,00:39:14.970,00:39:16.233,My Lady.

00:39:18.810,00:39:20.720,我和贞嫔惦记着您呢,00:39:18.810,00:39:20.909,Concubine Fidèle and I have been thinking of you.
00:39:22.060,00:39:23.020,你们又来做什么,00:39:22.060,00:39:23.020,What are you up to this time?
00:39:23.570,00:39:24.430,姐妹一场,00:39:23.570,00:39:25.007,We brought some charcoal for you
00:39:24.730,00:39:26.060,知道安嫔你没炭过冬,,,
00:39:26.650,00:39:27.770,特意给你送来,00:39:25.007,00:39:27.760,"since we are all sisters
and we know you don't have enough."
00:39:28.440,00:39:29.270,拿上来吧,00:39:28.440,00:39:29.841,Bring it in.
00:39:32.820,00:39:33.560,黑占上吧,00:39:32.820,00:39:34.074,Light it.
00:39:34.580,00:39:35.410,没炭火,,,
00:39:35.580,00:39:38.070,这冰天雪地的可怎么熬过去呀,00:39:34.580,00:39:38.400,How can you survive the cold and the snow without charcoal?
00:39:39.160,00:39:41.370,只一点安嫔你得明白,00:39:39.160,00:39:41.370,"But Concubine An, you need to understand that"
00:39:41.880,00:39:43.330,今时不同往日,00:39:41.880,00:39:43.595,times have changed.
00:39:44.210,00:39:46.620,我们姐妹也没什么好炭能送的,00:39:44.387,00:39:46.640,We can't afford to give you any high-quality charcoal.
00:39:47.130,00:39:48.290,您就将就着用吧,00:39:47.130,00:39:48.800,You'll have to make do with this.
00:39:51.090,00:39:53.210,别点了 别点了 呛死人了,00:39:51.090,00:39:53.639,Stop! Stop! The smoke is suffocating.
00:39:54.010,00:39:56.750,快点 点上 不点怎么能暖和,00:39:54.010,00:39:57.120,"Quick, get the fire going!
Otherwise how can you get warm?"
00:39:57.560,00:39:59.220,本宫以延禧宫主位的身份,00:39:57.560,00:40:00.960,"As the head of the Palace of Prolonging Happiness,
I order you to leave"
00:39:59.850,00:40:00.970,命你们退出延示喜宫,,,
00:40:01.390,00:40:02.380,不得在这里胡闹,00:40:01.040,00:40:02.650,and stop your misbehavior here!
00:40:02.650,00:40:04.350,你还以为自己是得宠的安嫔哪,00:40:02.650,00:40:04.860,Do you still think you're the favored Concubine An?
00:40:04.860,00:40:05.640,省了吧,00:40:04.860,00:40:06.070,Forget about that.
00:40:06.070,00:40:07.050,你现在的日子,,,
00:40:07.400,00:40:08.980,过得连我的宫女都不如,00:40:06.070,00:40:08.960,Your life now is worse than my servants.
00:40:09.740,00:40:11.320,少拿着鸡毛当令箭,00:40:09.740,00:40:11.820,"""Don't wave a chicken feather like a commander's arrow!"""
00:40:11.820,00:40:12.400,闹什么,00:40:11.820,00:40:13.257,Stop making noise!
00:40:17.200,00:40:19.440,太后卧病需要静养,00:40:17.200,00:40:19.795,The Empress Dowager is sick and needs rest.
00:40:20.250,00:40:21.240,谁敢在这儿胡闹,00:40:20.250,00:40:21.969,Who dares to make a scene here?
00:40:23.670,00:40:25.620,皇后娘娘听说了延禧宫的事,00:40:23.670,00:40:26.160,"Her Majesty the Empress is aware of what has happened here,"
00:40:26.340,00:40:27.870,特地叫奴婢传来口谕,00:40:26.160,00:40:28.407,so she ordered me to deliver her decree.
00:40:28.840,00:40:30.670,延禧宫的宫女不能护主,00:40:28.840,00:40:31.120,"The servants of the Palace of Prolonging Happiness
were unable to protect their mistress."
00:40:31.130,00:40:32.090,罚俸一个月,00:40:31.160,00:40:32.733,They will forfeit one month's stipend.
00:40:33.380,00:40:35.470,康常在贞嫔身边的人,,,
00:40:36.010,00:40:38.170,不能劝谏小主雪天胡闹,00:40:33.380,00:40:38.428,"The servants of Concubine Fidèle and Attendant Kang
failed to persuade their mistresses not to make trouble."
00:40:38.850,00:40:39.800,罚俸三个月,00:40:38.428,00:40:41.255,"- They are penalized with a fine of three months' stipend.
- Yes."
00:40:40.100,00:40:40.840,是,,,
00:40:44.600,00:40:45.560,快带着走,00:40:44.600,00:40:46.375,Take this away quickly.
00:40:51.900,00:40:52.890,小主安心吧,00:40:51.900,00:40:53.649,"My Lady, please be assured."
00:40:53.820,00:40:55.440,娘娘虽然也在困顿之中,00:40:53.820,00:40:55.831,"Although Her Majesty is also in a difficult situation,"
00:40:56.160,00:40:57.650,可是从来没有忘记过小主,00:40:56.160,00:40:57.952,she has never forgotten about you.
00:40:58.660,00:41:01.490,这不让奴婢带来了棉被和炭火,00:40:58.660,00:41:04.084,"She bade me bring you quilts and charcoal
so you won't have these worries over the winter."
00:41:02.120,00:41:03.660,小主也好安心过冬了呀,,,
00:41:09.500,00:41:10.660,多谢娘娘恩典,00:41:09.500,00:41:11.535,I thank Her Majesty for her benevolence.
00:41:12.590,00:41:14.500,宝鹃 收下吧,00:41:12.590,00:41:14.500,"Sparrow, take them."
00:41:15.260,00:41:15.960,是,00:41:15.260,00:41:16.646,Yes.
00:41:19.470,00:41:21.180,小主自打嗓子坏了以后,,,
00:41:21.810,00:41:23.390,皇上可就再没提起您呢,00:41:19.470,00:41:24.089,"Ever since your throat became damaged,
 His Majesty has not mentioned you."
00:41:24.690,00:41:26.430,小主也该想个新的出路啊,00:41:24.690,00:41:26.902,"My Lady, you need to find a new path forward."
00:41:30.780,00:41:31.360,娘娘,00:41:30.780,00:41:32.046,Your Majesty.
00:41:32.940,00:41:33.680,都好了吗,00:41:32.940,00:41:34.259,Is it done?
00:41:34.070,00:41:34.730,都好了,00:41:34.259,00:41:35.545,Yes.
00:41:39.240,00:41:41.150,锦上添花有什么意思,00:41:39.240,00:41:41.400,"""Adding flowers to the brocade"" never earns you true gratitude."
00:41:41.580,00:41:44.820,雪中送炭才让人记得好处呢,00:41:41.580,00:41:44.820,"""Sending charcoal on a snowy day""
makes people remember your kindness."
00:41:45.160,00:41:47.160,奴婢把该讲的话都讲给安嫔听了,00:41:45.160,00:41:47.160,I've told her all that should be said.
00:41:47.710,00:41:48.790,但愿她能受教,00:41:47.710,00:41:49.579,Hopefully she will learn from it.
00:41:49.750,00:41:52.620,一个人只有到了绝境才懂得反抗,00:41:49.750,00:41:51.497,Only when one is in a desperate situation
00:41:53.210,00:41:54.700,才懂得义无返顾,00:41:51.497,00:41:55.300,do they learn to fight back and press ahead without hesitating.
00:41:55.880,00:41:58.170,本宫让你教她是成全她,00:41:55.880,00:41:58.560,I'm helping her by asking you to advise her.
00:41:59.390,00:42:01.920,反正祺贵人已经下手了,00:41:59.390,00:42:01.920,"Since Noble Lady Délice has already made this move,"
00:42:02.390,00:42:04.680,安嫔的嗓子也很难再好了,00:42:02.390,00:42:04.906,Concubine An's throat is unlikely to recover.
00:42:05.890,00:42:08.100,本宫就干脆让她全坏了吧,00:42:05.890,00:42:08.743,I might as well ruin it once and for all.
00:42:09.690,00:42:12.600,连甯贵人的鹦鹉都懂得吟诗了,00:42:09.690,00:42:12.600,Even the parrot of Noble Lady Paix can recite poems now.
00:42:13.070,00:42:15.150,她也该想想别的出路了,00:42:13.070,00:42:15.461,Concubine An should think of a new strategy.
00:42:15.740,00:42:16.570,娘娘圣明,00:42:15.740,00:42:17.556,Your Majesty is wise.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
