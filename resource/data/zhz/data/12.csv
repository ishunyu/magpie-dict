00:02:22.200,00:02:23.830,启禀皇上 皇后,,,
00:02:24.240,00:02:26.870,曹贵人带温宜公主前来请安,00:02:23.300,00:02:28.100,"Your Majesties, Lady Cao brought
Princess Wenyi here to pay respects."
00:02:27.120,00:02:28.630,大热天的带着公主出来,,,
00:02:28.840,00:02:31.070,别中了暑气才好 快请进来吧,00:02:28.120,00:02:31.200,"Bringing the princess here on such a hot day
could cause excessive internal heat."
00:02:31.560,00:02:32.110,嗻,00:02:31.389,00:02:32.829,Show her in quickly.
00:02:45.280,00:02:48.710,皇上万福 皇后万福,00:02:46.388,00:02:49.836,Grace to Your Majesties.
00:02:49.360,00:02:50.580,这个时候日头大,00:02:50.574,00:02:52.020,The sun is ablaze at this hour.
00:02:51.960,00:02:54.520,你怎么还抱着公主走来走去,00:02:53.066,00:02:55.774,Why did you come out with the princess?
00:02:54.800,00:02:56.430,你倒不怕 她受得了吗,,,
00:02:56.800,00:02:57.860,皇上教训得是,00:02:56.000,00:02:57.860,"Even if you are able to endure it, can she?"
00:02:58.520,00:03:01.190,只是晨起公主便啼哭不已,00:02:57.860,00:02:59.520,Your Majesty is right.
00:03:01.600,00:03:03.670,想是许久不见皇后娘娘,00:02:59.746,00:03:02.574,"However, the princess was crying all morning."
00:03:03.920,00:03:05.510,因此想念娘娘了,00:03:02.800,00:03:06.800,"I thought she must be missing Her Majesty.
[The empress is the formal mother of all imperial children.]"
00:03:05.800,00:03:08.870,罢了 朕也好久不见公主了,00:03:06.800,00:03:10.300,"Never mind. I haven't seen Wenyi for some time, either."
00:03:09.320,00:03:10.380,来 给朕抱抱,00:03:10.489,00:03:12.340,"Come here, I will hold her."
00:03:20.400,00:03:23.110,几日不见 怎么公主抱着轻了些,00:03:21.488,00:03:24.560,She feels lighter than she was a few days ago.
00:03:23.600,00:03:25.710,天气炎热 公主吃不下,,,
00:03:26.000,00:03:26.870,难免瘦了点,00:03:24.786,00:03:28.206,"She hasn't been eating a lot lately.
The hot weather weakens her appetite."
00:03:29.000,00:03:30.670,温宜年幼怕热,00:03:30.000,00:03:32.321,Wenyi is still young and vulnerable to the heat.
00:03:31.560,00:03:33.270,嫔妃们只怕也受不住,00:03:32.698,00:03:34.840,I'm afraid the concubines are struggling as well.
00:03:34.040,00:03:34.870,天气太热,00:03:35.104,00:03:36.240,It's been sweltering.
00:03:35.760,00:03:37.830,不如去圆明园避避暑,00:03:36.577,00:03:39.120,"How about we move to the
Summer Palace to escape the heat?"
00:03:38.120,00:03:39.870,圆明园那边一直打点着,,,
00:03:40.120,00:03:41.470,皇上可以随时起驾,00:03:39.226,00:03:42.900,"The Summer Palace is regularly maintained.
Your Majesty can depart at any time."
00:03:42.120,00:03:43.950,朕也想去那儿住段日子,,,
00:03:44.320,00:03:46.110,先前给先帝爷服丧,00:03:43.239,00:03:45.360,I'd like to stay there for a while.
00:03:46.400,00:03:47.430,有两年都没去了,00:03:45.360,00:03:48.780,"It has been the mourning period for the prior emperor,
so I haven't been there for two years."
00:03:48.360,00:03:49.580,说去倒也容易,,,
00:03:50.080,00:03:51.990,只是跟着去的妃嫔不多,00:03:49.377,00:03:51.140,Moving there is not difficult.
00:03:52.280,00:03:54.150,皇上想哪几个跟着去呀,00:03:51.200,00:03:53.560,But the Summer Palace cannot accommodate all the concubines.
00:03:56.120,00:03:57.670,她们两个自不必说,00:03:53.560,00:03:55.540,Which ones should accompany Your Majesty?
00:03:58.200,00:04:01.350,这些皇子公主的生母自然要跟着,00:03:57.195,00:03:59.240,These two without doubt.
00:04:01.720,00:04:02.830,方便起居照顾,00:03:59.280,00:04:04.000,"The mothers of the princes and princesses
will follow to take care of their children."
00:04:03.760,00:04:05.870,再叫上敬嫔也就是了,00:04:05.220,00:04:07.540,And Concubine Estime. That will be all.
00:04:06.800,00:04:08.190,端妃身子最弱,,,
00:04:08.640,00:04:11.020,在宫里养病怕是不相宜,00:04:07.902,00:04:09.764,Consort Honnête has the weakest health.
00:04:11.640,00:04:12.780,她也跟着去吧,00:04:09.764,00:04:13.772,"She should go with us for recuperation
instead of staying in the palace."
00:04:13.120,00:04:13.830,这个自然,,,
00:04:14.440,00:04:15.660,那么华妃,00:04:13.961,00:04:15.323,(sigh) Of course.
00:04:16.760,00:04:18.110,不如留下她照看,00:04:15.474,00:04:16.865,As for Consort Fleur...
00:04:18.520,00:04:20.150,紫禁城余下的嫔妃吧,00:04:17.996,00:04:20.856,"I suggest that she stay to take care of
the remaining concubines in the palace."
00:04:21.920,00:04:22.900,这个步摇,00:04:22.903,00:04:24.284,This hairpin ...
00:04:24.840,00:04:27.270,这个步摇是朕赐给华妃的吧,00:04:25.400,00:04:28.540,I remember this was my gift to Consort Fleur.
00:04:28.000,00:04:28.790,是,,,
00:04:29.320,00:04:31.350,华妃娘娘每次戴着这个步摇,00:04:29.000,00:04:30.251,Yes.
00:04:31.680,00:04:32.510,公主都会笑,00:04:30.440,00:04:33.600,"The princess was always happy to see
Her Highness wearing this hairpin."
00:04:32.920,00:04:36.510,因此华妃便赐予臣妾逗着公主玩,00:04:33.977,00:04:37.749,So Her Highness gave it to me to play with Wenyi.
00:04:39.760,00:04:40.590,华妃也去,00:04:40.620,00:04:42.280,Consort Fleur will go as well.
00:04:41.760,00:04:42.670,是,00:04:42.884,00:04:43.811,Certainly.
00:06:47.800,00:06:50.630,是谁的心思竟想得这样妥贴,00:06:49.000,00:06:52.180,"Whose mind was so considerate
to have arranged all this for me?"
00:06:51.160,00:06:53.590,皇上知道小主素性爱香,,,
00:06:53.920,00:06:55.790,为避暑热又不宜焚香,00:06:52.240,00:06:57.100,"My Lady, His Majesty knows you like having your room scented
but wishes to avoid burning incense in the summer heat."
00:06:56.120,00:06:59.390,因此特意命奴才取新鲜香花,,,
00:06:59.640,00:07:01.710,又放风轮纳凉取香,00:06:57.326,00:07:02.907,"Therefore, at His Majesty's behest, we arranged
flowers and the rotating fan for you, My Lady."
00:07:07.600,00:07:08.950,果然又香又凉快,00:07:08.794,00:07:10.315,What a sweet and cooling breeze!
00:07:09.840,00:07:11.710,别的小主那里全没有,,,
00:07:12.000,00:07:14.070,小主是头一份儿的呢,00:07:10.880,00:07:15.040,"The rotating fan is exclusive to you
among all the concubines, My Lady."
00:07:14.840,00:07:15.950,这法子真是巧,,,
00:07:16.400,00:07:17.790,皇上真真是有心了,00:07:16.000,00:07:19.031,"What an ingenious design!
His Majesty devoted so much thought."
00:07:18.080,00:07:19.270,如今天还不热,,,
00:07:19.560,00:07:20.910,一到了三伏日子,00:07:19.220,00:07:22.300,"When it gets into the San Fu days [the hottest days],"
00:07:21.160,00:07:23.510,在殿里放上冰窖里启出的冰块,00:07:22.340,00:07:24.940,ice will be sent here from the ice house.
00:07:23.840,00:07:26.270,那才叫一个舒服透心呢,00:07:24.940,00:07:27.491,It will waft gentle coolness to delight your heart.
00:07:26.920,00:07:29.150,皇上一早吩咐了咱内务府,,,
00:07:29.520,00:07:32.270,只要小主一觉热马上就用冰,00:07:27.900,00:07:33.620,"His Majesty has already ordered us to send you ice
immediately if you feel hot, My Lady."
00:07:32.560,00:07:34.750,奴才们哪敢不用心呢,00:07:33.620,00:07:36.260,We will be most diligent in accommodating your needs.
00:07:35.800,00:07:36.780,黄公公辛苦了,,,
00:07:37.840,00:07:39.670,还得劳烦您去回皇上的话,00:07:37.000,00:07:38.715,"Thank you for your hard work, Mr Huang."
00:07:39.960,00:07:41.550,说我等一下亲自过去谢恩,00:07:38.941,00:07:42.920,"May I trouble you to inform His Majesty that
I will visit him shortly to thank him in person?"
00:07:42.120,00:07:44.390,小主这话奴才怎么敢担当,00:07:43.226,00:07:45.771,"With the greatest pleasure, My Lady."
00:07:45.000,00:07:46.430,只是皇上等会儿,,,
00:07:46.680,00:07:48.270,怕是要去引见楼练骑射,00:07:46.149,00:07:49.554,"But I'm afraid His Majesty
is going to practice mounted archery soon."
00:07:48.640,00:07:51.310,小主可歇歇再慢慢过去,00:07:49.780,00:07:52.940,Perhaps you want to have some rest and go at a later time.
00:07:52.160,00:07:54.460,这会儿练骑射 是谁陪着,00:07:53.166,00:07:56.100,"Mounted archery at this hour?
Who will His Majesty go with?"
00:07:55.320,00:07:56.990,果郡王和曹贵人,,,
00:07:57.360,00:07:58.110,曹贵人,00:07:56.326,00:07:58.400,Noble Prince Guo and Lady Cao.
00:07:58.280,00:07:58.870,是啊,00:07:58.400,00:07:59.323,Lady Cao?
00:07:59.120,00:08:00.630,温宜公主身体好转,,,
00:08:00.880,00:08:03.180,皇上想见见曹贵人,00:07:59.323,00:08:04.403,"Yes. Princess Wenyi has been feeling better.
His Majesty wished to see them."
00:08:07.600,00:08:09.150,听说皇上喜欢圆明园,,,
00:08:09.440,00:08:10.990,说来我也头一回来呢,00:08:08.842,00:08:12.320,"I always heard that His Majesty is very fond of the Summer Palace.
This is my first time here!"
00:08:11.200,00:08:11.830,对了 小主,,,
00:08:12.120,00:08:13.390,听说这回端妃也来了,00:08:12.320,00:08:14.620,"My Lady, I heard that Consort Honnête came as well."
00:08:13.640,00:08:15.430,咱们还不知道端妃是什么样子呢,00:08:14.680,00:08:16.740,We have never seen Her Highness.
00:08:16.000,00:08:17.190,端妃卧病多年,,,
00:08:17.520,00:08:19.310,日子处久了 总会照面的,00:08:17.155,00:08:21.166,"Consort Honnête has been bed-ridden for years.
We will get to see her sooner or later."
00:08:21.920,00:08:22.750,什么东西,00:08:23.000,00:08:24.085,What is that?
00:08:27.480,00:08:28.390,好箭法,,,
00:08:29.440,00:08:30.750,这是京西的野鸽子,00:08:28.500,00:08:30.040,What exceptional archery!
00:08:31.120,00:08:32.340,以灵巧轻捷著称,00:08:30.342,00:08:33.700,The wild pigeons in west Beijing are known for their swiftness.
00:08:33.080,00:08:34.350,能一箭贯穿四目,,,
00:08:34.920,00:08:36.030,箭法实在精准,00:08:34.115,00:08:37.618,But the archer shot two pigeons through four eyes with one arrow.
00:08:37.600,00:08:38.580,莞贵人吉祥,,,
00:08:39.200,00:08:40.870,是皇上在园子里练骑射吗,00:08:38.500,00:08:40.000,Peace to Lady Sourire.
00:08:41.240,00:08:42.030,果郡王来了,00:08:40.140,00:08:42.260,Is it His Majesty who is practicing archery?
00:08:42.480,00:08:44.150,皇上与王爷顺手打了野物,00:08:42.449,00:08:45.547,"Noble Prince Guo came to visit.
His Lordship is hunting casually with His Majesty."
00:08:45.240,00:08:46.790,今儿倒是真的果郡王来了,00:08:46.374,00:08:48.574,The true Noble Prince Guo.
00:08:48.080,00:08:49.060,我听流朱说,,,
00:08:49.400,00:08:52.310,那日小主与皇上在御花园里初见,,,
00:08:52.720,00:08:54.710,皇上便自称是果郡王来着,00:08:49.202,00:08:55.980,"Vermilion told me that His Majesty pretended
to be Noble Prince Guo when he first met you in the garden."
00:08:55.040,00:08:56.430,今儿倒是逢上真主了,,,
00:08:57.280,00:08:58.470,皇上箭法真准,00:08:56.000,00:08:57.880,Now we have the real person here.
00:08:58.880,00:09:00.150,果郡王箭术精良,00:08:58.415,00:08:59.900,His Majesty has excellent archery skills.
00:09:00.480,00:09:01.590,皇上也赞不绝口呢,00:08:59.900,00:09:02.980,"It was Noble Prince Guo.
His Majesty was also full of praise for His Lordship."
00:09:02.280,00:09:04.660,素闻果郡王擅于琴棋诗画,00:09:03.415,00:09:05.960,"Noble Prince Guo is known
for his achievement in the four arts."
00:09:05.000,00:09:06.470,倒不想箭法也这样好,,,
00:09:06.720,00:09:07.700,姑娘才来不知道,00:09:05.960,00:09:07.946,It's a surprise that he excels at archery too.
00:09:08.080,00:09:09.830,咱们王爷呀 会得多着呢,00:09:07.946,00:09:11.504,"Miss, you'll discover more of His Lordship's
versatility as you stay longer in the palace. use of ""miss"""
00:09:10.800,00:09:13.070,小厦子 你快捧了野鸽子去吧,00:09:11.957,00:09:14.480,"Xiao-Xiazi, you should bring back
the pigeons quickly."
00:09:13.560,00:09:14.990,一并替我向皇上通报,,,
00:09:15.320,00:09:17.190,说我等下就去勤政殿请安,00:09:14.669,00:09:18.540,"And please inform His Majesty that I will pay respects
to him when he returns to the Governance Hall."
00:09:17.680,00:09:18.430,奴才告退,00:09:18.766,00:09:20.277,"I take my leave, My Lady."
00:09:21.360,00:09:23.630,朕记得你的箭术,,,
00:09:23.920,00:09:25.670,是皇阿玛手把手教的,00:09:22.900,00:09:27.160,I remember that Father taught you archery personally.
00:09:27.080,00:09:28.510,皇兄的骑射师傅,,,
00:09:28.800,00:09:29.910,是满洲第一巴图鲁,00:09:28.400,00:09:31.366,"Your Majesty's archery shifu was
the greatest baturu [Machu warrior]."
00:09:30.720,00:09:31.590,臣弟愚钝,,,
00:09:32.320,00:09:33.870,虽是皇阿玛亲手所教,,,
00:09:34.440,00:09:36.190,可并没有学到皇阿玛的真传,00:09:31.753,00:09:37.520,"Even though Father taught me,
my dull mind did not learn the true skills."
00:09:37.200,00:09:38.950,巴图鲁教的是箭术,,,
00:09:39.680,00:09:42.870,皇阿玛给的是舐犊之情,00:09:38.177,00:09:44.160,"What barturu taught was archery skills;
what Father gave was his affection."
00:09:44.160,00:09:47.550,皇阿玛还是偏心你的,00:09:45.480,00:09:48.769,Father was always more nurturing toward you.
00:09:50.240,00:09:51.910,天将降大任于斯人也,,,
00:09:52.160,00:09:53.300,必先苦其心志,00:09:51.400,00:09:55.128,"""Before conferring great responsibilities on a man,
Heaven first suffers his mind to hardship and adversities."""
00:09:54.000,00:09:55.670,恰恰是皇阿玛的这一偏爱,,,
00:09:56.240,00:09:57.990,臣弟倒成了无用之人了,00:09:55.160,00:09:59.564,"It's precisely because of Father's indulgence
that I ended up becoming a useless person."
00:10:07.080,00:10:09.590,你今日也累了 早点回去歇息,00:10:07.900,00:10:11.220,"You've had a long day.
You should go have some rest."
00:10:10.160,00:10:11.300,朕回勤政殿了,00:10:11.220,00:10:13.000,I shall return to the Governance Hall.
00:10:13.120,00:10:14.260,皇上起驾,,,
00:10:15.000,00:10:15.790,恭送皇上,00:10:14.200,00:10:15.860,His Majesty departs.
,,,00:10:16.199,00:10:17.446,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:10:26.680,00:10:28.230,皇上万福金安,,,
00:10:28.520,00:10:29.230,你来了,00:10:27.800,00:10:29.631,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:10:32.320,00:10:35.310,这老十七费尽了工夫,00:10:29.631,00:10:30.787,You've arrived.
00:10:36.320,00:10:38.780,寻了这半斤雪顶含翠,00:10:33.456,00:10:40.156,"Through significant effort, my seventeenth brother managed to acquire this half catty of  ""snow-topped jade""."
00:10:39.560,00:10:40.670,真真是好茶,,,
00:10:41.520,00:10:42.740,你也来品一杯,00:10:40.420,00:10:42.380,It is such fine tea.
00:10:44.160,00:10:45.470,皇上真是好兴致,00:10:42.644,00:10:44.460,You should try some.
00:10:47.040,00:10:48.260,听说雪顶含翠,00:10:45.339,00:10:47.228,You Majesty seems to be in a great mood.
00:10:48.480,00:10:50.750,生长于极北苦寒之地的险峻山峰,00:10:48.520,00:10:53.400,"I heard that the ""snow-topped jade"" can only
be found on dangerous precipices in the cold far north."
00:10:51.160,00:10:52.030,极难采摘,,,
00:10:52.320,00:10:54.230,世间所有不过十余株,00:10:53.560,00:10:55.645,"There are hardly more than a dozen trees
of the kind in the world."
00:10:54.960,00:10:56.550,因常年得雪水滋养,,,
00:10:56.800,00:10:58.710,茶味清新冷冽 极是难得,00:10:56.022,00:11:00.000,"Nourished by the snow,
the tea has a refreshingly crisp taste."
00:10:59.360,00:11:00.500,王爷真是有心了,,,
00:11:01.240,00:11:01.830,小厦子,00:11:00.346,00:11:02.100,His Lordship is very devoted!
00:11:02.360,00:11:03.030,嗻,00:11:02.439,00:11:04.555,"- Xiao-Xiazi.
- Aye."
00:11:04.640,00:11:05.750,旁的也就罢了,,,
00:11:07.000,00:11:08.110,如今天气热,,,
00:11:08.920,00:11:11.630,这一路送来就得费尽心思,00:11:05.740,00:11:12.627,"Most impressively, it takes significant effort
to deliver the tea here safely in such hot weather."
00:11:12.000,00:11:13.750,倒是这心意难得,,,
00:11:14.000,00:11:15.310,皇上方才还说呢,00:11:12.929,00:11:15.038,The thought is rarer than the gift itself.
00:11:16.040,00:11:17.550,要就这一遭也罢了,,,
00:11:17.840,00:11:20.630,年年如此 可不太费了银子,00:11:15.038,00:11:21.536,"His Majesty was just saying how he would be
concerned about the costs if he received the tea every year."
00:11:21.320,00:11:24.710,王爷心思细巧 皇上却心怀大略,00:11:22.500,00:11:26.140,"While His Lordship is a thoughtful person,
Your Majesty thinks for the greater good."
00:11:25.600,00:11:26.550,莞贵人,,,
00:11:26.760,00:11:28.750,这句话可是说到点子上了,00:11:26.753,00:11:29.716,"Lady Sourire, you are right on point."
00:11:32.080,00:11:34.510,臣妾听闻 皇上适才与王爷射猎,,,
00:11:34.800,00:11:36.070,得了极好的彩头,00:11:33.020,00:11:37.136,"I heard that Your Majesty had just
completed a rewarding hunt with His Lordship."
00:11:36.440,00:11:38.310,怎的转眼就不见了王爷,,,
00:11:38.880,00:11:41.310,想必一定听说妹妹貌若天仙,00:11:37.400,00:11:39.860,I wonder why His Lordship has disappeared already.
00:11:41.680,00:11:43.270,赶紧走开避嫌去了,00:11:40.000,00:11:44.480,"Sourire, His Lordship must have heard of your supernal beauty,
so he has to avoid meeting you."
00:11:44.200,00:11:45.510,姐姐抬举臣妾了,00:11:45.200,00:11:47.220,I am immensely flattered.
00:11:46.880,00:11:48.510,皇上不必为王爷遮掩,00:11:47.979,00:11:50.300,Your Majesty need not cover up for His Lordship.
00:11:49.200,00:11:51.760,定是王爷听闻臣妾貌若无盐,00:11:50.300,00:11:53.100,"His Lordship must have known that
I look like Wuyan, the ugly woman of Qi."
00:11:52.080,00:11:53.910,怕受惊吓所以躲开了,00:11:53.100,00:11:55.340,So he left to dodge the fright.
00:11:54.720,00:11:58.910,你听听 她若是貌若无盐,00:11:55.743,00:11:57.043,Did you hear that?
00:11:59.800,00:12:02.670,那朕后宫诸人岂非,00:11:57.910,00:12:06.280,"If she looked like Wuyan, wouldn't my entire harem
be written as ugly women in history?"
00:12:03.000,00:12:04.990,尽成了东施丑妇一流,,,
00:12:05.880,00:12:08.990,莞妹妹谦虚 皇上听她玩笑呢,00:12:06.980,00:12:10.080,"Sourire said it in jest.
She was just being humble."
00:12:09.920,00:12:11.710,快尝尝这雪顶含翠吧,00:12:11.120,00:12:13.820,"Try some ""snow-topped jade""."
00:12:20.120,00:12:21.100,当真是好茶,,,
00:12:22.360,00:12:24.270,入口幽香 神清气爽,00:12:21.100,00:12:22.820,This is truly good tea.
00:12:24.720,00:12:26.350,十七爷果然有心了,00:12:23.660,00:12:25.880,It has a refreshing taste and subtle aroma.
,,,00:12:25.880,00:12:28.000,What a thoughtful gift from Lord XVII!
00:12:27.520,00:12:30.590,臣妾听闻 皇上当日初见莞贵人,00:12:28.677,00:12:31.940,"I was told that when Your Majesty first met Lady Sourire,"
00:12:31.120,00:12:32.390,为怕妹妹生疏了,,,
00:12:32.760,00:12:34.270,便假借十七爷之名,,,
00:12:34.520,00:12:35.910,与妹妹品箫谈琴,00:12:32.040,00:12:37.058,"you approached her using Lord XVII's name
and conversed with her about flute playing."
00:12:36.240,00:12:37.830,这才成就今日姻缘,,,
00:12:38.360,00:12:39.950,当真是一段佳话呢,00:12:37.058,00:12:41.189,"That was the start of your conjugal happiness today.
What a romantic tale in the palace."
00:12:41.440,00:12:43.790,这样的细微秘事姐姐也知晓,00:12:42.600,00:12:45.311,"Even such a delicate secret is know to you, Lady Cao."
00:12:44.800,00:12:45.940,定是皇上说的,00:12:45.877,00:12:47.520,You must have heard it from His Majesty.
00:12:46.880,00:12:47.750,朕可没说,00:12:47.973,00:12:49.614,I didn't say anything.
00:12:49.040,00:12:53.790,是琴默心细 自己留神听来的,00:12:50.254,00:12:55.052,Qinmo has an attentive ear and heard the story.
00:12:54.720,00:12:56.470,如此说来 这十七爷,,,
00:12:56.760,00:12:59.030,还是皇上与莞妹妹的媒人呢,00:12:55.882,00:13:00.605,"In that case, Lord XVII is the
matchmaker for Your Majesty and Sourire."
00:12:59.440,00:13:00.550,应该好好一谢,00:13:00.605,00:13:02.605,You should thank His Lordship.
00:13:01.920,00:13:04.430,何况这位大媒风流惆镜,00:13:03.138,00:13:05.878,"This Lord Matchmaker
is well-known for his unrestrained charm."
00:13:04.960,00:13:06.950,朝中多少官宦家的小姐,,,
00:13:07.360,00:13:10.030,都倾心不已 日夜得求亲近,00:13:06.180,00:13:11.356,"Many ladies from the distinguished families in court
admire and desire His Lordship."
00:13:11.000,00:13:14.070,妹妹 想必妹妹在闺阁之中,,,
00:13:14.440,00:13:16.390,也听闻过十七爷的盛名吧,00:13:12.261,00:13:17.783,"Sourire, I believe you must have heard of
His Lordship's name in your maiden years."
00:13:22.840,00:13:25.350,妹妹入宫前久居深闺,,,
00:13:26.160,00:13:28.270,入宫后又卧病不出,00:13:24.082,00:13:30.000,"Before I entered the palace, I spent my maiden years in seclusion,
and I was quarantined after entering the palace."
00:13:29.520,00:13:31.030,不曾听闻王爷大名,,,
00:13:31.480,00:13:32.670,真是孤陋寡闻了,00:13:30.619,00:13:34.419,"I had never heard about His Lordship.
How shallow and ignorant of me."
00:13:35.880,00:13:37.100,皇上文采风流,,,
00:13:38.120,00:13:39.750,又体贴咱们姐妹心思,00:13:37.020,00:13:41.280,"His Majesty possesses heavenly literary talents
and the most considerate mind towards the concubines."
00:13:40.600,00:13:42.980,不知当日是否也做此举,,,
00:13:43.360,00:13:44.470,来亲近姐姐芳泽呢,00:13:41.880,00:13:46.080,"I wonder if His Majesty did the same
when approaching your aroma and beauty, Lady Cao."
00:13:52.520,00:13:54.900,这个时辰想必温宜也该饿了,00:13:53.440,00:13:56.420,Wenyi must be feeling hungry at this hour.
00:13:56.120,00:13:58.550,皇上 臣妾先回去瞧瞧,00:13:56.835,00:14:00.000,Please allow me to leave and check on her.
00:13:59.760,00:14:00.470,也好,00:14:00.684,00:14:01.825,All right.
00:14:01.720,00:14:04.630,温宜病好了以后 老是哭闹不止,00:14:02.768,00:14:06.180,Wenyi is still crying a lot after she got better.
00:14:05.240,00:14:07.430,江太医常为你把平安脉,,,
00:14:08.320,00:14:10.350,也让他看看是什么缘故,00:14:06.482,00:14:11.643,"Ask Dr. Jiang to take a look
when he visits you for routine pulse-taking."
00:14:10.920,00:14:13.510,是 臣妾让江太医瞧过了,,,
00:14:13.760,00:14:14.740,再来禀报皇上,00:14:12.058,00:14:16.855,"Certainly, I will report to Your Majesty after Dr. Jiang visits."
00:14:40.720,00:14:44.750,这把琴是先帝舒妃的爱物,00:14:41.730,00:14:46.150,"This zither is a treasured item
of the prior emperor's Consort Serein."
00:14:46.040,00:14:49.390,你来之前朕本想听人弹奏一曲,00:14:47.055,00:14:51.100,I was craving for some zither music before you arrived.
00:14:50.200,00:14:53.110,可是曹贵人曹琴默人如其名,00:14:51.364,00:14:55.000,"But Lady Cao was just as apt as
her name Qinmo [a quiet lyre]."
00:14:54.320,00:14:56.390,在琴艺上甚是生疏,00:14:55.415,00:14:57.830,Her skills were quite rusty.
00:15:00.680,00:15:02.790,臣妾着人去请眉姐姐来吧,00:15:01.723,00:15:04.280,"Your Majesty, what about I send for Meizhuang?"
00:15:03.600,00:15:05.150,眉姐姐琴弹得极好,00:15:04.619,00:15:06.637,She is a brilliant zither player.
00:15:05.520,00:15:08.390,眉庄对于曲调的精通在你之上,00:15:06.637,00:15:10.018,"Meizhuang is more proficient in the craft than you are,"
00:15:09.880,00:15:12.590,可是她的曲中缺少情致,00:15:10.801,00:15:14.087,but her playing somewhat lacks emotions.
00:15:13.880,00:15:16.510,如此良琴若无情致,,,
00:15:17.480,00:15:19.310,岂不是索然无味,00:15:14.964,00:15:20.665,"Emotionless music, even played from
such a fine zither, is dull and insipid."
00:15:20.880,00:15:23.180,还是你给朕弹奏一曲吧,00:15:22.100,00:15:24.920,Will you play the zither for me?
00:15:24.720,00:15:27.280,那臣妾就为皇上弹奏一曲,00:15:26.000,00:15:28.736,"With pleasure, Your Majesty."
00:15:44.000,00:15:46.630,果然是极好的琴 音色如此清脆,00:15:45.140,00:15:48.380,"What an excellent instrument!
The sound is so crisp and clear."
00:15:54.280,00:15:57.820,碧波清风 品茶听琴,00:15:55.326,00:15:59.600,"The jade-colored water and tea;
the refreshing breeze and zither playing."
00:15:58.680,00:16:00.590,果然是人生乐事,00:15:59.900,00:16:02.374,Such is a pleasure of life.
00:16:02.320,00:16:05.310,就弹那半闺 山居吟 吧,00:16:03.340,00:16:06.960,Let's hear the first verse of Ode to Mountain Living.
00:16:27.560,00:16:28.620,臣妾弹得不好,00:16:28.620,00:16:30.220,My playing was inept.
00:16:29.840,00:16:31.190,还请皇上不要见笑,00:16:30.700,00:16:33.000,I hope I did not incur Your Majesty's ridicule.
00:16:31.760,00:16:35.300,琴音精妙 只是你心有旁鹜,00:16:33.000,00:16:36.760,"Your playing was exquisite.
It's just that you were distracted."
00:16:36.680,00:16:39.240,心思没有全然付与此琴,00:16:38.000,00:16:41.060,You did not devote your whole heart to the zither.
00:16:41.400,00:16:44.710,臣妾辜负此琴 还请皇上恕罪,00:16:42.500,00:16:46.120,"I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness
for my failure to commit to the zither."
00:16:45.240,00:16:46.750,你初次弹这把琴,,,
00:16:47.040,00:16:48.590,难免生疏不能投入,00:16:46.274,00:16:50.320,"It was your first time playing the zither.
I understand that you were unacquainted with it."
00:16:52.400,00:16:55.350,不过朕倒另有一个疑惑,00:16:53.500,00:16:56.800,But I have another question in mind.
00:16:56.960,00:16:59.870,你对朕的情意朕已经明了,00:16:58.140,00:17:01.640,Your affection for me - I can clearly perceive.
00:17:01.600,00:17:03.070,只是朕想知道,,,
00:17:03.720,00:17:06.020,你是何时对朕有情的,00:17:02.880,00:17:07.700,But I want to know when you began to have feelings for me.
00:17:14.760,00:17:18.350,臣妾看见的是臣妾面前的这个人,00:17:16.000,00:17:19.601,What I see is the person sitting before me
00:17:19.560,00:17:20.910,无关名分与称呼,,,
00:17:21.400,00:17:22.190,怎么说,00:17:20.664,00:17:22.664,regardless of his name or title.
00:17:24.200,00:17:25.790,皇上借果郡王之名,00:17:22.840,00:17:24.051,What do you mean?
00:17:26.240,00:17:27.710,与臣妾品箫赏花,00:17:25.264,00:17:30.100,"When Your Majesty used the name of Noble Prince Guo
to discuss music with me in the garden,"
00:17:29.160,00:17:31.030,臣妾虽感慕皇上才华,,,
00:17:32.040,00:17:33.590,但一心以为您是王爷,00:17:30.280,00:17:33.222,"although I admired your knowledge and flair,"
00:17:34.280,00:17:35.550,所以处处谨慎,,,
00:17:35.880,00:17:37.630,不敢越了规矩多加亲近,00:17:33.222,00:17:38.919,"I kept a respectful distance and behaved with proprieties
knowing that you were a lord."
00:17:39.200,00:17:40.750,皇上表明身份之后,,,
00:17:41.160,00:17:42.550,对臣妾多加照拂,00:17:40.480,00:17:43.940,"After Your Majesty revealed your identity,
you showed generous care for me"
00:17:43.280,00:17:45.230,并非只是对其他妃嫔一般对待,00:17:44.302,00:17:47.306,and treated me differently from the other concubines.
00:17:46.680,00:17:49.590,臣妾对皇上不只是君臣之礼,,,
00:17:50.240,00:17:51.270,更有夫妻之情,00:17:48.020,00:17:52.714,"That is why I not only see Your Majesty
as my monarch, but also as my husband."
00:17:54.440,00:17:55.470,若真要追究,,,
00:17:56.240,00:17:58.190,臣妾是何时对皇上动情的,00:17:55.700,00:17:59.540,"If I must tell Your Majesty the exact time,"
00:17:59.960,00:18:01.270,臣妾对皇上动心,,,
00:18:02.160,00:18:05.030,是在皇上解余氏之困之时,00:18:00.800,00:18:06.540,"it was when Your Majesty helped me
when I was cornered by Yu in the garden."
00:18:06.480,00:18:07.950,臣妾当时手足无措,,,
00:18:08.960,00:18:11.230,虽然这对您来讲只是举手之劳,00:18:07.600,00:18:09.800,I was shocked and flustered at that moment.
00:18:12.160,00:18:13.430,可在臣妾眼里,00:18:10.000,00:18:13.140,"While it was as easy as lifting a finger for Your Majesty,"
00:18:14.000,00:18:16.590,皇上是救人于危困的君子,00:18:13.620,00:18:17.834,"in my eyes, Your Majesty was the Noble Man
who rescued me from distress."
00:18:26.640,00:18:29.150,朕不过是随口一问罢了,00:18:27.839,00:18:30.740,I was just asking casually.
00:18:29.640,00:18:31.030,请皇上容臣妾说完,00:18:30.740,00:18:32.780,I hope Your Majesty will allow me to finish.
00:18:33.440,00:18:36.030,臣妾死罪 说句冒犯皇上的话,00:18:34.460,00:18:37.720,Saying this may be a capital offense to Your Majesty:
00:18:37.160,00:18:39.510,臣妾敬重您是君,00:18:38.281,00:18:41.012,"I do revere you as my monarch,"
00:18:41.440,00:18:42.580,但更把皇上,,,
00:18:43.520,00:18:45.550,视作臣妾的夫君来爱重,00:18:42.747,00:18:47.171,"but even above that, I regard you as my loving husband."
00:18:53.200,00:18:55.760,朕何尝不知道你的心思,00:18:54.511,00:18:57.551,I have always known your feelings.
00:18:56.920,00:18:58.630,所以朕才爱重你,00:18:58.193,00:19:00.160,That is why I hold you dear to my heart.
00:18:59.720,00:19:03.870,嬛嬛 今日的事是朕多疑了,00:19:00.801,00:19:05.280,"Huan Huan, I was overly suspicious today."
00:19:04.760,00:19:06.510,你不要怪朕,00:19:06.877,00:19:08.500,Don't blame me.
00:19:21.560,00:19:22.310,四郎,00:19:22.560,00:19:24.020,Si Lang.
00:19:27.720,00:19:29.230,小主是不是疑心有人,,,
00:19:29.520,00:19:31.070,把小主与皇上当年的私事,,,
00:19:31.920,00:19:33.110,告诉了曹贵人,00:19:30.000,00:19:34.500,"My Lady, do you suspect that someone revealed
your secret to Lady Cao?"
00:19:33.880,00:19:35.230,我也只是这么猜着,,,
00:19:35.680,00:19:36.660,并没有什么证据,00:19:35.111,00:19:38.031,"It is only a suspicion that I have.
I have no evidence."
00:19:39.280,00:19:40.420,可是这种事,,,
00:19:41.040,00:19:43.150,只有和小主最亲近的人才知道,00:19:40.358,00:19:44.520,"But only people who are closest to you
would know this story."
00:19:43.720,00:19:45.830,连奴婢也是今天才得知此事,00:19:44.859,00:19:47.550,I wasn't aware of it until today.
00:19:47.000,00:19:49.030,想来当日亲见此事的,,,
00:19:49.360,00:19:50.500,只有流朱姑娘一人,00:19:48.440,00:19:51.680,I believe Vermilion was the only witness in the garden.
00:19:51.840,00:19:52.950,可是流朱姑娘,,,
00:19:53.480,00:19:55.940,是小主从娘家带来的陪嫁丫头啊,00:19:53.154,00:19:56.974,"But she is a dowry maid of yours, My Lady."
00:19:56.160,00:19:56.990,我知道,,,
00:19:58.240,00:19:59.870,可是流朱跟了我这么多年,00:19:57.149,00:19:58.549,I know.
00:20:00.520,00:20:02.820,我是信得过的 是啊,00:19:59.479,00:20:02.900,"But Vermilion has been with me for so many years.
I have confidence in her."
00:20:03.160,00:20:04.790,她绝不会与曹琴默牵连在一起,00:20:03.315,00:20:04.360,Indeed.
00:20:05.160,00:20:06.140,来出卖我,00:20:04.360,00:20:07.440,She would never collude with Cao Qinmo against me.
00:20:07.520,00:20:08.550,奴婢也这么想,00:20:08.740,00:20:10.411,"I agree, My Lady."
00:20:09.480,00:20:12.790,莫非是流朱姑娘心直口快,,,
00:20:13.240,00:20:14.910,一不小心说与了旁人听,00:20:10.600,00:20:16.260,"Vermilion... is quick-tongued.
She might have carelessly mentioned it to someone else."
00:20:15.800,00:20:18.260,而说者无心听者有意,00:20:17.340,00:20:19.760,But her unintentional words fell on a purposeful ear
00:20:18.880,00:20:20.310,就这样口耳相传的,,,
00:20:20.960,00:20:22.710,传到了曹琴默耳朵里,00:20:19.760,00:20:23.807,and consenquently were passed on to Lady Cao.
00:20:23.880,00:20:27.230,思来想去 也只有这个解释了,00:20:25.300,00:20:28.860,That might be the only way to explain it.
00:20:29.400,00:20:30.870,幸好皇上信任我,,,
00:20:31.640,00:20:32.830,否则三人成虎,00:20:30.594,00:20:32.574,It was fortunate that His Majesty trusted me.
00:20:33.440,00:20:36.310,我恐怕要死无葬身之地了,00:20:32.800,00:20:37.800,"""The rumor of a tiger spread three times is more dangerous
than the tiger itself."""
00:20:36.960,00:20:38.070,的确如此,,,
00:20:39.080,00:20:40.220,旁的不要紧,00:20:37.989,00:20:39.700,That is true.
00:20:40.840,00:20:42.950,只要皇上信得小主就好,00:20:40.290,00:20:44.770,"You've earned His Majesty's trust.
That is more important than anything else."

00:20:55.520,00:20:58.230,娘娘 奴婢已经按照您的吩咐,,,
00:20:58.600,00:21:01.060,让御膳房减少各宫各院的例菜,00:20:56.300,00:21:02.640,"At Your Majesty's behest, I have instructed the
Imperial Kitchen to reduce the food ration for every palace"
00:21:01.560,00:21:02.990,并且多用素菜,00:21:02.640,00:21:04.584,and use more vegetables instead of meat.
00:21:03.240,00:21:06.830,好啊 皇上要后宫节俭,,,
00:21:07.360,00:21:09.150,本宫尤其要做出表率,00:21:04.584,00:21:10.540,"Very well. I must set an example
as His Majesty requires frugality in the harem."
00:21:09.720,00:21:10.430,是,00:21:10.729,00:21:11.754,Certainly.
00:21:12.040,00:21:14.550,华妃和齐妃位分高,00:21:13.000,00:21:15.680,Consort Fleur and Consort Astuce are high in rank -
00:21:14.840,00:21:16.030,都要和本宫一样,,,
00:21:16.320,00:21:18.700,其他妃嫔才会心服口服的,00:21:15.680,00:21:17.500,they have to do the same
00:21:19.200,00:21:20.070,娘娘英明,00:21:17.680,00:21:20.200,so that the other concubines will readily follow suit.
00:21:20.840,00:21:22.060,不是本宫英明,00:21:20.351,00:21:21.731,Your Majesty is wise.
00:21:22.600,00:21:23.630,例菜减半的主意,00:21:21.800,00:21:23.600,It was not my wisdom.
00:21:23.960,00:21:25.710,是沈贵人在皇上跟前儿提的,00:21:23.600,00:21:26.980,"It was Lady Shen who proposed the idea
to cut the ration before His Majesty."
00:21:26.240,00:21:27.870,这份功劳和苦心,,,
00:21:28.240,00:21:29.870,本宫可不能抢了她的,00:21:27.319,00:21:31.131,I must not take credit for her thought and effort.
00:21:40.720,00:21:41.390,娘娘,,,
00:21:41.800,00:21:44.360,奴婢从御膳房拿了点心来了,00:21:41.940,00:21:45.600,"Your Highness, I brought you
some desserts from the Imperial Kitchen."
00:21:47.600,00:21:48.990,东西少就罢了,,,
00:21:49.480,00:21:51.590,怎么本宫喜欢的蟹粉酥都没有啊,00:21:48.700,00:21:50.400,"It's one thing to have fewer desserts,"
00:21:52.120,00:21:54.710,御膳房的人说蟹粉贵得很,00:21:50.400,00:21:53.366,but why didn't they prepare the crab puffs that I like?
00:21:55.040,00:21:56.310,如今皇后下旨,00:21:53.366,00:21:56.200,The kitchen staff said that crab powder is very expensive.
00:21:56.680,00:21:58.670,不许再用这些贵价的点心了,00:21:56.200,00:22:00.040,"The Empress has decreed that
they stop making such pricey desserts."
00:21:59.600,00:22:01.430,每日的例菜减半不说,00:22:00.689,00:22:02.740,"Not only has she halved the daily ration,"
00:22:01.680,00:22:03.270,连点心都这么小家子气,00:22:02.740,00:22:04.880,she's even so stingy about the desserts?
00:22:05.240,00:22:06.380,娘娘不要生气,,,
00:22:06.680,00:22:09.030,行宫不比宫里什么都齐全,00:22:06.192,00:22:07.840,"Your Highness, please don't be mad."
00:22:09.320,00:22:10.670,皇后从来就小气,00:22:07.840,00:22:10.300,The Summer Palace is not as well-provided as the Forbidden City.
00:22:11.320,00:22:12.710,宫里就这么几个人,00:22:10.300,00:22:12.100,The Empress is always stingy.
00:22:13.360,00:22:14.580,能有多大的花销,00:22:12.426,00:22:14.220,You can count the concubines here on one hand.
00:22:15.880,00:22:17.750,午膳晚膳全是素菜,00:22:14.409,00:22:16.389,How much can we possibly expend?
00:22:18.080,00:22:19.710,什么醋黄瓜 凉拌金针,00:22:16.960,00:22:18.820,Our lunch and dinner are both vegetarian now.
00:22:20.040,00:22:21.230,恨不得荤腥都不见,00:22:19.120,00:22:21.040,A needle mushroom salad after pickled cucumbers.
00:22:22.280,00:22:24.230,本来夏天胃口就不好,00:22:21.040,00:22:23.060,Not a single dish even looked like meat!
00:22:24.920,00:22:26.870,没些个好东西 更不用吃了,00:22:23.607,00:22:26.047,My appetite is already ruined by the summer heat.
,,,00:22:26.349,00:22:28.449,There's no point in eating at all!
00:22:27.880,00:22:30.510,奴婢听说皇后宫里也是这样的,00:22:29.129,00:22:32.109,I learned that it is the same in the Empress's palace.
00:22:33.680,00:22:35.070,都是那个沈贵人的主意,,,
00:22:35.440,00:22:37.630,劝了皇上要裁减例菜呢,00:22:34.900,00:22:38.960,"It was all Lady Shen's idea. She suggested
to His Majesty that we halve the food ration."
00:22:39.520,00:22:41.110,还没协理六宫呢,,,
00:22:41.680,00:22:43.830,就学会拿着鸡毛当令箭了,00:22:40.820,00:22:45.300,"She's not yet managing the palace affairs,

00:22:50.280,00:22:51.710,各宫都吃得苦,00:22:49.100,00:22:50.507,Distribute some money among the servants.
00:22:52.160,00:22:55.990,给那些宫女太监们补贴点油水,00:22:51.450,00:22:57.440,"Now that every palace is on a budget,
the servants will appreciate additional provisions."

00:23:17.400,00:23:19.780,我觉得不错 比御膳房的要好,00:23:16.100,00:23:21.060,"Lunar made me this new sour prune soup.
It tastes better than what the Imperial Kitchen makes."
00:23:20.200,00:23:21.110,你也快尝尝,00:23:21.249,00:23:22.749,You should try some!
00:23:22.200,00:23:24.910,姐姐忘了 我是不爱吃酸的,00:23:23.300,00:23:26.500,"You forgot that I don't like sour food, didn't you?"
00:23:26.000,00:23:27.060,瞧我这记性,,,
00:23:27.760,00:23:29.470,那妹妹的我就先喝了,00:23:26.661,00:23:28.440,"Oh, my poor memory."
00:23:30.520,00:23:32.150,小主睡前就喝了四五碗,00:23:28.817,00:23:31.018,"In that case, I'll have yours."
00:23:32.520,00:23:33.270,仔细伤胃,00:23:31.700,00:23:34.740,"My Lady, you've had four or five servings already.
It might cause stomach pain."
00:23:35.920,00:23:36.670,那也罢了,,,
00:23:37.160,00:23:39.460,但今天热 我就爱喝这个,00:23:36.760,00:23:38.220,All right then.
00:23:40.240,00:23:41.870,那是茯苓的酸梅汤做得好,00:23:38.220,00:23:40.900,I just couldn't help drinking it on a hot day.
00:23:42.440,00:23:43.310,茯苓是谁,00:23:41.400,00:23:43.460,Poria is very good at making prune soup.
00:23:43.640,00:23:44.910,是行宫里的小宫女,00:23:43.460,00:23:44.720,Who is Poria?
00:23:45.200,00:23:46.310,拨来伺候小主的,00:23:44.720,00:23:47.560,"She's a maid in the Summer Palace.
She was sent to serve My Lady."
00:23:47.240,00:23:47.790,对了,,,
00:23:48.000,00:23:50.110,温宜公主下个月十九满周岁,00:23:48.500,00:23:51.540,"Princess Wenyi will have her
first birthday on the 19th of next month."
00:23:50.440,00:23:53.550,皇上嘱咐了皇后要好生热闹一番,00:23:51.729,00:23:54.785,"His Majesty has asked the Empress
to hold a grand celebration for her."
00:23:54.680,00:23:55.900,皇上喜欢温宜,,,
00:23:56.320,00:23:57.910,难免多见曹贵人几次,00:23:55.880,00:23:59.380,"His Majesty has been seeing Lady Cao
more lately because of Wenyi."
00:23:58.600,00:24:00.470,华妃的事没有牵连到她,,,
00:24:00.840,00:24:02.030,她反而更得意了,00:23:59.757,00:24:03.262,"The incident with Consort Fleur did not affect her
so she has seemed more confident recently."
00:24:02.480,00:24:06.070,是啊 前儿的事我也听说了,00:24:03.678,00:24:07.418,"Yes, I heard about what happened two days ago."
00:24:06.680,00:24:09.270,这个人几句话就能挑到要害,,,
00:24:09.600,00:24:12.510,让皇上疑心你 不可小觑,00:24:07.984,00:24:13.880,"She aroused suspicion in His Majesty with just a few words.
She's not someone to be underestimated."
00:24:13.800,00:24:16.180,幸好皇上没再说什么,00:24:14.860,00:24:17.614,"Fortunately, His Majesty didn't bring it up again."
00:24:18.840,00:24:21.550,任凭眼前皇上怎么宠爱咱们,,,
00:24:22.080,00:24:24.830,没有子嗣终究也是不稳固的,00:24:20.000,00:24:25.938,"No matter what place we hold His Majesty's favor at present,
it is not secure until we produce an heir."
00:24:25.600,00:24:27.750,你且看华妃就知道,,,
00:24:28.040,00:24:29.470,纵然她纵横六宫,00:24:27.000,00:24:29.000,Consort Fleur is one good example.
00:24:29.800,00:24:30.780,可没有子嗣,,,
00:24:31.040,00:24:33.710,这手上的权势说没也就没有了,00:24:29.000,00:24:34.940,"Even though she was dominant in the harem,
she was deprived of her authority overnight."
00:24:34.240,00:24:36.270,没有个实实在在的孩子,,,
00:24:36.640,00:24:38.550,到底说什么也是空的,00:24:35.355,00:24:40.000,"Without a child in your arms, everything else is futile in the palace."
00:24:39.080,00:24:40.470,姐姐和她不一样,00:24:40.453,00:24:42.256,You are different from them.
00:24:44.480,00:24:46.230,我倒真是和她们不一样,,,
00:24:47.240,00:24:49.510,皇上再怎么不待见齐妃,00:24:45.679,00:24:48.460,"Indeed, I am different from them."
00:24:50.160,00:24:52.870,为了三阿哥 也得和她过过话,00:24:48.500,00:24:54.220,"His Majesty dislikes Consort Astuce but still
talks to her for the sake of the Third Prince."
00:24:53.320,00:24:56.030,曹贵人和欣常在虽说是女儿,,,
00:24:56.720,00:24:58.510,可皇上也一样疼爱,00:24:54.300,00:24:59.760,"Same with Lady Cao and Attendant Joie.
His Majesty adores their daughters just as dearly."
00:24:59.240,00:25:00.790,只要记挂着孩子,,,
00:25:01.120,00:25:02.340,就会顾惜到生母,00:25:00.480,00:25:03.780,"As long as His Majesty cares for the child,
the mother will also be cherished."
00:25:03.200,00:25:06.740,如若不然 皇上过了一时的兴致,,,
00:25:07.080,00:25:08.590,总会抛到一边的,00:25:04.760,00:25:09.749,"Otherwise, a concubine will be forgotten after
the His Majesty's affection fades and vanishes."
00:25:12.280,00:25:13.630,仔细算来,,,
00:25:14.240,00:25:17.390,姐姐服侍皇上也快有一年了,00:25:13.620,00:25:18.800,"By my calculations, it has been almost a year
since your first service to His Majesty."
00:25:18.240,00:25:21.510,怎么还不见好消息呢,00:25:19.469,00:25:23.029,I wonder ... why we still haven't heard the good news.
00:25:23.520,00:25:26.390,皇上一个月才到后宫几次啊,00:25:24.624,00:25:27.760,His Majesty hardly visits the harem.
00:25:27.200,00:25:30.310,如今我帮着皇后娘娘料理琐事,,,
00:25:30.640,00:25:31.830,越发顾不得了,00:25:28.100,00:25:33.260,"Now that I'm helping Her Majesty with the palace affairs.
I have even less time to myself."
00:25:34.640,00:25:37.870,说到底也是我福薄吧,00:25:35.832,00:25:38.980,I suppose I must lack Heaven's blessings.
00:25:39.160,00:25:40.270,什么福薄,00:25:39.131,00:25:41.851,"Nonsense, it has nothing to do with that."
00:25:41.160,00:25:43.670,当初华妃盛宠 还不是没有身孕,00:25:42.389,00:25:45.818,"Consort Fleur was in high favor
even though she never had a child."
00:25:44.640,00:25:45.950,况且我们还年轻,,,
00:25:46.320,00:25:47.540,以后日子还长着呢,00:25:45.818,00:25:49.680,"We're still young, there's plenty of time ahead."
00:25:48.320,00:25:50.510,以后我们必定会儿孙满堂,,,
00:25:50.840,00:25:51.550,承欢膝下,00:25:49.680,00:25:53.020,We'll certainly have many children to fill the rooms with joy.
00:25:52.120,00:25:53.180,姐姐放心吧,00:25:53.171,00:25:55.051,"Put your mind at ease, Meizhuang."
00:25:54.320,00:25:56.780,我不怕和你说句掏心窝子的话,00:25:55.480,00:25:58.079,Can I talk to you heart-to-heart?
00:25:57.280,00:25:59.840,虽说诞育龙裔要靠天意,00:25:58.461,00:26:01.563,"Although conceiving Heaven's heir depends on the will of Heaven,"
00:26:00.400,00:26:03.070,但是谋事在人 成事在天,00:26:01.563,00:26:04.056,"""people propose while Heaven disposes."""
00:26:03.680,00:26:07.300,你我也得要点人为才是,00:26:05.074,00:26:08.338,There is something... we can work on.
00:26:10.200,00:26:12.760,这左右就是皇上来与不来,00:26:11.480,00:26:14.145,All that matters is whether His Majesty visits...
00:26:13.880,00:26:15.310,还能有什么人为的呢,00:26:15.050,00:26:16.792,What is there for us to do?
00:26:24.400,00:26:25.430,这位太医是,,,
00:26:26.360,00:26:27.630,江大人回家守丧,00:26:25.620,00:26:27.219,"May I help you, doctor?"
00:26:27.840,00:26:29.470,太医院特派微臣刘畚,,,
00:26:29.800,00:26:31.550,来向沈贵人请平安脉,00:26:27.500,00:26:33.220,"My name is Liu Ben. I'm here for the routine pulse-taking
because Dr. Jiang is away for a family funeral."
00:26:32.760,00:26:35.060,莞贵人在里头 刘太医稍等片刻,,,
00:26:35.280,00:26:35.910,好,00:26:34.000,00:26:36.660,"Dr. Liu, I hope you won't mind waiting for a while.
My Lady is talking to Lady Sourire."
,,,00:26:36.660,00:26:38.020,Certainly.
00:26:45.280,00:26:47.030,你看 我软硬兼施,,,
00:26:47.320,00:26:49.350,才让江太医给我开了这张方子,00:26:46.500,00:26:50.700,"I used both soft and hard tactics to finally get
Dr. Jiang agree to give me this prescription."
00:26:50.080,00:26:53.070,照着方子调养一定会得男孩,00:26:51.340,00:26:54.380,"Following his instructions,
the conception of a boy is guaranteed."
00:26:53.400,00:26:55.390,你也快拿去照方调养吧,00:26:54.569,00:26:56.845,You should take the prescription as well.
00:26:58.120,00:26:59.390,是哪个江太医啊,,,
00:26:59.920,00:27:01.230,还有哪个江太医呀,00:26:59.232,00:27:00.700,Who is this Dr. Jiang?
,,,00:27:00.700,00:27:02.700,Who else can it be?
00:27:01.560,00:27:05.100,就是妇产千金一科最拿手的江诚,00:27:02.800,00:27:06.480,Dr. Jiang Cheng. He's an expert in gynecology.
00:27:06.240,00:27:07.150,江诚,,,
00:27:08.360,00:27:09.310,他弟弟江慎,00:27:07.466,00:27:08.920,Jiang Cheng?
00:27:09.520,00:27:11.190,是照顾曹贵人母女的太医,00:27:09.453,00:27:12.640,"His younger brother, Jiang Shen,
is the doctor of Lady Cao and her daughter."
00:27:11.640,00:27:12.310,不错,,,
00:27:13.920,00:27:15.230,这方子可不可信啊,00:27:12.791,00:27:13.851,Exactly.
00:27:15.680,00:27:16.470,你放心,00:27:15.000,00:27:16.603,Can we trust his prescription?
00:27:16.840,00:27:19.220,我呀 也是放心不过,00:27:16.829,00:27:18.120,Don't worry.
00:27:19.480,00:27:21.780,才派很多人去调查他的底细,00:27:18.120,00:27:23.080,"I wasn't sure about him and sent many people
to investigate his background extensively."
00:27:22.440,00:27:25.870,原来这江诚和江慎并非一母所生,,,
00:27:26.320,00:27:28.430,他们的母亲不睦已久,00:27:23.500,00:27:29.640,"Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen are half-brothers
and their mothers are on competitive terms."
00:27:28.680,00:27:30.670,兄弟俩也是势如水火,00:27:29.829,00:27:32.160,So the two brothers also clash like fire and water.
00:27:31.160,00:27:32.950,要不我怎么敢用他,00:27:32.160,00:27:34.460,That is why I trust him.
00:27:33.640,00:27:34.620,你放心用吧,,,
00:27:34.960,00:27:36.510,我也是翻看了很多医书,00:27:34.724,00:27:36.120,Rest assured and use it.
00:27:36.760,00:27:38.350,才决定用这张方子的,00:27:36.120,00:27:39.740,"I also read many medical books
before I decided to use his prescription."
00:27:39.120,00:27:40.180,我总觉得不妥,,,
00:27:41.880,00:27:43.100,你先把方子收起来,00:27:40.151,00:27:41.909,But I can't help feeling skeptical.
00:27:43.640,00:27:44.950,等下问过温太医再用,00:27:43.024,00:27:46.400,"Put the prescription aside for now.
Wait until you've asked Dr. Wen."
00:27:45.880,00:27:47.710,流朱 你去太医院看看,,,
00:27:48.120,00:27:49.180,看看温大人在不在,00:27:47.100,00:27:50.400,"Vermilion, can you make the trip
to see if Dr. Wen is on shift today?"
00:27:49.400,00:27:50.910,若是在 请他即刻过来,,,
00:27:51.320,00:27:52.270,小主不知道,00:27:50.400,00:27:52.340,"If so, bring him here right away."
00:27:52.520,00:27:53.910,护国公孙老公爷病重,,,
00:27:54.280,00:27:55.260,温大人应诊去了,00:27:52.340,00:27:56.560,"My Lady, Lord Protector Sun is gravely ill.
Dr. Wen was sent away to attend to him."
00:27:55.640,00:27:57.270,说是一应吃住全在孙府,,,
00:27:57.640,00:27:58.830,等孙老公爷病愈了,,,
00:27:59.240,00:28:00.430,温大人才会回来呢,00:27:56.800,00:28:01.574,"He will stay there day and night
and won't return until Lord Sun recovers."
00:28:00.920,00:28:01.870,他什么时候去的,,,
00:28:02.520,00:28:03.350,就昨儿午后,00:28:01.800,00:28:03.340,When did Dr. Wen go?
00:28:03.680,00:28:04.900,孙老公爷病得突然,00:28:03.679,00:28:04.780,Yesterday afternoon.
00:28:05.120,00:28:06.830,所以温大人走得也急,00:28:04.780,00:28:08.160,"Dr. Wen left on short notice
because it was an emergency."
00:28:07.520,00:28:08.580,真是太不巧了,,,
00:28:09.160,00:28:10.070,算了,00:28:08.500,00:28:10.260,How unfortunate!
00:28:10.280,00:28:12.390,这药我已经吃过两回了,00:28:10.260,00:28:13.560,Don't worry about it. I've had two doses already.
00:28:12.720,00:28:13.630,我觉着还不错,,,
00:28:14.320,00:28:16.110,你就不用兴师动众的了,00:28:13.560,00:28:15.200,I trust it is fine.
00:28:16.480,00:28:18.150,咱们还大老远请什么温大人啊,00:28:15.300,00:28:17.460,You don't need to summon a brigade for it.
00:28:18.520,00:28:19.150,我刚才瞧,00:28:17.611,00:28:19.551,We don't need to bring Dr. Wen all the way here.
00:28:19.600,00:28:21.350,院子里现成站着一太医呢,00:28:19.551,00:28:22.620,I see a doctor is waiting in the courtyard.
00:28:32.560,00:28:34.230,如今有太医来 我就不打扰了,,,
00:28:34.840,00:28:35.820,明儿再来看你,00:28:33.777,00:28:35.800,I shall go now since a doctor is visiting you.
00:28:38.000,00:28:38.710,流朱,00:28:35.900,00:28:37.300,I'll see you tomorrow.
00:28:40.640,00:28:41.990,奴才给主子请安,00:28:39.200,00:28:40.820,Vermilion.
00:28:49.560,00:28:51.710,小臣给小主请安,00:28:41.980,00:28:43.700,Your servant bows in respect before Mistress.
00:28:52.400,00:28:54.510,这位太医看着眼生得很,00:28:50.700,00:28:53.560,The humble doctor bows in respect before My Lady.
00:28:54.960,00:28:56.710,以前好像没有见过,00:28:53.560,00:28:58.000,"This doctor looks very new to the eye.
I don't remember seeing you before."
00:28:57.880,00:29:00.260,微臣是第一次伺候小主脉象,00:28:59.080,00:29:01.740,"This is my first visit to you, My Lady."
00:29:01.040,00:29:03.990,听说话像是济州口音,00:29:01.900,00:29:05.480,You seem to have a Jizhou accent.
00:29:04.640,00:29:05.860,微臣是前几日,,,
00:29:06.120,00:29:07.710,刚从济州任上调来的,00:29:05.895,00:29:08.993,I was transferred from Jizhou just a few days ago.
00:29:09.520,00:29:12.510,这倒难得 我也是济州人,00:29:10.604,00:29:13.960,"What serendipity.
I'm from Jizhou as well."
00:29:13.480,00:29:15.670,微臣竟有这等福气,00:29:14.700,00:29:17.440,"I feel deeply honored, My Lady."
00:29:18.040,00:29:20.110,茯苓 去斟壶龙井来,00:29:19.180,00:29:21.680,"Poria, brew a pot of Dragon Well tea."
00:29:20.520,00:29:21.190,是,00:29:21.680,00:29:22.840,Yes.
00:29:25.080,00:29:28.230,再过半月就是温宜公主的生辰了,00:29:26.520,00:29:29.460,Princess Wenyi will be one year old in half a month.
00:29:28.520,00:29:29.790,宫里孩子不多,,,
00:29:30.400,00:29:33.670,满周岁的日子自然要好好地庆祝,00:29:29.460,00:29:35.060,"We don't have many children in the palace.
The first birth anniversary is worth a grand celebration."
00:29:34.200,00:29:37.030,皇上的意思是虽不在宫里头,,,
00:29:37.600,00:29:39.110,但也不能从简,00:29:35.475,00:29:40.835,"Although we are in the Summer Palace,
His Majesty wishes not to simplify the ceremony."
00:29:39.720,00:29:42.070,一定要把它办得热闹才是,00:29:40.986,00:29:42.986,We must make it lively and memorable.
00:29:42.920,00:29:43.830,这件事呢,,,
00:29:44.080,00:29:46.030,已经交代了内务府去办了,00:29:44.171,00:29:47.251,"I have instructed the Household Department
to prepare for the occasion."
00:29:50.280,00:29:51.790,谢皇上 皇后,,,
00:29:52.080,00:29:54.190,臣妾与公主感激不尽,00:29:51.560,00:29:53.380,I thank Your Majesties.
00:29:55.560,00:29:57.270,你为皇上诞下龙裔,00:29:53.380,00:29:55.880,Wenyi and I are eternally thankful.
00:29:57.520,00:29:59.750,乃是有功之人 不用说谢,00:29:56.660,00:30:01.140,"Producing an heir is a contribution to the imperial family.
There's no need to thank us."
00:30:01.240,00:30:03.910,子孙繁盛乃是社稷之福,00:30:02.200,00:30:05.280,Having many imperial heirs is a blessing for all under Heaven.
00:30:04.200,00:30:06.350,皇上膝下龙裔又不多,00:30:05.280,00:30:08.195,His Majesty doesn't have many children.
00:30:07.040,00:30:08.550,还请各位妹妹,,,
00:30:08.960,00:30:11.260,要为皇上分忧才是啊,00:30:08.195,00:30:12.400,I hope every one of you can ease the worry of His Majesty.
00:30:12.360,00:30:13.910,是 皇后娘娘,00:30:13.960,00:30:15.481,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:30:14.200,00:30:17.310,龙裔原是不多 可到了这儿,,,
00:30:17.760,00:30:19.870,不是现成就多了一个吗,00:30:15.481,00:30:20.981,"Although we don't have many imperial heirs,
we do get one more whenever we come to the Summer Palace."
00:30:21.080,00:30:24.190,华妃 你可别犯了忌讳,00:30:22.311,00:30:25.474,"Consort Fleur, don't speak of such a taboo subject."
00:30:26.640,00:30:30.230,人人都忌讳 本宫却不忌讳,00:30:27.640,00:30:31.760,I don't care if that's a taboo to anyone.
00:30:32.280,00:30:35.820,奴婢生的孩子也配做龙裔吗,00:30:33.439,00:30:37.380,"How can the son of a humble maid
be counted as an imperial heir?"
00:30:36.680,00:30:39.190,四阿哥的亲生母亲是贱婢不假,00:30:37.980,00:30:40.960,"While the mother of the Fourth Prince was a humble maid,"
00:30:39.800,00:30:43.420,可是皇上的孩子就是皇上的孩子,00:30:40.960,00:30:44.680,he is still the son of His Majesty
00:30:44.000,00:30:46.590,同样是三阿哥的亲兄弟,00:30:45.290,00:30:47.920,and equally the brother of the Third Prince.
00:30:47.800,00:30:48.670,他也配,00:30:48.300,00:30:50.380,Ha. Equal?
00:30:49.600,00:30:52.670,好了 好端端地说这些干吗,00:30:50.774,00:30:54.274,All right. Why did you bring this up out of nowhere?
00:30:53.400,00:30:55.550,大家都是皇上身边的老人儿了,00:30:54.500,00:30:57.380,We all have been serving His Majesty for a long time.
00:30:56.400,00:30:58.550,即便不在乎宫里的忌讳,,,
00:30:58.760,00:31:02.070,越发连皇上的心意都不顾及了吗,00:30:57.644,00:31:03.434,"Even if you don't care about it being a palace taboo,
do you not care about His Majesty's feelings?"
00:31:04.480,00:31:05.350,臣妾不敢,,,
00:31:06.600,00:31:08.870,得空就陪着三阿哥温书,00:31:05.440,00:31:07.100,"I dare not, Your Majesty."
00:31:09.560,00:31:11.470,仔细皇上查问起来,00:31:07.779,00:31:11.072,"When you are able, you must help the Third Prince review his studies"
00:31:12.200,00:31:13.470,多谢娘娘关怀,00:31:11.072,00:31:13.072,in case His Majesty inquires.
00:31:15.360,00:31:17.350,近日三阿哥勤快得很,00:31:13.297,00:31:15.717,I thank Your Majesty for caring.
00:31:17.600,00:31:19.190,日日温书到深夜,00:31:16.604,00:31:20.621,"The Third Prince has been diligent,
working into late nights recently."
00:31:20.040,00:31:20.950,这就是了,,,
00:31:21.400,00:31:23.230,三阿哥是皇上的长子,,,
00:31:23.640,00:31:25.190,最应该做个表率,00:31:20.960,00:31:26.700,"Very well, he must set
a good example as His Majesty's eldest son."
00:31:25.840,00:31:27.630,光用功顶什么用啊,,,
00:31:28.680,00:31:31.030,只怕还不如贱坯子呢,00:31:27.164,00:31:32.320,"What's the point of working hard?
It hasn't made him better than a low-born child."
00:31:31.720,00:31:33.230,方才我过来的时候,,,
00:31:33.520,00:31:36.110,看见四阿哥在湖边背书,00:31:32.990,00:31:37.640,"I heard the Fourth Prince reciting
poems by the lake on my way here."
00:31:36.800,00:31:40.030,那书背得可比三阿哥顺溜多了,00:31:37.979,00:31:41.859,He sounded much more fluent than his elder brother.
00:31:41.040,00:31:45.350,皇后您说 这李金桂死得早,,,
00:31:45.680,00:31:47.390,是谁调教得四阿哥,00:31:43.471,00:31:48.600,"Your Majesty, his mother Li Jingui died a long time ago.
I wonder has been taking care of the Forth Prince"
00:31:47.680,00:31:50.350,比这千尊万贵的三阿哥还要伶俐,00:31:48.600,00:31:51.641,so that he is smarter than his distinguished thrid brother?
00:31:50.920,00:31:51.630,你,00:31:51.800,00:31:53.085,You...
00:31:52.560,00:31:54.510,华妃 别失了分寸,00:31:53.640,00:31:56.160,"Consort Fleur, don't forget your manners."
00:31:59.520,00:32:01.670,温宜公主就要满周岁了,,,
00:32:02.120,00:32:04.790,按理说你的位分也该晋一晋了,00:32:00.712,00:32:06.120,"Lady Cao, as Princess Wenyi is turning one year old,
you should be promoted to a higher rank in principle."
00:32:05.400,00:32:06.620,不过皇上说,,,
00:32:06.920,00:32:10.030,眼下正在用兵之际 万事拮据,00:32:06.422,00:32:11.820,"But His Majesty said we are on a budget,
faced with potential outbreaks of warfare."
00:32:10.560,00:32:11.990,必得平定战事后,,,
00:32:12.200,00:32:14.990,给你风风光光地行册封礼才好,00:32:11.820,00:32:16.520,"His Majesty wishes to hold a
glorious ceremony for you after quelling the wars."
00:32:15.720,00:32:17.350,倒也不急在这一时,00:32:16.973,00:32:19.127,I believe you won't mind the delay.
00:32:18.880,00:32:23.390,是 皇上的心意臣妾铭感于心,00:32:19.800,00:32:21.760,"Certainly, Your Majesty."
00:32:23.920,00:32:25.350,只是臣妾卑微,00:32:21.760,00:32:24.740,I am truly grateful for His Majesty's thoughtfulness.
00:32:25.600,00:32:27.190,实在不敢受此隆恩,00:32:25.042,00:32:28.436,But I'm too humble to such heavenly grace from His Majesty.
00:32:27.560,00:32:29.310,臣妾只求能陪伴在,,,
00:32:29.600,00:32:32.550,皇上与皇后身边 便心满意足了,00:32:28.813,00:32:34.300,My only wish is to always serve by Your Majesties' side.
00:32:33.320,00:32:35.150,本宫知道你识大体,,,
00:32:35.400,00:32:37.110,皇上赏你一对白玉如意,,,
00:32:37.440,00:32:38.910,给公主安枕所用,00:32:34.489,00:32:40.529,"I know you always consider the greater good.
His Majesty granted Wenyi a pair of jade ruyi to place her pillow on."
00:32:40.920,00:32:43.950,等一下本宫让人给你带回去,00:32:42.044,00:32:45.900,I will have it sent to your palace later.
00:32:45.080,00:32:45.950,谢皇后,00:32:46.277,00:32:47.680,I thank Your Majesty.
00:33:04.400,00:33:05.380,秋姑姑,,,
00:33:08.120,00:33:09.710,我的爷 您怎么跑这儿来了,00:33:05.679,00:33:07.379,Madam Autumn!
00:33:10.120,00:33:11.310,跟着您的嬷嬷们呢,00:33:09.217,00:33:11.060,My Lord! Why did you come here?
00:33:11.720,00:33:13.270,她们好久不管我了,00:33:11.060,00:33:12.640,Where are your maids?
00:33:13.960,00:33:15.910,我能向皇后娘娘请安吗,00:33:12.640,00:33:15.000,They haven't been looking after me.
00:33:16.520,00:33:17.710,娘娘刚歇下了,00:33:15.140,00:33:17.300,May I pay respect to Her Majesty?
,,,00:33:17.800,00:33:19.496,Her Majesty is having a nap.
00:33:19.480,00:33:21.310,那我能给皇阿玛请安吗,00:33:20.600,00:33:22.640,May I pay respect to Imperial Father?
00:33:22.320,00:33:24.750,皇上传了召您再去吧 好吗,00:33:23.400,00:33:26.220,"You should go when His Majesty summons you, right?"
00:33:26.360,00:33:27.110,来人哪,,,
00:33:29.160,00:33:30.140,好好送四阿哥回去,00:33:27.453,00:33:28.780,Guards.
00:33:30.320,00:33:31.590,嗻 四阿哥请,00:33:30.328,00:33:32.172,Escort the Fourth Prince back to his residence.
,,,00:33:32.172,00:33:33.644,"Yes. Please come, Forth Prince."
00:33:46.040,00:33:49.110,娘娘 这莲子难剥 仔细手疼,00:33:47.200,00:33:50.560,"Your Majesty, peeling lotus seeds
might hurt your fingernails."
00:33:51.160,00:33:53.390,本宫知道皇上喜欢吃莲子,,,
00:33:53.920,00:33:55.110,就自己剥一些,00:33:52.200,00:33:56.520,"I know His Majesty likes lotus seeds,
so I'm peeling them myself."
00:33:55.640,00:33:58.020,等一下好炖了百合莲子汤,,,
00:33:58.400,00:33:59.110,给皇上喝,00:33:56.800,00:34:00.300,I will make lotus seed soup with lily root for His Majesty.
00:33:59.440,00:34:00.390,娘娘对皇上的真心,,,
00:34:00.720,00:34:01.830,真是千金难求,00:34:00.400,00:34:02.960,"Your Majesty's love for His Majesty
is more precious than gold."
00:34:02.240,00:34:04.830,真心又如何 又没有子嗣,00:34:03.415,00:34:06.060,But love is not as important as having a child.
00:34:05.280,00:34:08.550,娘娘 刚才四阿哥来过了,00:34:06.439,00:34:09.840,"Your Majesty, the Fourth Prince stopped by."
00:34:09.360,00:34:10.230,他来干什么,,,
00:34:10.600,00:34:11.790,他想拜见皇上,00:34:10.377,00:34:11.700,Why did he come here?
00:34:12.520,00:34:13.350,罢了吧,00:34:11.700,00:34:13.480,He wished to see His Majesty.
00:34:13.800,00:34:14.710,皇上一看见他,,,
00:34:15.080,00:34:16.630,又想起以前的烦心事,00:34:13.744,00:34:17.860,Forget it. He'll only remind His Majesty of the past troubles.
00:34:17.280,00:34:18.470,又该动气了,,,
00:34:18.840,00:34:21.070,其实四阿哥的生母早亡,00:34:18.239,00:34:19.880,His Majesty would be displeased.
00:34:21.360,00:34:23.230,他孤苦无依 也怪可怜的,00:34:20.000,00:34:24.380,"The Fourth Prince lost his birth mother young.
He is quite pitiful, being here all alone."
00:34:24.240,00:34:27.150,你的意思是让本宫抚养四阿哥,00:34:25.280,00:34:28.420,Are you suggesting that I foster the Fourth Prince?
00:34:27.800,00:34:28.940,奴婢是觉得,,,
00:34:29.240,00:34:30.910,娘娘若觉得膝下寂寞,,,
00:34:31.280,00:34:32.990,四阿哥也是一个人选,00:34:29.053,00:34:34.120,"I was thinking the Fourth Prince might be an option
if Your Majesty wanted ""a filial child serving at your knees."""
00:34:34.720,00:34:36.950,皇上最不喜欢的就是四阿哥,00:34:35.968,00:34:38.550,But he is His Majesty's least favored child.
00:34:37.680,00:34:40.270,本宫抚养他又何用 算了吧,00:34:38.814,00:34:41.740,What's the use of fostering him? Don't bother.
00:34:43.000,00:34:44.060,这天气一热,,,
00:34:44.440,00:34:46.590,这一闷脸上就越发爱长痘了,00:34:44.200,00:34:47.800,The hot and humid weather has caused pimples.
00:34:47.040,00:34:49.630,你看这颗 还有这颗,00:34:48.100,00:34:51.220,"Look, here's one, and here's another."
00:34:50.520,00:34:51.430,得了得了,,,
00:34:51.800,00:34:54.070,如今我瞧脸上长的这几颗,,,
00:34:54.520,00:34:56.150,倒白里透红的好看,00:34:51.890,00:34:57.260,"Don't worry. Now that you have two pimples,
they increase the rosiness of your fair skin."
00:34:56.800,00:34:58.830,前几日姐姐脸上长痘来着,,,
00:34:59.080,00:35:01.150,如今好了 便来说嘴笑话我,00:34:58.060,00:35:02.300,"You were having pimples a few days ago.
Now that they're gone, you start to make fun of mine."
00:35:01.680,00:35:03.950,好了 那不笑话你,00:35:02.953,00:35:05.520,"All right, I'll stop."
00:35:05.000,00:35:07.350,你若喜欢 我便教你一个法子,00:35:05.926,00:35:08.720,I can give you the formula if you like.
00:35:08.320,00:35:10.750,太医院的刘畚原是我同乡,,,
00:35:11.160,00:35:13.910,那日来请脉 给了我一个偏方,00:35:09.640,00:35:15.251,"It was a folk remedy offered by Dr. Liu Ben,
who happens to be from Jizhou as well."
00:35:14.640,00:35:17.710,你瞧 这两日可不都好了,00:35:15.817,00:35:19.060,That is why my pimples were cured so quickly.
00:35:19.040,00:35:22.230,可是刘畚从前从没听说过,00:35:20.200,00:35:23.500,But I've never heard of this doctor.
00:35:22.600,00:35:24.750,他前两日刚从济州过来,,,
00:35:25.080,00:35:26.430,医术倒还不错,00:35:23.839,00:35:27.920,"He was just transferred from Jizhou.
He is a skilled doctor."
00:35:26.920,00:35:28.630,那可不是老乡见老乡了,,,
00:35:29.440,00:35:30.350,为人还好吗,00:35:28.071,00:35:30.251,"It is always nice to know
someone from your hometown."
00:35:30.880,00:35:32.830,我瞧着倒是挺好的,00:35:30.300,00:35:32.000,Is he trustworthy?
00:35:34.920,00:35:35.750,那就好,00:35:32.100,00:35:34.340,"I think so, he's reliable."
00:35:36.040,00:35:37.390,在我们身边伺候的人,00:35:35.700,00:35:37.076,That's good.
00:35:37.760,00:35:38.820,医术倒还是次要的,00:35:37.076,00:35:40.036,"When it comes to selecting doctors,
their character matters more than skills."
00:35:39.160,00:35:42.070,要紧的是为人端正 底细要清楚,00:35:40.300,00:35:43.280,We must ensure that they have a clear background.
00:35:42.520,00:35:43.470,可不是吗,,,
00:35:44.000,00:35:46.300,如今你身边有个温实初,00:35:43.400,00:35:45.240,I agree.
00:35:46.640,00:35:48.110,我这边来了一个刘畚,00:35:45.300,00:35:49.300,"Now that we have Dr. Wen Shichu and Dr. Liu Ben,"
00:35:48.480,00:35:50.270,可也算是相得益彰了,00:35:49.300,00:35:51.500,they will complement each other in medicine.
00:35:50.760,00:35:52.190,姐姐既信得过这人,,,
00:35:52.520,00:35:53.830,那上次江诚给的方子,00:35:51.600,00:35:56.300,"Since you trust this doctor,
did you ask him to review Dr. Jiang's prescription?"
00:35:54.240,00:35:55.070,可叫他看过了,,,
00:35:55.480,00:35:56.190,看过了,,,
00:35:56.520,00:35:59.030,他说是实实在在的好方子,00:35:56.677,00:36:00.184,"Yes, he said it is a perfect formula."
00:36:04.000,00:36:04.710,真的,00:36:05.080,00:36:06.400,Really?
00:36:07.960,00:36:09.310,给娘娘请安,00:36:09.060,00:36:10.680,Peace to Your Highness.
00:36:11.440,00:36:12.070,我还以为,,,
00:36:12.440,00:36:14.070,只有咱们三个人出来逛逛,00:36:12.880,00:36:15.560,I thought that only the three of us were strolling in the garden.
00:36:14.400,00:36:16.960,没想到莞贵人和沈贵人也是啊,00:36:15.560,00:36:18.460,Lady Sourire and Lady Shen are out here as well.
00:36:17.920,00:36:20.380,难得这会子天气凉快些,00:36:19.000,00:36:21.920,It's nice that the weather is cooler now.
00:36:21.320,00:36:22.830,莞妹妹在这儿就好了,,,
00:36:23.200,00:36:24.590,我还正要去找妹妹呢,00:36:22.641,00:36:25.900,"I'm glad to see you here, Sourire.
I was planning to pay you a visit later."
00:36:25.800,00:36:27.430,不知曹姐姐有何见教,00:36:26.840,00:36:29.060,"Cao, I wonder if there is anything I can do for you."
00:36:28.760,00:36:31.110,上次是姐姐失言了,00:36:29.880,00:36:32.820,I made an improper remark the other day.
00:36:31.520,00:36:34.080,听说还引的皇上与妹妹起了龃龉,00:36:32.820,00:36:35.380,I heard that it caused discord between you and His Majesty.
00:36:34.640,00:36:37.020,可姐姐我确实是无心的,00:36:35.870,00:36:38.642,I had no intention of doing that.
00:36:37.520,00:36:38.740,这会儿见了妹妹,,,
00:36:39.120,00:36:41.390,少不得要向妹妹赔罪了,00:36:38.642,00:36:41.972,I must ask for your forgiveness now that I've seen you.
00:36:41.720,00:36:42.700,曹姐姐哪里的话,,,
00:36:43.240,00:36:44.350,妹妹不过是在御前,00:36:42.489,00:36:44.180,"It was nothing like that, Lady Cao."
00:36:44.640,00:36:45.950,和皇上嘀咕了几句,00:36:44.180,00:36:47.200,I simply exchanged banter with His Majesty.
00:36:46.360,00:36:47.830,也不是什么了不起的事,00:36:47.351,00:36:48.960,It was nothing serious.
00:36:48.440,00:36:50.630,妹妹呀 深受皇上的宠爱,,,
00:36:50.960,00:36:53.950,与皇上嘀咕几句不算什么大事,00:36:49.450,00:36:55.460,"His Majesty is very fond of Lady Sourire.
Bantering with His Majesty is all too common for her."
00:36:54.560,00:36:56.110,但是要是换了别人,,,
00:36:56.560,00:36:57.990,那就是天大的事了,00:36:55.600,00:36:59.560,But it would be such a big deal if it was someone else.
00:36:58.600,00:37:00.980,我们如何能与莞贵人相比啊,00:36:59.749,00:37:02.369,How can we possibly compare to Lady Sourire?
00:37:01.600,00:37:04.160,就算是要和皇上嘀咕几句,,,
00:37:04.600,00:37:06.150,那总得见得上面吧,00:37:02.369,00:37:07.540,"We first must be able to see His Majesty
before we can banter with him."
00:37:06.520,00:37:07.270,好了好了,,,
00:37:07.840,00:37:10.030,我们哪有站在这儿说话的道理呀,00:37:07.600,00:37:11.400,"All right, all right.
We shouldn't be all standing here for a talk."
00:37:10.360,00:37:12.070,不如去我那儿坐坐吧,,,
00:37:12.560,00:37:14.630,我还特地命人备了一桌筵席,00:37:11.480,00:37:13.660,How about we all go to my place?
00:37:14.960,00:37:16.070,要向妹妹赔罪呢,00:37:13.886,00:37:17.360,I've had food prepared to apologize to Sourire.
00:37:16.440,00:37:17.550,这不还特地请了,,,
00:37:17.920,00:37:19.590,欣常在和齐妃作陪,00:37:17.589,00:37:20.860,"And I invited Consort Astuce
and Attendant Joie for this purpose."
00:37:20.080,00:37:22.510,莞妹妹你可一定要赏光啊,00:37:21.049,00:37:24.220,"I hope you will not decline, Sourire."
00:37:23.520,00:37:24.350,沈贵人,00:37:24.639,00:37:26.240,"Lady Shen,"
00:37:25.280,00:37:28.270,听说沈贵人弹得一手的好琴,00:37:26.320,00:37:29.720,I've heard of your talent for playing the zither.
00:37:29.160,00:37:32.190,这俗话说主雅客来勤,00:37:29.800,00:37:33.520,"It's said that ""An entertaining host attracts visitors."""
00:37:32.520,00:37:34.270,可是我这个做东的呢,,,
00:37:34.640,00:37:36.150,又实在没什么本事,00:37:33.709,00:37:37.216,"But I am such an inept hostess;
I have no such talent."
00:37:36.560,00:37:38.790,所以还得请沈贵人,,,
00:37:39.080,00:37:41.510,为我们弹奏一曲来留客呀,00:37:37.891,00:37:43.124,"So I hope Lady Shen won't mind
helping me entertain my guests with your music."
00:37:44.400,00:37:46.550,如此多谢曹姐姐美意,00:37:45.584,00:37:48.364,"I'm grateful for your invitation, Lady Cao."
00:37:48.880,00:37:50.470,小主 梅子汤凉好了,,,
00:37:50.840,00:37:51.820,请各位小主品尝,00:37:50.100,00:37:53.200,"My Lady, the prune drink has cooled down.
We've brought some for everyone."
00:37:54.960,00:37:56.870,方才动了荤腥,,,
00:37:57.480,00:37:59.430,现在又给咱们解腻,00:37:56.200,00:38:00.960,"You brought on the refreshing drink
after the greasy dishes."
00:38:00.520,00:38:03.190,你的心思真是难得,00:38:01.500,00:38:04.560,What a thoughtful hostess we have!
00:38:13.480,00:38:15.030,沈贵人这是怎么了,00:38:14.528,00:38:16.680,"What is wrong, Lady Shen?"
00:38:17.000,00:38:19.910,许是刚才多吃了些白玉蹄花,,,
00:38:20.200,00:38:20.990,有些恶心,00:38:18.120,00:38:22.161,"I probably had more pork rind jelly than I should have.
I'm feeling a little nauseous now."
00:38:21.200,00:38:21.870,恶心,,,
00:38:24.280,00:38:25.590,这刚才还好端端的,00:38:22.161,00:38:23.481,Nauseous?
00:38:25.880,00:38:26.710,怎么会恶心呢,00:38:25.339,00:38:27.726,But you were fine just a moment ago.
00:38:27.760,00:38:29.310,你这样恶心有几日了,,,
00:38:30.200,00:38:32.150,近来天气炎热,00:38:29.000,00:38:30.960,Have you been feeling nauseous recently?
00:38:32.480,00:38:35.040,我不思饮食也有六七日了,00:38:31.200,00:38:36.260,I haven't been eating well the past week due to the summer heat.
,,,00:38:36.300,00:38:37.420,Ah?
00:38:37.200,00:38:40.550,莫不是有喜了,00:38:38.212,00:38:42.239,Is that ... because of pregnancy?
00:38:45.920,00:38:46.590,我问你,,,
00:38:47.360,00:38:49.030,你这个月的月信来了没有,00:38:47.120,00:38:50.600," Have you received your ""monthly letters""?"
00:38:51.240,00:38:51.990,我,00:38:52.180,00:38:53.200,I ...
00:38:52.800,00:38:55.100,大家都是姐妹 有什么可害燥的,00:38:53.200,00:38:56.200,"Aiya, we are sisters. Don't be shy."
00:38:55.440,00:38:56.150,快说呀 是啊,00:38:56.200,00:38:57.880,"- You can tell us.

00:39:01.640,00:39:02.910,这八成是有了,,,
00:39:03.320,00:39:05.030,齐妃娘娘 你说是不是,00:39:02.560,00:39:04.200,She's very likely to be with child.
00:39:07.360,00:39:08.630,你除了恶心之外,00:39:04.300,00:39:06.380,"What does Your Highness think, Consort Astuce?"
00:39:08.960,00:39:10.950,还有没有觉得身子懒怠,00:39:08.512,00:39:13.640,"In addition to feeling nauseous,
have you been feeling lethargic lately?"
00:39:11.320,00:39:12.350,几日不想动弹,,,
00:39:13.200,00:39:15.230,还有时候想吃辛辣的食物,00:39:13.904,00:39:16.844,And ... and having a craving for spicy food?
00:39:17.160,00:39:21.310,小卫子 快去太医院传太医来,00:39:18.180,00:39:22.900,"Xiao-Weizi, send for the doctors immediately."

00:39:41.600,00:39:43.670,还不知详情 未免疏漏,00:39:41.120,00:39:43.820,I was just informed. I don't know the details.
00:39:44.080,00:39:44.710,臣妾已经命人,,,
00:39:45.120,00:39:46.590,去敬事房拿存档来了,00:39:44.122,00:39:47.740,"To be thorough, I have ordered the Attendance Service
to send their records here immediately."

00:40:06.280,00:40:08.630,太医 可确定是真的有孕吗,00:40:07.340,00:40:10.060,"Doctor, can you confirm whether Lady Shen is pregnant?"

00:40:54.720,00:40:57.280,如今她有喜 更要事事小心照料,00:40:52.900,00:40:58.560,"As Lady Shen's personal maids, you must
take more care in everything now that she's pregnant."
00:40:57.520,00:41:00.030,每日饮食起居都要来向本宫回禀,00:40:58.640,00:41:01.460,Report to me daily on her diet and health.

00:41:07.360,00:41:09.710,是不是该找一个稳妥的太医,00:41:05.000,00:41:08.500,"Your Majesty, now that Lady Shen is with child,"
00:41:10.160,00:41:11.300,帮她照顾着,00:41:08.500,00:41:12.420,should we select an experienced doctor to attend to her?
00:41:11.520,00:41:13.900,皇上 刚才来给臣妾诊脉的,,,
00:41:14.200,00:41:15.260,是太医院的刘畚,00:41:12.800,00:41:16.580,"Your Majesty, Dr. Liu Ben came here to take my pulses."
00:41:15.640,00:41:17.390,臣妾觉得他很不错,,,
00:41:17.840,00:41:19.430,他又是臣妾的同乡,00:41:16.600,00:41:21.040,"He is a reliable doctor,
and from my hometown Jizhou as well."
00:41:19.840,00:41:21.750,要不就让他来照应吧,00:41:21.140,00:41:23.360,Why don't we let him look after me?
00:41:22.840,00:41:23.670,那也好,,,
00:41:23.920,00:41:25.990,现在最重要的就是你的身体,00:41:23.700,00:41:25.260,Just as well.

00:41:28.240,00:41:29.750,千万不可以有什么差池啊,00:41:27.680,00:41:31.260,"You must ensure the best care of yourself.
Don't let anything go amiss."

00:41:33.520,00:41:34.710,皇上皇后来了半日,00:41:33.073,00:41:34.620,My apologies to Your Majesties.
00:41:35.040,00:41:36.430,却连茶也没有奉上一杯,00:41:34.620,00:41:37.800,I forgot to serve Your Majesties tea all this time.
00:41:36.680,00:41:38.310,臣妾真是高兴糊涂了,00:41:37.860,00:41:39.811,I was overwhelmed with joy.

00:41:43.240,00:41:44.300,你想用点什么,,,
00:41:44.920,00:41:47.550,适才臣妾打翻了一些梅子汤,00:41:44.273,00:41:46.280,Would you like something to drink?
00:41:47.960,00:41:49.630,现下倒有些想了,00:41:46.340,00:41:50.474,"I spilled some prune soup earlier.
I'm craving for it now..."
00:41:49.840,00:41:50.470,快快,,,
00:41:50.800,00:41:52.350,有有有 梅子汤有的是,00:41:50.474,00:41:51.920,"Quick, quick."

00:41:53.880,00:41:55.790,我天天叫人做了送你那儿去,00:41:53.780,00:41:57.000,I will have the drink sent to you every day if you like!

00:42:06.720,00:42:07.830,别人倒也罢了,,,
00:42:08.200,00:42:09.790,莞贵人不喜欢酸的,,,
00:42:10.080,00:42:11.030,给她多放点糖,00:42:07.700,00:42:12.520,"Lady Sourire doesn't enjoy sour food.
Add more sugar to hers."
00:42:11.200,00:42:11.910,是,00:42:12.520,00:42:13.614,Yes.

00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"I dimly recall the colorful blooms in every summer.
They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
