00:07:32.820,00:07:34.360,你明知眉庄有身孕,00:07:32.810,00:07:34.551,"You knew Meizhuang was pregnant,"
00:07:35.080,00:07:36.490,不能受任何惊吓,00:07:35.070,00:07:36.647,and should not be disturbed.
00:07:38.450,00:07:40.660,你的下人还跑到碎玉轩传话,00:07:38.440,00:07:40.784,Yet your messenger came here to the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:07:42.540,00:07:43.330,陵容,00:07:42.530,00:07:43.500,"Lingrong,"
00:07:45.960,00:07:47.170,你安的什么心,00:07:45.734,00:07:47.546,Was your purpose a spiteful one?
00:07:50.380,00:07:51.670,姐姐我不知道这事,00:07:50.370,00:07:52.028,"Lumière, I wasn't aware."
00:07:52.550,00:07:53.540,姐姐可别怪我,00:07:52.540,00:07:53.530,Please don't blame me.
00:07:54.220,00:07:55.300,我真不知道这事,00:07:54.210,00:07:55.500,I didn't know my servant did this.
00:07:56.680,00:07:57.920,姐姐可要相信我,00:07:56.670,00:07:57.910,"Please do believe me, Lumière."
00:07:58.310,00:07:59.510,宝鹊也定是无意的,00:07:58.300,00:07:59.701,Sparrow mustn't have meant any harm.
00:08:00.060,00:08:01.300,如果我知道会这样的话,00:08:00.050,00:08:01.658,"Had I known it would come to this,"
00:08:01.890,00:08:03.600,宁愿是自己替眉姐姐受苦,00:08:01.880,00:08:03.590,I'd rather suffer in Meizhuang's stead.
00:08:04.270,00:08:04.880,姐姐,00:08:04.260,00:08:05.171,"Lumière,"
00:08:05.520,00:08:06.980,我们一同入宫我,00:08:05.171,00:08:06.970,"we entered the palace together, I..."
00:08:11.950,00:08:13.480,有意也好无意也罢,00:08:11.940,00:08:13.470,Whether deliberate or unintentional -
00:08:14.530,00:08:15.940,他们母子平安也就罢了,00:08:14.520,00:08:16.231,I won't mind if the mother and the child are safe.
00:08:17.120,00:08:18.530,若有半点差池,00:08:17.110,00:08:18.787,"If half a hair goes amiss,"
00:08:19.700,00:08:21.440,我绝不与你善罢甘休,00:08:19.690,00:08:21.430,this will never end for you.
00:08:24.670,00:08:25.370,姐姐打得对,00:08:24.660,00:08:26.029,"You're right to slap me, Lumière."
00:08:26.330,00:08:27.820,是陵容管教下人不善,00:08:26.320,00:08:28.134,"It's my fault to have failed to discipline my servant,"
00:08:29.050,00:08:30.410,才闯出这弥天大祸,00:08:29.040,00:08:30.802,causing this disaster as vast as Heaven.
00:08:31.630,00:08:33.250,宝鹊进来,00:08:31.620,00:08:33.240,"Sparrow, come in here!"
00:08:37.890,00:08:38.720,给娘娘请安,00:08:37.880,00:08:39.034,Peace to Your Highness.
00:08:43.390,00:08:44.600,你还有脸请安,00:08:43.380,00:08:44.840,"You dare to say ""peace""?!"
00:08:44.850,00:08:46.090,娘娘奴婢知错了,00:08:44.840,00:08:46.080,"Your Highness, I admit my fault!"
00:08:46.650,00:08:48.180,你惊着惠嫔娘娘的平安,00:08:46.640,00:08:48.638,You disturbed the peace of Concubine Vertu!
00:08:49.110,00:08:51.270,存心叫本宫心里过不去是不是,00:08:49.100,00:08:51.427,Are you intentionally making me feel guilt-ridden?
00:08:52.190,00:08:54.100,小主当心自己的身子,00:08:52.180,00:08:54.090,"My Lady, please care for your body."
00:08:54.400,00:08:55.110,娘娘饶命,00:08:54.390,00:08:55.534,"Your Highness, please spare me!"
00:08:56.200,00:08:57.860,本宫跟眉姐姐多年的情分,00:08:56.190,00:08:58.117,My years of sisterhood with Meizhuang -
00:08:58.620,00:09:00.820,偏你这蹄子惊着眉姐姐的胎气,00:08:58.610,00:09:00.810,all ruined by your hooves startling her!
00:09:02.410,00:09:03.650,若姐姐有什么闪失,00:09:02.400,00:09:03.841,"If anything goes wrong with Meizhuang,"
00:09:04.410,00:09:05.870,我便随姐姐一同去了,00:09:04.400,00:09:06.268,I'll take my own life with her!
00:09:06.620,00:09:07.910,还要这身子做什么,00:09:06.610,00:09:08.134,Why would I still care for my body?
00:09:09.880,00:09:10.790,让你多嘴,00:09:09.870,00:09:10.914,You and your big mouth!
00:09:11.300,00:09:12.790,奴婢不敢了你这死奴才,00:09:11.290,00:09:13.749,"- Damn you, you big-mouthed slave!
- Your Highness, I won't dare do it again!"
00:09:13.090,00:09:13.790,娘娘奴婢知错了,,,
00:09:14.010,00:09:16.170,奴才不懂事 安嫔不要坏了规矩,00:09:14.000,00:09:16.494,"The servant didn't behave properly;
But Concubine An should not break rules."
00:09:18.390,00:09:20.170,皇上万福金安 皇上金安,00:09:18.380,00:09:20.528,"- Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
- Peace to Your Majesty."
00:09:22.680,00:09:23.920,奴才乱了规矩,00:09:22.670,00:09:24.244,The servant broke the rules.
00:09:25.940,00:09:28.270,拖去安静的地方乱棍打死就是,00:09:25.930,00:09:28.427,Drag her to some secluded place and flog her to death.
00:09:28.650,00:09:29.100,苏培盛,00:09:28.640,00:09:29.300,Su Peisheng.
00:09:29.310,00:09:29.800,嗻,00:09:29.300,00:09:29.800,Yes.
00:09:30.650,00:09:31.260,来人,00:09:30.640,00:09:31.384,Guards.
00:09:31.820,00:09:32.600,皇上饶命,00:09:31.810,00:09:33.100,"Your Majesty, please spare my life!"
00:09:33.110,00:09:33.940,奴婢知错了,00:09:33.100,00:09:34.131,I admit my fault!
00:09:34.280,00:09:35.440,奴婢再也不敢了,00:09:34.270,00:09:35.434,I'll never do it again!
00:09:35.820,00:09:37.530,皇上饶命 奴婢再也不敢了,00:09:35.505,00:09:37.680,"Your Majesty, please spare my life!
I'll never do it again!"
00:09:37.660,00:09:38.190,拖出去,00:09:37.680,00:09:38.610,Take her.
00:09:38.620,00:09:39.860,奴婢再也不敢了,00:09:38.610,00:09:40.184,I'll never do it again!
00:09:40.580,00:09:41.610,皇上饶命,00:09:40.570,00:09:41.834,"Your Majesty, please spare my life!"
00:09:42.120,00:09:43.730,奴婢再也不敢了,00:09:42.110,00:09:43.720,I'll never do it again!
00:09:44.580,00:09:46.410,皇上饶命,00:09:44.570,00:09:46.400,"Your Majesty, please spare my life!"
00:09:47.170,00:09:48.780,用力呀 娘娘 快点,00:09:47.160,00:09:48.770,"Push, Your Highness!"
00:09:48.920,00:09:50.410,用力呀 小主 用力呀 小主,00:09:48.910,00:09:50.400,"Push, My Lady!"
00:09:50.750,00:09:51.540,用力呀 小主,00:09:50.740,00:09:51.731,"Push, My Lady!"
00:09:52.550,00:09:53.280,小主 小主,00:09:52.540,00:09:53.540,"My Lady, My Lady!"
00:09:53.550,00:09:54.460,用力呀 小主,00:09:53.540,00:09:54.617,"Push, My Lady!"
00:09:56.670,00:09:57.880,快了快了 小主你坚持住,00:09:56.660,00:09:58.120,"Almost there! My Lady, hold on!"
00:09:58.130,00:09:58.960,回禀皇上,00:09:58.120,00:09:59.084,"Your Majesty,"
00:09:59.760,00:10:01.720,温太医的血已经止住了,00:09:59.750,00:10:01.710,Dr. Wen's bleeding has stopped.
00:10:02.010,00:10:02.880,性命无大碍,00:10:02.000,00:10:02.870,He will survive.
00:10:03.600,00:10:04.300,只是,00:10:03.590,00:10:04.357,It's just...
00:10:05.060,00:10:05.760,你说,00:10:05.050,00:10:05.750,Speak.
00:10:06.100,00:10:08.260,只是和宫中的公公们一样,00:10:06.090,00:10:08.250,He is now like the eunuchs in the palace.
00:10:09.020,00:10:11.430,子嗣上再无可望了,00:10:09.010,00:10:11.420,He'll never be able to have children.
00:10:13.020,00:10:13.730,知道了,00:10:13.010,00:10:13.787,I see.
00:10:15.990,00:10:17.650,怎么惠嫔还没有动静,00:10:15.980,00:10:17.734,Why is Concubine Vertu still in labor?
00:10:18.070,00:10:18.940,皇上别着急,00:10:18.060,00:10:19.131,"Your Majesty, don't worry."
00:10:21.700,00:10:22.480,回禀皇上,00:10:21.690,00:10:22.470,"Your Majesty,"
00:10:22.950,00:10:24.280,惠嫔娘娘受了惊吓,00:10:22.940,00:10:25.820,"Concubine Vertu was startled,
and her prenatal qi is greatly destabilized."
00:10:24.700,00:10:25.440,胎气大动,,,
00:10:25.830,00:10:26.860,情况实在不好,00:10:25.820,00:10:27.218,The situation is dire.
00:10:27.790,00:10:29.070,微臣医术浅陋,00:10:27.780,00:10:29.461,"My skill is shallow in this area,"
00:10:29.750,00:10:32.330,且娘娘的胎一直由温太医照料,00:10:29.740,00:10:32.655,"and Her Highness's pregnancy
has always been under Dr. Wen's care."
00:10:33.000,00:10:35.290,素日什么情况 微臣实在不知,00:10:32.990,00:10:35.280,I have no information on her past medical conditions.
00:10:35.920,00:10:38.160,现在微臣真是束手无策,00:10:35.910,00:10:38.150,"It's as if my hands are locked, Your Majesty."
00:10:38.590,00:10:39.920,孩子呢 孩子如何,00:10:38.580,00:10:40.167,What about the child? How is it?
00:10:40.680,00:10:42.260,娘娘有血崩之势,00:10:40.670,00:10:42.534,Her Highness has the potential to bleed to death.
00:10:42.850,00:10:45.050,因为失血过多使不上力,00:10:42.840,00:10:45.420,She has already lost so much blood that she has no strength to push.
00:10:45.430,00:10:46.920,孩子的头一直出不来,00:10:45.420,00:10:47.044,The child's head is stuck.
00:10:47.850,00:10:50.010,微臣以固冲汤给娘娘服下,00:10:47.840,00:10:50.000,"I gave Her Highness Guchong soup to consume,"
00:10:50.560,00:10:51.430,也不见好转,00:10:50.349,00:10:51.721,but the situation did not improve.
00:10:52.440,00:10:53.850,因为微臣实在不知道,00:10:52.754,00:10:55.300,"I don't know about Her Highness's constitution,"
00:10:54.190,00:10:55.310,娘娘是何体质,,,
00:10:55.650,00:10:57.360,所以不敢滥用止血汤药,00:10:55.640,00:10:57.584,so I don't dare use herbs to stop bleeding
00:10:58.400,00:11:00.110,若是温太医在,00:10:58.390,00:11:00.134,If Dr. Wen were here...
00:11:01.200,00:11:02.440,温太医已经醒了,00:11:01.190,00:11:02.631,Dr. Wen has regained consciousness.
00:11:03.030,00:11:05.400,不过他现在的身体状况,00:11:03.020,00:11:05.390,"But given his health condition,"
00:11:05.870,00:11:08.580,恐怕还不能为娘娘接生,00:11:05.860,00:11:08.570,I'm afraid he cannot help deliver the baby.
00:11:10.000,00:11:11.450,温太医不能下地也无妨,00:11:09.990,00:11:11.674,"Even though he cannot walk,"
00:11:12.000,00:11:13.160,可以用担架台进来,00:11:11.990,00:11:13.719,we can bring him in with a stretcher.
00:11:14.170,00:11:16.410,温太医虽然不能助娘娘顺产,00:11:14.160,00:11:16.567,"Dr. Wen may not be able to aid in Her Highness's labor,"
00:11:16.750,00:11:19.000,但是他素知娘娘的体质如何,00:11:16.740,00:11:18.990,but he understands Her Highness's constitution.
00:11:19.340,00:11:21.250,可以同微臣一同斟酌用药,00:11:19.330,00:11:21.374,We could discuss the medication together.
00:11:26.850,00:11:28.590,温大人无辜受罪已是罪过,00:11:26.840,00:11:28.714,It's already a sin that Dr. Wen became implicated;
00:11:29.430,00:11:31.100,若再连累了眉姐姐和胎儿,00:11:29.420,00:11:31.340,"if this harms the safety of Meizhuang and her baby,"
00:11:31.350,00:11:32.310,那如何了得呀,00:11:31.340,00:11:32.935,the outcome would be unimaginable.
00:11:34.230,00:11:35.720,快把温实初抬到这儿来,00:11:34.220,00:11:35.710,Carry Wen Shichu in here.
00:11:36.190,00:11:36.930,嗻,00:11:36.180,00:11:36.920,Yes.

,,,00:11:52.158,00:11:52.992,Wei Lin.
00:11:53.370,00:11:54.960,惠嫔一向体质温厚,00:11:53.360,00:11:54.950,Concubine Vertu has always had a warm constitution.
00:11:55.750,00:11:56.490,她是,00:11:55.740,00:11:57.410,But now ...
00:11:57.420,00:12:00.130,她是因为气血逆转导致难产,00:11:57.410,00:12:00.120,"qi and blood have become reversed,
causing obstructed labor."
00:12:00.720,00:12:01.370,快,00:12:00.710,00:12:01.561,Quickly!
00:12:02.050,00:12:03.920,快给她用山参吊住精神,00:12:02.040,00:12:04.278,Use mountain ginseng to preserve her consciousness.
00:12:04.800,00:12:07.640,再服升举大补汤 快,00:12:04.790,00:12:07.630,And then use the Shengju Tonifying Soup. Hurry!
00:12:07.890,00:12:09.170,徒弟知道 快去准备,00:12:07.880,00:12:09.601,Understood. Go prepare these right now!
00:12:10.980,00:12:11.680,把药拿来,00:12:10.970,00:12:12.071,Bring me the herbs.
00:12:13.770,00:12:14.480,师傅,00:12:13.760,00:12:14.637,Shifu.
00:12:15.690,00:12:16.600,这是催产药,00:12:15.680,00:12:16.857,This is the labor tonic.
00:12:17.020,00:12:18.180,你刚才说要加点什么,00:12:17.010,00:12:18.739,What did you say we should add?
00:12:22.400,00:12:24.640,加盐梅七个 盐梅,00:12:22.390,00:12:24.630,"- Salty plums, seven salty plums.
- Salty plums."

00:14:51.220,00:14:52.210,嬛儿,00:14:51.210,00:14:52.200,Huan'er.
00:14:53.600,00:14:54.380,姐姐,00:14:53.590,00:14:54.370,Meizhuang.
00:14:54.640,00:14:55.470,不哭了,00:14:54.630,00:14:55.594,Don't cry.
00:14:56.640,00:14:59.720,我想和你说会儿话,00:14:56.630,00:14:59.710,I just want to talk to you.

00:15:05.650,00:15:06.390,出去吧,00:15:05.640,00:15:06.614,You all may leave.
00:15:07.110,00:15:10.020,温实初留下,00:15:07.100,00:15:08.314,Wen Shichu...
,,,00:15:08.949,00:15:10.211,will stay.
00:15:16.450,00:15:17.740,我的孩子,00:15:16.440,00:15:17.730,My child.
00:15:21.500,00:15:23.410,她还这样小,00:15:21.490,00:15:23.400,How small she is.
00:15:24.920,00:15:26.250,这样软,00:15:24.910,00:15:26.240,So soft.
00:15:28.800,00:15:29.630,是啊,00:15:28.790,00:15:29.620,Yes.
00:15:30.470,00:15:31.750,不过很快就长大了,00:15:30.460,00:15:31.834,But she'll grow up so fast.
00:15:33.050,00:15:35.170,你看弘瞻和灵犀长得多快啊,00:15:33.040,00:15:35.160,Just look how quickly Hongyan and Lingxi have grown.
,,,00:15:37.000,00:15:38.281,"Meizhuang,"
00:15:37.010,00:15:40.430,姐姐皇上希望你平安,00:15:38.916,00:15:40.687,His Majesty wants you to be safe.
00:15:41.600,00:15:43.260,已经封你为惠妃了,00:15:41.590,00:15:43.651,He already promoted you to Consort Vertu.
00:15:45.020,00:15:48.810,你这熹贵妃当得快活吗,00:15:45.010,00:15:48.800,Are you enjoying being Noble Consort Lumiere?
00:15:53.610,00:15:56.570,你这万千宠爱的贵妃,00:15:54.101,00:15:57.061,"If being a Noble Consort, at the center of his favor,"
00:15:57.580,00:15:59.740,都当得没有滋味,00:15:57.570,00:15:59.730,"is still flavorless and empty,"
00:16:01.210,00:16:06.250,我又何必稀罕什么惠妃呢,00:16:01.200,00:16:06.240,"why would I ...
care about being Consort Vertu?"
00:16:08.460,00:16:11.330,我知道姐姐不在意妃位,00:16:08.450,00:16:11.320,"I know you don't care about the rank, Meizhuang."
00:16:12.760,00:16:14.340,可是子凭母贵,00:16:12.750,00:16:15.099,"But ""the child becomes distinguished
 by the esteem granted to the mother."""
00:16:15.430,00:16:17.420,也得为孩子的将来打算,00:16:15.420,00:16:17.410,You need to think about her future.
00:16:19.180,00:16:23.270,我的孩子她不会在意这些,00:16:19.170,00:16:23.260,My child .. she won't care about these things.
,,,00:16:28.970,00:16:30.427,Shichu ...
00:16:28.980,00:16:33.900,实初你抱过孩子没有,00:16:32.031,00:16:34.030,Have you held the baby?
00:16:35.110,00:16:37.200,你抱一抱,00:16:34.966,00:16:37.190,You ... should hold her.
00:16:40.830,00:16:41.820,微臣,00:16:40.820,00:16:42.011,Your Highness ...
00:16:43.500,00:16:44.410,微臣不敢,00:16:43.490,00:16:44.634,I don't dare.
00:16:49.670,00:16:53.540,你还在怪我是不是,00:16:49.660,00:16:53.530,You're still blaming me ... aren't you?
00:16:57.800,00:17:00.920,那晚的事也有我的错,00:16:57.790,00:17:00.910,For that night...I was also to blame.
00:17:01.640,00:17:02.630,你不必自责,00:17:01.630,00:17:03.167,Don't bear the burden of blame.
00:17:04.310,00:17:06.680,你今日挥刀自残,00:17:04.300,00:17:06.670,Today you mutilated yourself with a knife;
00:17:07.610,00:17:12.070,难道不是因为自责太深的缘故吗,00:17:07.600,00:17:12.060,isn't it because of your deep regret?
00:17:14.950,00:17:16.030,我知道,00:17:14.940,00:17:16.187,"I know,"
00:17:18.320,00:17:20.440,我知道你恨我,00:17:18.310,00:17:20.430,I know you resent me
00:17:22.450,00:17:23.610,恨我那一日,00:17:22.440,00:17:23.600,for that night.
00:17:24.250,00:17:27.330,把太后赐予我和皇上的酒,00:17:24.240,00:17:27.320,"The Empress Dowager bestowed the wine upon His Majesty and me,"
00:17:27.790,00:17:29.160,哄你喝下,00:17:27.780,00:17:30.000,and I coaxed you to drink it with me.
00:17:30.800,00:17:33.410,造成你终身之憾,00:17:30.790,00:17:33.400,Causing you to have this lifelong loss.
,,,00:17:36.830,00:17:38.146,Meizhuang ...
00:17:36.840,00:17:40.080,姐姐你糊涂了呀,00:17:38.714,00:17:40.371,you were so foolish.
00:17:43.140,00:17:45.680,我是要死的人,00:17:43.130,00:17:45.670,I am ... close to dying.
00:17:47.730,00:17:49.840,还怕什么呢,00:17:48.489,00:17:50.599,What's there to be afraid of?
00:17:52.780,00:17:57.020,这样糊涂一次我很欢喜,00:17:52.770,00:17:57.010,I'm so happy that ... I was able to indulge myself once.
00:17:58.280,00:18:01.070,终生无憾了,00:17:58.270,00:18:01.060,I have no regret in this life.
00:18:03.700,00:18:04.610,嬛儿,00:18:03.690,00:18:04.867,Huan'er.
00:18:06.080,00:18:09.410,这些年只有实初和你,00:18:06.070,00:18:09.400,"All these years, only Shichu and you have been"
00:18:10.250,00:18:12.410,对我是真心的好,00:18:10.240,00:18:12.400,genuinely good to me.
00:18:14.510,00:18:19.170,可是实初他心里有你,00:18:14.500,00:18:19.160,But Shichu ... he holds you in his heart.
00:18:21.350,00:18:24.210,所以他对我好,00:18:21.340,00:18:24.200,So his kindness towards me has always been...
00:18:25.930,00:18:27.420,也是因为你,00:18:25.920,00:18:27.410,because of you.
00:18:29.520,00:18:30.430,姐姐,00:18:29.510,00:18:30.420,Meizhuang...
00:18:35.400,00:18:36.440,实初,00:18:35.390,00:18:36.430,"Shichu,"
00:18:39.950,00:18:44.240,我想问你一句,00:18:39.940,00:18:44.230,I wish to ... ask you this ...
00:18:45.490,00:18:46.610,这些年,00:18:45.480,00:18:46.801,"All these years,"
,,,00:18:48.700,00:18:50.541,have you ever
00:18:48.710,00:18:54.580,你对我有没有过一点真心,00:18:51.142,00:18:53.038,felt a shred of
,,,00:18:53.239,00:18:55.139,true affection towards me?
00:18:57.300,00:19:00.760,有没有过一点点,00:18:57.290,00:19:00.750,Even just ... in the slightest?
00:19:18.940,00:19:19.730,罢了,00:19:18.930,00:19:20.000,Forget it.
00:19:21.910,00:19:24.990,我情愿你不说,00:19:21.900,00:19:24.980,I'd rather you not answer
00:19:26.790,00:19:27.740,也不要,00:19:26.780,00:19:28.467,than
00:19:28.450,00:19:31.410,你因为可怜我快死了,00:19:28.698,00:19:31.528,tell me a lie out of pity
00:19:33.420,00:19:35.080,而骗我,00:19:33.399,00:19:35.252,for my death.
00:19:44.100,00:19:48.090,那日的酒并不足以让我动情,00:19:44.090,00:19:48.356,"That night ... the wine alone ...
would not have been enough to stir my emotions."
00:19:49.560,00:19:50.390,所以,00:19:49.550,00:19:50.480,So ...

00:20:53.000,00:20:53.990,嬛儿,00:20:52.990,00:20:54.214,Huan'er.
00:20:55.290,00:20:58.160,孩子还没有起名字吧,00:20:55.280,00:20:58.150,"The baby hasn't been given a name, right?"
00:21:05.550,00:21:06.510,青争不口,00:21:05.540,00:21:07.169,"Jinghe.

00:26:13.360,00:26:14.270,去伺候姐姐吧,,,
00:26:32.380,00:26:33.120,什么事,00:26:32.370,00:26:33.512,What's the matter?
00:26:33.750,00:26:35.490,你怎么连衣裳都来不及换,00:26:33.740,00:26:35.781,Did you not have time to change your clothes?
00:26:36.550,00:26:38.910,这袖口破了也没发觉吗,00:26:36.540,00:26:39.394,Are you not aware your sleeve is ripped?
00:26:40.970,00:26:41.750,还是你心细,00:26:40.960,00:26:42.174,You are very observant.
00:26:42.850,00:26:45.010,来我给你补两针,00:26:42.840,00:26:45.000,"Here, I'll stitch it up for you,"
00:26:45.520,00:26:46.630,只当我报答你,00:26:45.510,00:26:46.920,to repay you for
00:26:46.930,00:26:48.640,昨天对我姐姐的维护之情,00:26:46.920,00:26:48.630,defending my sister yesterday.
00:26:53.320,00:26:53.850,这,00:26:53.310,00:26:54.100,But...
00:26:54.110,00:26:54.890,千万别说话,00:26:54.100,00:26:55.367,Don't talk.
00:27:17.760,00:27:18.250,好了,00:27:17.750,00:27:18.710,All done.
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.550,缝衣裳的时候千万不能说话,00:27:18.710,00:27:20.634,"You can't talk when your clothes are being sewn,"
00:27:20.930,00:27:23.790,否则会娶个凶悍的老婆天天骂你,00:27:20.920,00:27:23.981,"or else you will marry a savage wife
 who curses you every day."
00:27:24.850,00:27:25.800,那你还不是说话了,00:27:24.840,00:27:26.024,But you just talked.
00:27:26.390,00:27:27.050,我缝完了,00:27:26.380,00:27:27.474,I'm done sewing.
00:27:27.890,00:27:28.970,缝得虽然不好,00:27:27.880,00:27:29.161,"It's not perfect,"
00:27:29.390,00:27:31.510,但是比你刚才那样还是好很多呢,00:27:29.380,00:27:31.734,but it's definitely better than what you had before.
,,,00:27:34.050,00:27:35.224,Great!
00:27:34.060,00:27:37.980,很好像只活灵活现的蜈蚣,00:27:35.491,00:27:38.237,It looks like a lively centipede.
00:27:40.150,00:27:42.110,从来没有别的女子给我缝过衣裳,00:27:40.140,00:27:42.334,"No other lady ever sews clothes for me,"
00:27:42.660,00:27:43.440,只有我额娘,00:27:42.650,00:27:43.731,only my mother.
00:27:44.450,00:27:45.560,我额娘是熙太嫔,00:27:44.440,00:27:45.820,My mother is Concubine Dowager Harmonie.
00:27:45.830,00:27:46.860,她原是针功局的,00:27:45.820,00:27:47.584,She used to work at the Embroidery Department.
00:27:49.120,00:27:50.610,你额娘待你真好,00:27:49.110,00:27:50.901,Your mother treats you well.
00:27:51.250,00:27:52.410,她一定很疼你,00:27:51.240,00:27:52.934,She must care a lot about you.
00:27:55.040,00:27:55.950,公主喝药,00:27:55.030,00:27:56.475,"Please take the medicine, Princess."
00:27:57.210,00:27:58.000,来,00:27:57.200,00:27:58.257,Here...
00:28:00.630,00:28:03.670,来来,00:28:00.620,00:28:03.326,Come here ... Here...
00:28:04.050,00:28:04.880,公主不喝药,00:28:04.040,00:28:05.305,How can the Princess recover
00:28:05.470,00:28:06.630,这病怎么会好起来,00:28:05.460,00:28:06.620,if she doesn't take the medication?
00:28:07.350,00:28:08.550,你看连哭声都这么低,00:28:07.340,00:28:09.008,"Look at her, even her cry is weak."
00:28:09.560,00:28:12.140,公主太小这药是喂不进去的,00:28:09.550,00:28:12.130,"The Princess is too young.
It's hard to feed her medicine."
00:28:12.690,00:28:14.680,就算是喂进去了也会吐出来的,00:28:12.680,00:28:15.034,She will spit it out even if we feed it to her.
00:28:16.770,00:28:18.680,那就让乳母喝化作乳汁,00:28:16.426,00:28:19.220,Then let the wet nurses take it and convert the medicine to breast milk.
00:28:19.230,00:28:20.020,喂与公主喝下,00:28:19.220,00:28:20.640,We'll give it to the Princess that way.
00:28:20.650,00:28:21.480,这个办法可行,00:28:20.640,00:28:21.737,This is feasible.
00:28:23.570,00:28:25.230,娘娘惠妃已逝,00:28:23.560,00:28:25.454,"Your Highness, Consort Vertu has passed away."
00:28:26.280,00:28:28.770,娘娘再悲痛也要注意自己的身体,00:28:26.270,00:28:28.927,You should take care of your health even in the deepest grief.
00:28:31.960,00:28:34.660,本宫这两日总做梦,00:28:31.950,00:28:34.650,I've been having dreams every night.
00:28:36.790,00:28:38.620,总梦见从前未进宫时,00:28:36.780,00:28:38.877,Dreaming about the time with Meizhuang
00:28:39.170,00:28:40.710,和眉姐姐在一起的时候,00:28:39.160,00:28:40.967,before we entered the Palace.
00:28:43.220,00:28:46.000,本宫总觉得她还在,00:28:43.210,00:28:45.990,I feel that ... she's still nearby ...
00:28:48.010,00:28:49.090,娘娘忧思过度,00:28:48.000,00:28:49.600,Your Highness has slimmed down
00:28:49.770,00:28:50.800,人也瘦了不少,00:28:49.760,00:28:51.124,from over-grieving.
00:28:52.100,00:28:54.010,好歹皇上厚待惠妃,00:28:52.090,00:28:54.201,"After all, His Majesty treated Consort Vertu generously."
00:28:54.650,00:28:56.680,一切丧仪皆按贵妃仪制,00:28:54.400,00:28:56.670,Her funeral followed the protocol for a Noble Consort.
00:28:57.520,00:29:00.010,还让娘娘您亲自抚养静和公主,00:28:57.510,00:29:00.520,And His Majesty placed Princess Jinghe under Your Highness's care.
00:29:04.660,00:29:05.770,你师傅怎么样了,00:29:04.650,00:29:05.900,How's your shifu?
00:29:06.990,00:29:08.030,师傅身子废了,00:29:06.980,00:29:08.221,Shifu has lost his spirit
00:29:09.080,00:29:10.440,整个人精神都垮了,00:29:09.070,00:29:10.664,ever since he disabled his body.
00:29:12.000,00:29:14.240,整日里就知道喝酒,00:29:11.990,00:29:14.230,All he does is drink alcohol.
00:29:16.290,00:29:17.870,人去才知情深,00:29:16.280,00:29:18.320,What's the point of recognizing one's deep affection
00:29:18.710,00:29:19.670,还有什么意义,00:29:18.688,00:29:20.028,when the person is gone?
00:29:21.880,00:29:24.250,你替本宫多照看他,00:29:21.870,00:29:24.240,Look after him for me.
00:29:25.010,00:29:25.670,是娘娘,00:29:25.000,00:29:26.067,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:29:27.340,00:29:28.500,温实初这么一来,00:29:27.330,00:29:28.824,"Given Wen Shichu's condition,"
00:29:30.260,00:29:32.100,本宫身边可用的太医,00:29:30.451,00:29:32.291,the only doctor I can rely on
00:29:32.980,00:29:33.960,唯有你一个了,00:29:32.970,00:29:33.950,is you.
00:29:37.600,00:29:38.640,多谢娘娘台举,00:29:37.590,00:29:39.131,I thank Your Highness for your appreciation.
00:29:38.940,00:29:40.650,微臣必当尽心尽力,00:29:39.131,00:29:40.640,I will put forth my best effort.
00:29:41.940,00:29:43.180,你有此心最好,00:29:41.930,00:29:43.437,It's best if you truly will.
00:29:44.820,00:29:46.400,本宫必不会亏待了你,00:29:44.810,00:29:46.724,I won't treat you unfairly.
00:29:47.910,00:29:49.150,过两日请温实初,00:29:47.900,00:29:50.143,"Ask Wen Shichu to come here in a few days,"
00:29:50.450,00:29:52.320,给静和公主请平安脉,00:29:50.440,00:29:52.310,to take Princess Jinghe's pulse.
00:29:54.040,00:29:54.900,你知道轻重,00:29:54.030,00:29:55.673,You know how to make the request properly.
00:29:56.330,00:29:57.160,微臣知道,00:29:56.320,00:29:57.451,"I understand, Your Highness."
00:29:57.960,00:29:59.740,娘娘若没有其他盼咐,00:29:57.950,00:30:00.000,"Your Highness, if there's no other orders,"
00:30:00.090,00:30:00.820,微臣告退了,00:30:00.080,00:30:01.211,I shall take my leave.
00:30:01.550,00:30:02.160,去吧,00:30:01.540,00:30:02.451,Yes.
00:30:02.800,00:30:03.460,谢娘娘,00:30:02.790,00:30:03.450,I thank Your Highness.
00:30:13.180,00:30:14.470,给贵妃娘娘请安,00:30:13.170,00:30:14.761,Peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:30:15.770,00:30:16.720,苏公公请起,00:30:15.760,00:30:17.100,"Please rise, Mr. Su."
00:30:18.060,00:30:20.720,娘娘 皇上有东西赏赐,00:30:18.050,00:30:20.710,"Your Highness, His Majesty has a gift,"
00:30:21.980,00:30:23.600,不知二小姐可在,00:30:21.970,00:30:23.724,Is the Second Lady here?
00:30:24.740,00:30:25.820,去太后宫里了,00:30:24.796,00:30:26.478,She's in the Empress Dowager's palace.
00:30:27.110,00:30:29.150,那就请娘娘代二小姐收下吧,00:30:27.100,00:30:29.374,"Then please receive this gift for the Second Lady, Your Highness."
00:30:29.950,00:30:32.560,皇上赏赐的是宫中新制的,00:30:29.940,00:30:32.784,"His Majesty granted a pair of twin begonia tassels -
representing two sisters."
00:30:33.040,00:30:34.650,并蒂海棠步摇一对,00:30:33.030,00:30:34.874,They are newly crafted by palace jewelers.
00:30:35.160,00:30:37.320,褒奖二小姐勇闯皇后殿,00:30:35.150,00:30:39.235,"To reward the Second Lady for her courage when
protecting Your Noble Highness in the Empress’s palace."
00:30:37.580,00:30:38.950,护持贵妃的勇气,,,
00:30:43.050,00:30:44.410,替本宫多谢皇上,00:30:43.040,00:30:44.801,Please thank His Majesty profusely on my behalf.
00:30:45.590,00:30:46.370,奴才告退,00:30:45.580,00:30:46.867,Allow me to take my leave.
00:31:08.530,00:31:10.640,宝鹊的后事都打理好了吧,00:31:08.520,00:31:11.064,Have Sparrow's posthumous matters been taken care of?
00:31:11.990,00:31:12.850,都办好了,00:31:11.980,00:31:13.274,Everything's taken care of.
00:31:13.830,00:31:15.740,只是小主都这个时候了,00:31:13.820,00:31:16.031,"But My Lady, why are you only worrying about Sparrow"
00:31:16.240,00:31:17.530,你还只担心宝鹊,00:31:16.230,00:31:17.520,at this moment?
00:31:18.710,00:31:20.040,那我该担心什么,00:31:18.700,00:31:20.434,"Well then, what am I supposed to be worried about?"
00:31:20.540,00:31:22.500,小主皇上都好些日子,00:31:20.530,00:31:23.676,"My Lady, His Majesty hasn't been here
for quite some days now."
00:31:22.750,00:31:23.660,没来咱们这儿了,,,
00:31:24.340,00:31:26.950,您也不想想办法也不着急,00:31:24.330,00:31:27.450,"Aren't you worried?
Are you planning to do anything?"
00:31:27.460,00:31:28.800,有什么可着急的,00:31:27.450,00:31:29.225,What is there to be worried about?
00:31:30.340,00:31:32.550,皇上也不只是不来咱们这里,00:31:30.330,00:31:32.540,I'm not the only one His Majesty is avoiding.
00:31:35.100,00:31:37.210,他忙着为惠妃伤心呢,00:31:35.090,00:31:37.434,He's busy grieving over Consort Vertu.
00:31:38.560,00:31:39.550,不过你放心,00:31:38.550,00:31:39.834,"But you can rest assured,"
00:31:40.390,00:31:42.010,伤心几天也就好了,00:31:40.380,00:31:42.000,he won't be sad for too many days.
00:31:42.650,00:31:43.980,我还不知道皇上吗,00:31:42.450,00:31:44.134,I know His Majesty all too well.
00:31:47.570,00:31:50.020,小主恕奴婢直言,00:31:47.560,00:31:50.010,"However, in all due respect, My lady."
00:31:51.450,00:31:53.110,其实惠妃娘娘不死,00:31:51.440,00:31:53.601,"Even if Consort Vertu did not die,"
00:31:54.200,00:31:55.440,也碍不着咱们什么,00:31:54.190,00:31:55.430,she would never be in our way.
00:31:56.330,00:31:58.070,惠妃死不死不打紧,00:31:56.130,00:31:58.484,"Whether she had to die or not,"
00:31:59.370,00:32:02.960,只是她跟甄嬛那么要好,00:31:59.360,00:32:02.950,she was ... so close to Zhen Huan...
00:32:04.750,00:32:05.990,只有她死了,00:32:04.740,00:32:06.181,Only her death
00:32:06.880,00:32:08.910,甄嬛才会伤心欲绝,00:32:06.870,00:32:08.900,would sadden Zhen Huan to death.
00:32:11.300,00:32:13.160,只有看着甄嬛伤心,00:32:11.290,00:32:13.150,Only seeing Zhen Huan's misery
00:32:16.010,00:32:20.220,我心里这口气就顺畅了,00:32:16.000,00:32:20.210,can I finally be purged of the insult I swallowed.
00:32:26.400,00:32:27.640,惠妃姐姐,00:32:26.390,00:32:27.630,"Sister Vertu,"
00:32:29.730,00:32:31.320,算你枉死,00:32:29.720,00:32:31.562,suppose you did die in vain ...
,,,00:32:32.020,00:32:33.564,this cup of wine ...
00:32:32.030,00:32:36.020,这杯我敬您了,00:32:34.399,00:32:36.314,is my respect for you.
00:32:40.120,00:32:43.450,到了阎王爷跟前别忘了,00:32:40.110,00:32:43.440,Don't forget to tell the judge of the underworld that
00:32:44.750,00:32:46.790,是甄嬛害死你的,00:32:44.740,00:32:47.160,Zhen Huan was the one who really killed you.
00:33:04.350,00:33:05.930,朕不记得赏过你,00:33:04.340,00:33:06.121,I don't remember granting you
00:33:06.270,00:33:07.810,崔白的秋浦蓉宾图啊,00:33:06.260,00:33:08.067,"Cui Bai's painting ""Autumn Reeds, Hibiscuses and Geese""."
00:33:08.570,00:33:10.060,臣妾小妹涂鸦之作,00:33:08.560,00:33:10.317,This is my little sister's doodle.
00:33:10.730,00:33:11.940,皇上也被瞒过了吗,00:33:10.720,00:33:12.164,Did it fool Your Majesty?
00:33:12.650,00:33:15.490,就是那日闯入皇后殿的女子吗,00:33:12.640,00:33:15.480,Your sister who strode into the Empress's Palace?
00:33:17.160,00:33:19.940,朕赏了她首饰她还未谢恩呢,00:33:17.150,00:33:20.231,She hasn't thanked me for the jewelry I gifted her yet.
00:33:20.540,00:33:23.070,今日在你宫里她可不能托赖了,00:33:20.530,00:33:23.060,"She can't delay further, since I'm here in your palace."
00:33:27.670,00:33:28.500,皇上万安,00:33:27.660,00:33:28.858,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:33:31.250,00:33:33.670,朕赐你的步摇不喜欢吗,00:33:31.240,00:33:33.660,Do you dislike the tassels I granted you?
00:33:34.130,00:33:34.750,也不戴上,00:33:33.953,00:33:35.170,You aren't wearing them.
00:33:35.180,00:33:36.590,她素日不爱这些金器,00:33:35.170,00:33:36.747,She doesn't like gold and jewelry.
00:33:36.970,00:33:37.960,所以不曾戴上,00:33:36.960,00:33:38.619,That's why she never put them on.
00:33:39.470,00:33:41.550,皇上赏赐你还没谢恩呢,00:33:39.460,00:33:41.674,You haven't thanked His Majesty yet.
00:33:42.600,00:33:44.680,臣女不仅不喜欢金器首饰,00:33:42.590,00:33:45.034,"Not only do I dislike gold and jewelry,"
00:33:45.230,00:33:46.970,而且那步摇上的海棠花,00:33:45.220,00:33:47.194,the begonia flowers on the tassels
00:33:47.350,00:33:48.310,是姐姐所钟爱的,00:33:47.340,00:33:48.901,are my sister's favorite flowers.
00:33:49.060,00:33:51.560,姐姐喜爱的 臣女不会沾染毫分,00:33:49.050,00:33:51.684,I would never infringe on her favored things.
00:33:52.900,00:33:53.690,那也罢了,00:33:52.890,00:33:54.048,Never mind then.
00:33:54.690,00:33:55.770,你擅长作画,00:33:54.680,00:33:56.432,You are talented at painting.
00:33:56.660,00:33:59.070,可愿意跟宫中的画师切磋吗,00:33:56.650,00:33:59.060,Would you like to explore your skills with the palace artists?
00:33:59.570,00:34:00.650,朕可以替你安排,00:33:59.560,00:34:00.980,I can arrange that for you.
00:34:00.990,00:34:03.320,宫中画师多崇富丽辉煌的色彩,00:34:01.000,00:34:03.310,The palace artists prefer opulent colors in their paintings.
00:34:04.000,00:34:06.240,皇上看臣女临摹崔白之画,00:34:03.990,00:34:06.230,Your Majesty saw my replication of Cui Bai's painting
00:34:06.500,00:34:09.160,就知道臣女与画师必定话不投机,00:34:06.490,00:34:10.201,"and should know the palace artists and I
aren't likely to have an agreeable session."
00:34:11.130,00:34:12.540,你大雁画得特别好,00:34:11.120,00:34:12.797,Your drawing of the wild geese is very good.
00:34:14.170,00:34:15.750,臣女喜欢忠贞之鸟,00:34:14.160,00:34:16.134,I like birds that represent loyalty.
00:34:19.840,00:34:21.930,你得空去如意馆,00:34:19.830,00:34:22.337,Go to the Ruyi Pavilion when you get a chance.
00:34:22.180,00:34:24.720,把崔白的秋浦蓉宾图的真述拿来,00:34:22.337,00:34:25.011,"You can retrieve the original painting of
""Autumn Reeds, Hibiscuses and Geese""."
00:34:25.480,00:34:28.010,这幅图允礼与允禧都喜欢,00:34:25.470,00:34:28.000,Both Yunli and Yunxi like this painting.
00:34:28.560,00:34:29.850,跟朕要了很多次,00:34:28.550,00:34:30.274,They've asked me to give it to them many times.
00:34:30.520,00:34:31.640,现在朕就赐给你,00:34:30.510,00:34:32.298,I'm granting it to you right now.
00:34:32.570,00:34:33.350,多谢皇上,00:34:32.560,00:34:33.708,I thank Your Majesty.
00:34:42.660,00:34:43.870,这画是好意头,00:34:42.650,00:34:44.361,This painting has an auspicious implication.
00:34:45.080,00:34:46.990,臣妾也希望来日小妹成婚,00:34:45.070,00:34:48.300,I hope Yurao won't be far away from me after she gets married one day.
00:34:47.290,00:34:48.280,不要离臣妾太远,,,
00:34:49.370,00:34:50.330,就如这画中,,,
00:34:51.040,00:34:52.410,大雁在芙蓉花畔,00:34:49.360,00:34:52.434,"Just like the geese are close to the hibiscus flowers in the painting,"
00:34:53.170,00:34:55.330,若是姐妹分离又有什么趣儿,00:34:53.160,00:34:55.500,I hope to always live near to my sister.
00:35:15.320,00:35:15.850,巧啊,00:35:15.167,00:35:16.235,How coincidental!
00:35:16.440,00:35:18.430,什么巧是冤家路窄吧,00:35:16.430,00:35:18.800,"I would say ""Enemies always meet on a narrow road."""
00:35:19.320,00:35:20.610,不是冤家不聚头嘛,00:35:19.310,00:35:21.436,"Well, you can never avoid your enemies."
00:35:23.830,00:35:26.160,皇兄把秋浦蓉宾图赏了你,00:35:23.500,00:35:26.534,"His Majesty rewarded you
""Autumn Reeds, Hibiscuses and Geese""?"
00:35:27.120,00:35:28.780,拿这个哄姐姐开心的,00:35:27.110,00:35:28.937,To make my sister happy.
00:35:30.250,00:35:32.240,我向皇兄求这幅画求了很久,00:35:30.240,00:35:33.867,"I requested this painting from His Majesty many times
but he was always reluctant."
00:35:32.880,00:35:33.710,皇兄也舍不得,,,
00:35:35.250,00:35:36.990,终究他最看重贵妃,00:35:35.034,00:35:37.501,"After all, he appreciates Her Noble Highness the most."
00:35:37.920,00:35:39.380,怎么你也喜欢这画,00:35:37.910,00:35:39.571,So you also like this painting?
00:35:40.510,00:35:41.370,旁的也就罢了,,,
00:35:41.890,00:35:42.840,那双大雁最好,00:35:40.500,00:35:43.034,"Particularly the pair of geese, more than everything else."
00:35:43.680,00:35:45.040,渺万里层云,00:35:43.493,00:35:45.300,"""Through the evening snow on the thousand mountains,"""
00:35:45.310,00:35:47.920,千山暮雪只影向谁去,00:35:45.300,00:35:48.667,"""Through the evening snow on the thousand mountains,
to whom should the widowed goose fly?"""
00:35:48.730,00:35:49.640,你也爱读词啊,00:35:48.720,00:35:49.840,You also like to read lyric poetry?
00:35:49.850,00:35:51.890,元好问的好词唯此一阕了,00:35:49.840,00:35:51.880,Yuan Haowen only had this one good poem.
00:35:52.980,00:35:54.190,大雁是忠贞之鸟,00:35:52.970,00:35:54.414,Geese are birds of loyalty.
00:35:54.690,00:35:55.600,所以我喜欢,00:35:54.680,00:35:56.000,That's why I like them.
00:35:59.490,00:36:02.350,对了多谢你那晚为姐姐解围,00:35:59.480,00:36:02.568,"By the way, thank you for helping my sister the other night."
00:36:03.110,00:36:04.320,不必了应该的,00:36:03.100,00:36:04.444,Don't thank me. I felt obliged to.
00:36:05.490,00:36:07.900,只是这一谢隔了好久啊,00:36:05.480,00:36:08.300,"But it took quite a while to hear you say ""thank you""."
00:36:10.500,00:36:11.410,你若真要谢我,,,
00:36:11.670,00:36:13.330,不如把这幅画给我细赏如何,00:36:10.490,00:36:13.620,"If you really mean to thank me,
can you let me admire the details of this painting?"
00:36:13.630,00:36:14.240,好啊,00:36:13.620,00:36:14.397,Sure.
00:36:25.800,00:36:26.710,崔白的笔法,,,
00:36:26.970,00:36:28.930,一改北宋画苑浮华奢靡之气,00:36:25.790,00:36:29.586,"Cui Bai abandoned the sumptuous style
of the court painters in the Northern Song Dynasty"
00:36:30.270,00:36:31.300,力求写实逼真,00:36:30.221,00:36:31.701,in favor of greater realism.
00:36:31.940,00:36:33.890,如此才能传神,00:36:31.930,00:36:34.047,The result is this lifelike painting.
00:36:34.520,00:36:36.350,原来你也不是不学无术啊,00:36:34.510,00:36:37.243,"It turns out that you aren't entirely a
 ""learn nothing, know nothing."""
00:36:38.230,00:36:39.270,我不学无术,00:36:38.220,00:36:40.000,"""Learn nothing, know nothing""?"
00:36:40.320,00:36:42.180,不如我们来比比画技如何,00:36:40.310,00:36:42.440,How about we have a painting competition?
00:36:42.450,00:36:43.400,好画什么,00:36:42.440,00:36:43.691,"Sure, what should we paint?"
00:36:44.160,00:36:45.820,画春景吧,00:36:44.150,00:36:46.111,Let's paint ... the spring scenery.
00:36:46.570,00:36:47.110,行,00:36:46.560,00:36:47.301,Certainly.
00:36:47.660,00:36:48.520,我们去如意馆画,00:36:47.650,00:36:48.900,We are going to the Ruyi Pavilion.
00:36:48.910,00:36:49.490,嘛,00:36:48.900,00:36:49.480,Aye.
00:36:54.250,00:36:55.910,听说皇上冷落了安嫔她们,00:36:54.506,00:36:56.376,I heard that His Majesty has been neglecting Concubine An.
00:36:56.750,00:36:57.830,只是便宜了皇后,00:36:56.740,00:36:58.254,Yet the Empress has gotten away with everything.
00:36:58.670,00:37:00.210,皇上竟然这样轻轻放过,,,
00:37:00.510,00:37:01.490,这也太是非不分了,00:36:58.660,00:37:02.160,"His Majesty forgave her so easily.
 It's as if he can't distinguish between right and wrong!"
00:37:02.170,00:37:03.500,皇上不是不明是非,,,
00:37:04.180,00:37:06.010,而是顾念纯元皇后旧情,00:37:02.160,00:37:07.867,"Of course His Majesty knows right from wrong, but he also
cares about Empress Première and the Empress Dowager."
00:37:06.590,00:37:07.880,又有太后那边护着,,,
00:37:08.430,00:37:09.260,心不由己,00:37:08.534,00:37:10.325,His decision didn't reflect his own will.
00:37:15.560,00:37:17.850,微臣温实初给熹贵妃请安,00:37:15.550,00:37:18.074,Wen Shichu bids peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:37:18.270,00:37:19.430,还没进来就一身酒气,00:37:18.260,00:37:19.850,I smelled alcohol before you even came in.
00:37:19.860,00:37:20.770,也不怕黑着静和,00:37:19.850,00:37:21.255,It might disturb Jinghe.
00:37:21.530,00:37:22.360,心死之人,,,
00:37:23.610,00:37:25.820,哪还顾得上什么梳洗打扮,00:37:21.520,00:37:25.800,A man with a dead heart ... wouldn't care about washing and dressing nicely.
00:37:27.950,00:37:28.560,你抱抱,00:37:27.940,00:37:29.085,Hold her in your arms.
00:37:29.910,00:37:31.020,孩子已经重了些了,00:37:29.900,00:37:31.311,She has gained some weight.
00:37:38.460,00:37:39.700,公主健康无虞,00:37:38.450,00:37:40.000,The princess is very healthy.
00:37:40.800,00:37:42.250,多谢娘娘悉心照料,00:37:40.790,00:37:42.474,I thank Your Highness for taking good care of her.
00:37:43.590,00:37:44.830,本宫再怎么照顾,,,
00:37:45.430,00:37:47.010,终究不是她的亲生父母,00:37:43.580,00:37:47.334,"No matter how much I take care of her,
I can't replace her parents."
00:37:48.300,00:37:50.420,这孩子每到黄昏时刻便会大哭,00:37:48.290,00:37:50.644,Jinghe cries loudly at dawn every day.
00:37:51.430,00:37:53.340,也不知道是不是在想念眉姐姐,00:37:51.420,00:37:53.330,I wonder if it's because she misses Meizhuang.
00:37:54.310,00:37:55.420,那日眉庄入棺,00:37:54.300,00:37:56.000,"On the day when Meizhuang was encoffined,"
00:37:57.560,00:37:59.050,我把我的家传玉壶,00:37:57.550,00:38:00.968,I put my heirloom jade teapot in her coffin.
00:37:59.690,00:38:00.850,放进了她的棺内,,,
00:38:02.150,00:38:03.640,或许我早就该给她,00:38:02.140,00:38:04.102,Perhaps I should have given her the jade teapot earlier.
00:38:05.070,00:38:06.530,是我自己太糊涂,,,
00:38:07.990,00:38:09.700,以至于她抱憾了那么多年,00:38:05.060,00:38:09.667,I was so stupid ... to have made her rueful for so many years.
00:38:11.120,00:38:11.900,这辈子,00:38:11.110,00:38:12.800,In this life ...
00:38:14.000,00:38:15.610,总是我对不住她,00:38:13.627,00:38:15.600,I owe her so much.
00:38:17.210,00:38:19.740,姐姐虽已去但静和还在,00:38:17.200,00:38:20.000,"Although Meizhuang is gone, you still have Jinghe."
00:38:20.920,00:38:22.280,你总得为孩子打算,00:38:20.910,00:38:22.537,You have to plan for the child.
00:38:23.300,00:38:24.910,难道你还要终日醉酒吗,00:38:23.290,00:38:25.301,Are you going to keep drinking every day?
00:38:26.170,00:38:27.540,我一辈子也忘不了,00:38:26.160,00:38:28.163,I can never forget
00:38:28.510,00:38:30.550,她靠在我怀里去了的时候的,00:38:28.597,00:38:31.901,the feeling when she passed away in my arms.
00:38:30.890,00:38:31.670,那种感觉,,,
00:38:34.350,00:38:35.090,嬛妹妹,00:38:34.340,00:38:35.347,"Huan'er,"
00:38:36.940,00:38:39.430,守护你已经成了我的一种习惯,00:38:36.930,00:38:39.420,"I developed the habit of looking out for you,"
00:38:40.480,00:38:42.100,习惯是不容易改变的,00:38:40.470,00:38:42.190,and it's hard to change any habit.
00:38:44.030,00:38:45.010,而对于眉庄,00:38:44.020,00:38:45.201,"But for Meizhuang,"
00:38:46.360,00:38:47.230,她在这深宫里的,,,
00:38:47.530,00:38:49.110,每一分寂寞和执着,00:38:46.350,00:38:51.034,"I could feel her loneliness and struggle in the harem
as if it was my own."
00:38:49.820,00:38:51.060,我都感同身受,,,
00:38:52.120,00:38:55.150,她守护我就像我这么多年来,00:38:52.110,00:38:56.634,She cared for me in the same way I had been for you.
00:38:55.500,00:38:56.660,一直在守护你一样,,,
00:38:57.580,00:38:59.040,我已经向皇上请旨,00:38:57.570,00:38:59.560,I have requested that His Majesty
00:39:01.840,00:39:05.250,以失职之罪去为她守梓宫三年,00:39:01.604,00:39:06.419,"send me to guard her ""catalpa palace"" [coffin] for three years
as punishment for failing in my duty."
00:39:07.670,00:39:08.960,我明白实初哥哥,00:39:07.660,00:39:08.950,"I understand, Shichu."
00:39:09.510,00:39:10.620,只是逝者已去,00:39:09.500,00:39:10.978,But the dead have passed on.
00:39:11.550,00:39:13.760,生者不得不活下来担当一切,00:39:11.540,00:39:13.750,The living have to live on and bear it all.
00:39:15.850,00:39:16.880,你要好好活着,,,
00:39:17.980,00:39:20.810,姐姐在九泉之下才能有所安慰,00:39:15.840,00:39:20.867,"You must live well, so that Meizhuang
can find consolation ""under the Yellow Spring""."
00:39:28.280,00:39:29.610,自从惠妃死后,00:39:28.270,00:39:30.000,"Since Consort Vertu's death,"
00:39:30.660,00:39:32.490,皇上就来了延禧宫一次,00:39:30.650,00:39:33.360,His Majesty has only visited the Palace of Prolonging Happiness once
00:39:34.200,00:39:35.570,而且略坐坐就走了,00:39:34.262,00:39:36.101,and he left after sitting down briefly.
00:39:36.540,00:39:38.320,你说这些本宫都知道,00:39:36.530,00:39:38.577,I know what you're trying to say.
00:39:39.290,00:39:42.080,你去摸摸景仁宫的墙壁和地砖,00:39:39.280,00:39:42.371,Feel the walls and the floor of the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:39:43.170,00:39:45.500,冷得像冰窖一样,00:39:43.160,00:39:45.490,They are as cold as an icehouse.
00:39:47.340,00:39:50.750,过了端午了皇上一次也没来,00:39:47.330,00:39:50.941,"It's already past the Dragon Boat Festival.
His Majesty hasn't even visited once."
00:39:58.020,00:40:00.050,自己的恩宠自己去争,00:39:58.010,00:40:00.274,You have to earn the favor you deserve.
00:40:00.480,00:40:01.220,难不成,,,
00:40:01.690,00:40:04.680,还要本宫拖着皇上来你宫中坐吗,00:40:00.470,00:40:04.667,"Or, do you think I can drag His Majesty to sit in your palace?"
00:40:05.820,00:40:06.730,娘娘放心,00:40:05.810,00:40:07.121,"Rest assured, Your Majesty."
00:40:07.530,00:40:08.610,有臣妾一日,00:40:07.520,00:40:09.228,"Each day I'm alive,"
00:40:09.240,00:40:11.900,绝不会让熹贵妃如此快活,00:40:09.228,00:40:11.867,Noble Consort Lumière won't have it so easy.
00:40:12.860,00:40:13.650,好了,00:40:12.850,00:40:13.974,All right.
00:40:14.530,00:40:17.650,本宫提拔你是对你含了指望,00:40:14.520,00:40:17.640,I've been helping you because I have expectations for you.
00:40:18.490,00:40:20.200,别辜负了本宫的指望,00:40:18.480,00:40:20.634,Don't disappoint my expectations.
00:40:21.500,00:40:24.240,娘娘的指望便是臣妾的指望,00:40:21.490,00:40:24.364,What Your Majesty expects is what I look forward to.
00:40:30.670,00:40:32.380,皇上驾到,00:40:30.660,00:40:32.370,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:40:36.220,00:40:38.960,臣妾给皇上请安皇上万福金安,00:40:36.210,00:40:37.915,I bow before Your Majesty.
,,,00:40:37.915,00:40:39.517,"- Rise.
- Peace and grace to Your Majesty."
00:40:40.180,00:40:40.890,起来吧,00:40:40.170,00:40:41.147,Please rise.
00:40:44.350,00:40:45.590,你素日最怕热,00:40:44.340,00:40:46.050,You are always sensitive to the heat.
00:40:46.060,00:40:48.350,本该带你去圆明园消暑的,00:40:46.050,00:40:48.720,I should've taken you to the Summer Palace to escape the heat.
00:40:48.730,00:40:50.940,不当家怎知柴米艰难,00:40:48.720,00:40:51.866,"""Only the housekeeper knows the costs of charcoal and rice."""
00:40:52.610,00:40:54.690,太后身上不痛快不宜远行,00:40:52.600,00:40:55.636,"Her Majesty the Empress Dowager is feeling unwell
and shouldn't go for a long trip."
00:40:56.070,00:40:58.110,臣妾身边这几个孩子若都带上,00:40:56.060,00:40:59.678,And it's not easy to travel with all these children under my care
00:40:58.580,00:40:59.530,也不是易事,,,
00:41:00.540,00:41:02.450,乳母保姆便是一大堆人,00:41:00.480,00:41:02.534,and a mass of maids and wet nurses.
00:41:03.500,00:41:05.830,圆明园那边又要重新着人布置,00:41:03.490,00:41:05.954,We would also need to have the Summer Palace rearranged.
00:41:06.420,00:41:08.620,也都是海样的银子流水价出去,00:41:06.410,00:41:08.610,Then the money will flow away like the running river.
00:41:09.590,00:41:10.450,你倒俭省,00:41:09.580,00:41:10.808,You've been frugal.
00:41:11.510,00:41:13.840,朕看了这个月宫里出账的银子,00:41:11.500,00:41:16.067,"I reviewed the palace expenses for this month.
They went down over seven thousand taels over last month."
00:41:14.180,00:41:16.090,倒比上个月省了七千多两,,,
00:41:16.470,00:41:18.510,自是你勤俭持家的好处,00:41:16.460,00:41:18.500,That's the merit of your frugality.
00:41:19.850,00:41:20.960,皇上先别高兴,00:41:19.840,00:41:21.618,"It's too early to be glad, Your Majesty."
00:41:21.770,00:41:22.550,等什么时候,,,
00:41:23.350,00:41:24.970,皇上多选几位妹妹进来,00:41:21.760,00:41:28.667,"If Your Majesty selects several new concubines one day,
even ten thousand taels won't cover the cost."
00:41:25.600,00:41:27.340,这银子上多花上一万两,,,
00:41:27.730,00:41:28.690,也是不够开销的,,,
00:41:30.780,00:41:32.610,朕听着这话很酸哪,00:41:30.770,00:41:32.934,I sense some sourness in your words.
00:41:33.740,00:41:35.980,你若想在这项上省银子,00:41:33.730,00:41:36.462,"If you want to save money on that,"
00:41:37.070,00:41:38.560,朕告诉你一个妙宗儿,00:41:37.130,00:41:38.834,I can tell you the trick.
00:41:39.490,00:41:42.450,朕只往你宫里娶几个宫女做答应,00:41:39.480,00:41:42.534,"How about I promote several maids from your palace to Companions,"
00:41:43.450,00:41:44.940,她们的月例银子,00:41:43.440,00:41:46.667,and their monthly stipends will be deducted from your stipend.
00:41:45.250,00:41:46.530,就在你的例银里扣,,,
00:41:47.290,00:41:48.780,皇上爱娶谁娶谁去,00:41:47.514,00:41:49.438,Your Majesty can marry whoever pleases you.
00:41:49.960,00:41:51.750,皇上要几个答应什么稀罕的,00:41:49.950,00:41:52.007,It's not rare to have several new Companions.
00:41:52.630,00:41:53.920,若真有看得入眼的,,,
00:41:54.420,00:41:56.010,一举封为贵人那才好呢,00:41:52.620,00:41:56.000,"If someone really catches your eye,
you should promote her directly to Noble Lady."
00:41:56.930,00:41:58.130,你若真这么大方,,,
00:41:58.640,00:42:00.670,朕今日就娶了浣碧去吧,00:41:56.920,00:42:00.634,"If you are so generous, how about I marry Jade today?"
00:42:01.510,00:42:02.220,你看如何,00:42:01.500,00:42:02.544,What do you think?
00:42:04.140,00:42:06.720,臣妾的陪嫁丫鬓就剩浣碧一个了,00:42:04.130,00:42:08.268,"Jade is my only dowry maid now.
Is Your Majesty going to take her away from me?"
00:42:07.150,00:42:08.130,皇上也要夺爱吗,,,
00:42:08.480,00:42:10.390,正因为是你的亲信,00:42:08.470,00:42:12.500,"It's exactly because she has your trust
that I must treat her generously."
00:42:10.940,00:42:12.520,朕才不会薄待她,,,
00:42:13.400,00:42:16.140,就和你当年一样封为常在如何,00:42:13.390,00:42:16.367,"How about granting her the title of Attendant,
just like when you entered the palace?"
00:42:16.820,00:42:19.030,就封为禧常在吧,00:42:16.810,00:42:19.020,I'll name her Attendant Xi [Auspicious].

00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:58.990,00:43:18.990,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:18.990,00:43:35.990,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."
00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"I loved you with my body and soul
But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:35.990,00:43:53.990,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran athwart
and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:53.990,00:44:01.990,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:01.990,00:44:13.990,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:13.990,00:44:32.990,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
00:44:33.000,00:44:41.000,"You can hear the flapping of a phoenix
but you will never see it.",00:44:32.990,00:44:40.990,"A phoenix about to take flight rustles its wings
but the arc of its flight is unseen."
00:44:41.000,00:44:47.600,What you see is the falling leaves from the phoenix tree.,00:44:40.990,00:44:47.590,"The phoenix tree sways in the wind,
shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
00:44:51.000,00:45:04.000,The falling leaves from the phoenix tree.,00:44:50.990,00:45:03.990,"The phoenix tree sways in the wind,
shedding memories in the whispers of the falling leaves."
