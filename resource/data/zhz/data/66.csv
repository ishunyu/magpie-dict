00:02:23.060,00:02:25.640,今日是惠妃尾七的祭礼,00:02:23.060,00:02:26.319,Today's rites honor the seventh week since Consort Vietu's death.
00:02:26.520,00:02:27.550,预备得怎么样了,00:02:26.520,00:02:28.140,How are the preparations going?
00:02:28.140,00:02:28.760,好了,00:02:28.140,00:02:29.364,All complete.
00:02:30.100,00:02:31.760,宝华殿已经进行法事了,00:02:30.100,00:02:32.175,Baohua Hall has already started the ritual.
00:02:33.400,00:02:34.510,只是臣妾想,00:02:33.400,00:02:35.000,But I've been thinking
00:02:35.440,00:02:36.400,一场法事,,,
00:02:37.240,00:02:38.940,不足以安慰姐姐在天之灵,00:02:35.440,00:02:38.940,a ritual alone is not enough to console Vertu's spirit in Heaven.
00:02:40.660,00:02:42.610,你当时已 已经下令,00:02:40.660,00:02:44.530,"At that time, you ordered that Jingbai and Feiwen
be executed by flogging."
00:02:42.870,00:02:44.530,杖杀了静白与斐雯,,,
00:02:45.540,00:02:46.780,臣妾犹嫌不足,00:02:45.540,00:02:47.006,I no longer find that sufficient.
00:02:48.000,00:02:50.160,瓜尔佳氏挑拨六宫不和,00:02:48.000,00:02:50.670,"Gūwalgiya stirred up disharmony in the harem,"
00:02:50.670,00:02:52.780,她阿玛就在前朝兴风作浪,00:02:50.670,00:02:53.082,while her father “created winds and waves” in the court.
00:02:53.290,00:02:54.660,父女俩蛇鼠一窝,00:02:53.290,00:02:55.452,"Those two are ""rats and serpents from the same den."""
00:02:54.960,00:02:56.830,要将咱们全家置于死地吗,00:02:55.452,00:02:57.396,Are they putting our entire family on the path to damnation?
00:02:57.960,00:02:59.300,朕知道你不喜欢,00:02:57.960,00:02:59.602,"I know you are displeased,"
00:03:01.340,00:03:02.830,可是后宫与前朝,00:03:01.340,00:03:03.315,but with the harem and the court ...
00:03:03.100,00:03:05.800,往往是牵一发而动全身,00:03:03.315,00:03:06.064,"“when you pull a single hair, it affects the whole body.”"
00:03:06.680,00:03:08.170,事不能急,00:03:06.680,00:03:09.080,This matter cannot be rushed.
00:03:10.940,00:03:12.970,你的名字是玉娆,00:03:10.940,00:03:13.234,Isn't your name Yurao?
00:03:14.110,00:03:15.100,皇上明知故问,00:03:14.110,00:03:15.880,Your Majesty already knows that.
00:03:17.030,00:03:21.820,娆者 主娇娆妩媚,00:03:17.030,00:03:21.820,The character 娆 [rao] means enchanting and soft.
00:03:22.610,00:03:23.400,美则美矣,00:03:22.610,00:03:24.000,"The name is beautiful,"
00:03:23.950,00:03:26.530,却与你的刚烈性子不太相符,00:03:24.000,00:03:26.530,but it doesn't match your fiery personality.
00:03:27.660,00:03:30.700,女子温婉柔和,00:03:27.660,00:03:30.700,Women should be gentle and even-tempered.
00:03:31.580,00:03:35.950,朕赐你一名 叫玉婉好不好,00:03:31.580,00:03:35.915,How about I grant you the name Yurissé?
00:03:37.170,00:03:39.880,婉字也就罢了 可有什么出处吗,00:03:37.170,00:03:40.160,"I don't mind the name Yurissé, but remind me where it comes from."
00:03:40.760,00:03:42.120,总不能说皇上赐名,,,
00:03:42.430,00:03:44.170,是随便检了个字来送了三妹,00:03:40.760,00:03:44.571,"After all, Your Majesty can't arbitrarily pick a name
and give it to my third sister."
00:03:45.760,00:03:49.720,扬绰约之丽姿 怀婉娩之柔情,00:03:45.760,00:03:50.000,"""Yurissé displayed the beauty of grace and gentleness,
and nurtured feelings of caring tenderness."""
00:03:50.520,00:03:51.850,张华的永怀赋,00:03:50.520,00:03:52.456,"From ""Poem of the Eternal Reminiscence"" by Zhang Hua."
00:03:52.230,00:03:54.890,可是褒扬美人的句子 如何,00:03:52.456,00:03:55.361,This is a line praising the beautiful lady. What do you think?
00:03:56.060,00:03:58.650,美淑人之妖艳 因盼睐而倾城,00:03:56.060,00:03:58.980,"""The fair lady's beauty was enchanting;
she could level a city with an affectionate glance."""
00:03:58.980,00:04:00.940,这篇永怀赋乃是悼亡之作,00:03:58.980,00:04:01.700,"The ""Poem of the Eternal Reminiscence""
was written to mourn the deceased."
00:04:01.700,00:04:04.060,臣女还活生生站在皇上眼前呢,00:04:01.889,00:04:04.438,I am alive and standing right before Your Majesty.
00:04:05.620,00:04:07.360,朕不过是打个比方,00:04:05.620,00:04:07.700,I was only drawing an analogy.
00:04:07.950,00:04:10.490,既惠余以至欢 又结我以同心,00:04:07.950,00:04:10.910,"“She brought me unsurpassed joy,
and united with me in heart and mind."""
00:04:10.910,00:04:13.700,交恩好之款固 接情爱之分深,00:04:10.910,00:04:13.920,"""Our bond was strong and deep,
so was our love and connection.”"
00:04:14.880,00:04:17.960,张华的永怀赋乃是悼念亡妻,00:04:14.880,00:04:18.356,Zhang Hua wrote this poem to mourn his late wife.
00:04:19.210,00:04:19.790,皇上,00:04:19.210,00:04:20.869,Your Majesty can't be ...
00:04:20.510,00:04:22.920,您不会是有以玉蛲为妻之心吧,00:04:20.869,00:04:23.429,intending to take Yurao as your wife?
00:04:27.510,00:04:32.050,宫中妻妾嫡庶之分甚为分明,00:04:27.510,00:04:32.077,"In the harem, the distinction is particularly clear
between wife and concubines."
00:04:33.020,00:04:36.140,妻者惟中宫皇后 朕无此心,00:04:32.869,00:04:36.326,"The wife is the Empress - the head of the harem.
I don't have that intention."
00:04:36.900,00:04:38.560,只是 臣妾福薄无德,00:04:36.515,00:04:37.487,However...
00:04:39.190,00:04:41.180,甘居妾妃之位 侍奉皇上终身,00:04:37.487,00:04:41.435,"I lack blessings and virtues.
I am willing to serve Your Majesty as a concubine my entire life."
00:04:41.990,00:04:43.730,而玉娆性子高傲,00:04:41.699,00:04:44.200,"However, Yurao has too much pride."
00:04:44.200,00:04:46.440,必不能为人妾室侍奉左右,00:04:44.200,00:04:46.880,She cannot be a concubine and serve by someone's side.
00:04:48.410,00:04:51.490,你虽为妾室 却是朕的爱妾,00:04:48.410,00:04:51.747,"Even though you are my concubine, you are my favorite one."
00:04:52.200,00:04:55.450,又贵为贵妃一人之下而已,00:04:52.200,00:04:55.894,"And you are the distinguished Noble Consort,
second only to the Empress."
00:04:56.120,00:04:59.240,你妹妹若得如此 也不算辜负,00:04:56.120,00:04:59.680,"If your sister gains the same honor, that would not be a mistreatment."
00:04:59.960,00:05:02.540,臣妾的二妹虽得十七爷钟爱,00:04:59.960,00:05:03.090,"Although my second sister Yuyin is loved by Lord XVII,"
00:05:03.090,00:05:04.420,却也是侧福晋之位,00:05:03.090,00:05:05.163,she is only the Lord Consort.
00:05:05.970,00:05:07.830,臣妾并无觊觎后位之心,00:05:05.970,00:05:08.430,"For myself, I do not covet the throne of the Empress."
00:05:08.430,00:05:09.090,只是皇上,00:05:08.430,00:05:09.357,But Your Majesty ...
00:05:10.060,00:05:11.590,你难道忍心看臣妾的姐妹,00:05:10.000,00:05:13.071,can you bear seeing all of my sisters become secondary wives?
00:05:11.890,00:05:12.800,都为人妾室吗,,,
00:05:19.900,00:05:21.390,不过是赐名而已,00:05:19.900,00:05:22.778,I was just thinking of an honorary name for her.
00:05:23.190,00:05:25.150,倒好端端地惹起你伤心了,00:05:23.190,00:05:25.829,I did not mean to upset you.
00:05:26.780,00:05:28.150,可见是朕莽撞,00:05:26.780,00:05:28.549,Clearly I was too rash.
00:05:28.780,00:05:30.520,这婉字不好 咱们以后不提了,00:05:28.780,00:05:31.301,"Yurissé is not a fitting name.
We shall not speak of it again."
00:05:32.290,00:05:33.450,你妹妹还小,00:05:32.290,00:05:33.830,Your sister is still young.
00:05:33.830,00:05:35.440,日后若有好人家,00:05:33.830,00:05:36.319,One day I will find a match for her from a deserving family.
00:05:35.750,00:05:37.910,朕再好好为她留心,00:05:36.319,00:05:38.306,I will watch out for her.
00:05:39.000,00:05:40.410,眼下不说了,00:05:39.000,00:05:40.712,Let's stop talking about this now.
00:05:42.590,00:05:44.540,玉娆幼年见家中变故,00:05:42.590,00:05:44.880,I witnessed great misfortune in my family when I was young.
00:05:44.880,00:05:45.960,皇上刚才问玉娆,,,
00:05:46.220,00:05:47.550,为何性子如此刚烈,00:05:44.920,00:05:47.930,Your Majesty asked about my unyielding personality.
00:05:47.930,00:05:49.880,你若知道妾身幼年之事,00:05:47.960,00:05:50.350,"If Your Majesty heard of the incidents in my childhood,"
00:05:50.350,00:05:52.680,玉娆与父母如何远上甯古塔的,00:05:50.350,00:05:54.470,"how my parents and I journeyed north to Ningguta
and suffered all kinds of hardships,"
00:05:52.970,00:05:54.090,如何受尽辛苦的,,,
00:05:54.470,00:05:55.210,便有了答案,00:05:54.470,00:05:55.935,Your Majesty would understand.
00:05:57.270,00:05:58.480,朕愿意一听,00:05:57.270,00:05:58.706,I am willing to listen.
00:06:04.230,00:06:05.900,皇上起驾,00:06:04.230,00:06:06.013,His Majesty departs.
00:06:08.200,00:06:09.650,臣妾恭送皇上,00:06:08.200,00:06:10.000,I bid Your Majesty farewell.
00:06:21.000,00:06:22.080,皇上没说别的,00:06:21.000,00:06:22.500,His Majesty did not say anything.
00:06:22.500,00:06:23.960,只把这个放在我手里,,,
00:06:24.500,00:06:26.040,说过些日子再取回,00:06:22.651,00:06:26.743,"He just gave this to me,
and said he will retrieve it in a few days."
00:06:27.590,00:06:28.580,这枚鸳鸯佩,00:06:27.590,00:06:30.240,This jade pendant of a pair of mandarin ducks...
00:06:30.140,00:06:31.720,是皇上的贴身之物,00:06:30.302,00:06:32.172,His Majesty always wears it close to his body.
00:06:32.600,00:06:34.050,所以 长姐,00:06:32.600,00:06:35.523,"That's why, elder sister, I can't keep this."
00:06:34.260,00:06:35.220,这东西我留不得,,,
00:06:37.020,00:06:38.850,这玉佩皇上异常珍视,00:06:37.020,00:06:39.455,His Majesty cherishes this pendant most dearly.
00:06:40.650,00:06:41.260,玉娆,00:06:40.650,00:06:41.600,Yurao.
00:06:42.560,00:06:44.600,大约你长得太像纯元皇后了,00:06:42.560,00:06:44.800,It is probably because you look so much like Empress Première.
00:06:47.650,00:06:49.110,甄玉娆就是甄玉娆,00:06:47.650,00:06:49.412,I can only be Zhen Yurao.
00:06:49.650,00:06:51.650,只可独一无二 不能为人替身,00:06:49.650,00:06:52.329,"There can be only one of me, not two.
I can never be a substitute for someone else."
00:06:52.950,00:06:53.650,好,00:06:52.950,00:06:53.839,Good.
00:06:54.870,00:06:56.360,这才像我们甄家的女儿,00:06:54.870,00:06:56.737,That's the daughter of our Zhen family!
00:07:02.420,00:07:04.330,皇上 您该午睡了,00:07:02.420,00:07:04.632,"Your Majesty, it's time to take some rest,"
00:07:05.130,00:07:06.790,要不睡下午没精神,00:07:05.130,00:07:07.092,or you may grow tired in the afternoon.
00:07:12.590,00:07:13.000,皇上,,,
00:07:13.350,00:07:14.510,您随身佩带的鸳鸯佩呢,00:07:12.590,00:07:14.637,"Your Majesty, where is your jade pendant?"
00:07:14.800,00:07:15.540,怎么不见了,00:07:14.800,00:07:15.810,It's missing.
00:07:15.810,00:07:17.170,朕赏给玉娆了,00:07:15.810,00:07:17.170,I gave it to Yurao.
00:07:18.140,00:07:18.880,三小姐,00:07:18.140,00:07:19.140,My Third Lady?
00:07:19.140,00:07:19.880,怎么了,00:07:19.140,00:07:20.151,What's the matter?
00:07:20.980,00:07:23.310,奴才是觉得这个三小姐真有福气,00:07:20.980,00:07:23.310,"Nothing. I just think she is quite blessed,"
00:07:24.520,00:07:27.260,那个鸳鸯佩是纯元皇后的爱物啊,00:07:24.520,00:07:27.449,because that jade pendant was treasured by Empress Première.
00:07:28.650,00:07:29.890,这就叫有福气,00:07:28.650,00:07:30.192,That means she's blessed?
00:07:31.150,00:07:33.070,她有福气的日子在后头呢,00:07:31.150,00:07:33.241,Her days of blessings are yet to come.
00:07:33.950,00:07:35.310,去把安息香点上,00:07:33.950,00:07:35.536,Go light the benzoin incense.
00:07:35.740,00:07:36.320,嗻,00:07:35.740,00:07:36.320,Aye.
00:07:39.500,00:07:40.490,我听说皇上,00:07:39.500,00:07:40.824,I heard that His Majesty
00:07:41.210,00:07:43.290,以瓜尔佳文鸳大不敬为由,00:07:41.239,00:07:44.686,is investigating the Gūwalgiyas on account of Délice's offense.
00:07:43.540,00:07:44.580,问罪她母家了,,,
00:07:45.130,00:07:46.290,还牵扯出她阿玛,,,
00:07:46.540,00:07:48.000,瓜尔佳鄂敏这些年,00:07:45.130,00:07:50.120,"He uncovered her father's years of crimes
including defaming officials, colluding in fractions,"
00:07:48.250,00:07:50.120,曾经诬陷大臣 勾结党羽,,,
00:07:50.470,00:07:51.250,藏污纳贿,00:07:50.120,00:07:51.590,"taking bribes,"
00:07:51.590,00:07:54.050,行事残酷不仁这些罪呢,00:07:51.590,00:07:54.050,and exercising excessive cruelty.
00:07:54.760,00:07:55.970,这一个多月来,00:07:54.760,00:07:56.521,"In just about a month,"
00:07:56.350,00:07:58.180,抄家 落狱 流放,00:07:56.521,00:07:59.009,"their properties have been seized,
and their families imprisoned or banished."
00:07:59.520,00:08:00.880,皇上在前朝忙着,00:07:59.500,00:08:01.460,"His Majesty has been busy at court,"
00:08:01.480,00:08:02.930,咱们的耳朵也没闲着,00:08:01.460,00:08:04.160,and neither have our ears been idle.
00:08:05.190,00:08:08.350,鄂敏已经在狱中绝望自裁了,00:08:05.190,00:08:08.539,Gūwalgiya Emin has committed suicide in prison.
00:08:09.820,00:08:11.850,其实皇上何尝不知道,00:08:09.820,00:08:12.114,"Evidently, His Majesty was not unaware"
00:08:12.280,00:08:13.560,瓜尔佳氏的错漏,00:08:12.280,00:08:13.560,of their crimes.
00:08:14.660,00:08:15.940,只是朝堂之事,00:08:14.660,00:08:15.940,But with court affairs ...
00:08:16.370,00:08:17.980,往往牵一发而动全身,00:08:16.370,00:08:18.540,"""when you pull a single hair, it affects the whole body."""
00:08:18.540,00:08:19.450,不得妄动,00:08:18.540,00:08:20.410,One must not act recklessly.
00:08:20.410,00:08:23.070,如此一来 缓缓而治也是一法,00:08:20.410,00:08:23.145,"That being the case, one strategy is to delay interference."
00:08:24.120,00:08:27.460,不过我看当今圣上这几个动作,00:08:24.120,00:08:27.460,"But considering His Majesty's actions of late,"
00:08:27.750,00:08:29.330,大有断其根基之意了,00:08:27.750,00:08:30.000,he is likely intending to uproot the Gūwalgiyas.
00:08:30.420,00:08:33.040,缓缓治去何日才能见功效,00:08:30.420,00:08:33.040,Slow actions won't bring any quick results.
00:08:34.340,00:08:35.800,如果不数罪齐发,00:08:34.340,00:08:36.010,"If their crimes are not exposed all at once,"
00:08:36.010,00:08:37.920,怎能一网打尽 斩草除根,00:08:36.010,00:08:38.222,"how can they be ""caught in a single net"" and eliminated completely?"
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.420,瓜尔佳文鸳轻狂,00:08:39.060,00:08:40.890,"Délice is foolish and impertinent,"
00:08:40.890,00:08:42.260,她阿玛也好不到哪里去,00:08:40.890,00:08:42.600,and her father is no better.
00:08:43.810,00:08:45.600,皇上秉雷霆之势而下,00:08:43.810,00:08:46.204,"When His Majesty's orders came down like a thunderbolt,"
00:08:46.650,00:08:47.850,他们也措手不及,00:08:46.650,00:08:48.642,they were inevitably caught off guard.
00:08:55.950,00:08:56.940,皇后娘娘,00:08:55.950,00:08:56.940,Your Majesty.

00:09:15.840,00:09:16.960,皇后娘娘,00:09:15.840,00:09:16.960,Your Majesty!
00:09:17.590,00:09:20.510,臣妾瓜尔佳氏求见皇后娘娘,00:09:17.590,00:09:20.510,Gūwalgiya begs for an audience with Her Majesty the Empress!
00:09:20.970,00:09:22.550,皇后娘娘,00:09:20.970,00:09:22.550,Your Majesty!
00:09:24.270,00:09:24.930,站住,00:09:24.270,00:09:24.930,Stop!
00:09:29.060,00:09:29.930,瓜尔佳氏,00:09:29.060,00:09:30.195,"Of the Gūwalgiya family,"
00:09:31.940,00:09:33.680,成无男子一律斩首,00:09:31.940,00:09:33.680,"behead all the adult men,"
00:09:37.490,00:09:40.320,未满十四的流放西疆,00:09:37.490,00:09:40.320,"banish those under fourteen to the Western Front,"
00:09:41.870,00:09:44.950,妻女一律没为官奴,00:09:41.870,00:09:44.950,and confiscate all the women to be slaves of other officials.
00:09:46.750,00:09:48.240,皇上 皇上,00:09:46.750,00:09:48.240,"Your Majesty,"
00:09:48.460,00:09:50.160,求你饶恕臣妾的家人,00:09:48.460,00:09:50.160,I beg of you to pardon my family.
00:09:50.380,00:09:52.990,求你饶恕臣妾的母家 皇上,00:09:50.380,00:09:52.990,"Please spare my maiden family, Your Majesty!"
00:09:53.250,00:09:54.160,皇上,00:09:53.250,00:09:54.160,Your Majesty!
00:09:55.550,00:09:57.000,皇上,00:09:55.550,00:09:56.547,Your Majesty!
00:09:57.180,00:09:57.760,苏培盛,00:09:57.180,00:09:58.024,Su Peisheng.
00:10:00.510,00:10:01.170,奴才在,00:10:00.510,00:10:01.321,Your Majesty.
00:10:02.430,00:10:03.840,你去告诉瓜尔佳氏,00:10:02.430,00:10:03.840,Tell Gūwalgiya that
00:10:04.600,00:10:07.090,朕念她入宫侍奉多年,00:10:04.600,00:10:07.090,"considering her many years of service,"
00:10:08.770,00:10:10.760,只废她为庶人 不会赐死,00:10:08.770,00:10:10.800,"I will only demote her to a commoner.
I won't grant her suicide."
00:10:11.020,00:10:11.810,让她回去吧,00:10:11.020,00:10:11.980,Send her back.
00:10:11.980,00:10:12.520,嗻,00:10:11.980,00:10:12.520,Aye.
00:10:12.730,00:10:15.190,皇上 求你饶恕臣妾的家人吧,00:10:12.730,00:10:15.190,"Your Majesty, I beg you to pardon my family."
00:10:15.740,00:10:18.320,臣妾生不如死啊 皇上,00:10:15.740,00:10:18.640,Living like this is no better than death for me!
00:10:19.110,00:10:21.230,皇上 您偏信贱人,00:10:19.110,00:10:21.230,"Your Majesty, that bitch blinded your trust!"
00:10:21.870,00:10:24.070,冤枉对您忠心耿耿的臣子,00:10:21.870,00:10:24.372,You wrongfully convicted your loyal subjects!
00:10:24.540,00:10:26.490,甄嬛 你这个贱人,00:10:24.540,00:10:26.490,Zhen Huan! You bitch!
00:10:26.750,00:10:28.990,我就是变成厉鬼也不会饶恕你,00:10:26.750,00:10:28.990,I won't spare you even after I die!
00:10:29.250,00:10:30.790,甄嬛 你给我出来,00:10:29.250,00:10:30.790,"Come out, Zhen Huan!"
00:10:32.380,00:10:34.330,我说你们几个还干看着干吗,00:10:32.380,00:10:34.330,Why are you all standing here watching?
00:10:34.630,00:10:35.580,还不赶快处理掉,00:10:34.630,00:10:35.580,"Quick, get rid of her."
00:10:35.920,00:10:36.380,嗻 嗻,00:10:35.920,00:10:36.420,Aye. Aye.
00:10:36.550,00:10:37.290,走,00:10:36.550,00:10:37.290,Let's go.
00:10:37.880,00:10:38.920,甄嬛贱人,00:10:37.880,00:10:38.920,Zhen Huan! You bitch!
00:10:39.260,00:10:41.750,我就是做鬼也不会饶恕你的,00:10:39.260,00:10:41.750,I won't spare you even when I become a ghost!
00:10:42.180,00:10:43.630,我要变成厉鬼,00:10:42.180,00:10:43.932,I will become a ghost to haunt you!
00:11:17.420,00:11:18.880,拉去乱葬岗埋了,00:11:17.420,00:11:18.880,Bury the body in a mass grave.
00:11:19.300,00:11:20.410,别让皇上知道,,,
00:11:20.970,00:11:22.420,免得脏了皇上的耳朵,00:11:19.300,00:11:22.324,"Don't bother His Majesty with this.
It would soil His Majesty's ears."
00:11:22.590,00:11:23.050,嗻,00:11:22.590,00:11:23.165,Aye.
00:11:23.850,00:11:26.300,朕会再写一份诏书,,,
00:11:26.760,00:11:28.630,平你父亲数年之冤,00:11:23.850,00:11:30.857,"I will write another decree to exonerate your father
and reinstate his position."
00:11:29.020,00:11:30.430,让他官复原职,,,
00:11:33.190,00:11:33.890,请皇上,00:11:33.190,00:11:34.270,"Your Majesty,"
00:11:34.270,00:11:36.600,不要再给臣妾父亲过高的官职,00:11:34.270,00:11:36.980,please don't grant my father a lofty post.
00:11:36.980,00:11:38.060,他真的已经年老,00:11:36.980,00:11:38.286,He is growing old.
00:11:41.780,00:11:44.240,那朕就给他一个,00:11:41.780,00:11:47.775,"Then I'll make him the official of ceremonies at the fourth rank,"
00:11:46.120,00:11:47.650,四品典仪的闲职,,,
00:11:48.290,00:11:49.650,让他安度晚年,00:11:48.039,00:11:50.464,so he can spend his remaining years in peace.
00:11:51.210,00:11:51.950,谢皇上,00:11:51.210,00:11:52.000,I thank Your Majesty.
00:12:00.720,00:12:02.420,知道她为什么不得好死吗,00:12:00.720,00:12:02.420,Do you know why she died miserably?
00:12:03.640,00:12:04.470,臣妾不知,00:12:03.640,00:12:04.940,"I don't, Your Majesty."
00:12:05.470,00:12:06.680,她太不中用了,00:12:05.470,00:12:06.869,Because she was useless.
00:12:07.180,00:12:08.970,不中用的人留在宫里,00:12:07.180,00:12:10.760,"In the harem, an incapable woman has no way out but death."
00:12:09.180,00:12:10.760,除了死 没有其他出路,,,
00:12:12.690,00:12:14.350,宫里的女人很难对付,00:12:12.690,00:12:14.900,And the capable women can be quite difficult to deal with.
00:12:14.900,00:12:15.890,咱们更要仔细,00:12:15.060,00:12:16.349,We must be more careful.
00:12:17.230,00:12:17.810,是,00:12:17.230,00:12:17.923,Yes.
00:12:22.240,00:12:24.350,长姐为何不严审瓜尔佳文鸳,00:12:22.240,00:12:24.350,"Elder sister, why didn't you interrogate Délice"
00:12:24.860,00:12:26.320,让她说出皇后是主谋啊,00:12:24.860,00:12:26.902,and make her confess that the Empress was the mastermind?
00:12:27.660,00:12:29.400,瓜尔佳氏还有活着的人,,,
00:12:29.990,00:12:31.950,她不会连累那些人一同死去,00:12:27.580,00:12:32.160,"She would be too fearful that the Empress would then
 execute all survivors of the Gūwalgiya clan."
00:12:32.710,00:12:33.820,而且她’―艮我入骨,00:12:32.721,00:12:34.541,And she hated me to the core.
00:12:34.830,00:12:37.410,怎会希望失去能克制我的人呢,00:12:34.805,00:12:37.894,"Why would she have wanted to implicate
the only woman who can constrain me?"
00:12:38.210,00:12:39.750,多年来 王爷搜集了不少,00:12:38.210,00:12:40.880,"Over the years, His Lordship collected proof of
many instances of the Gūwalgiyas' crimes."
00:12:40.050,00:12:40.910,瓜尔佳氏的罪证,,,
00:12:41.340,00:12:43.050,终于今日有用武之地了,00:12:41.340,00:12:43.314,Now we finally had the chance to use it.
00:12:44.090,00:12:45.380,十七爷是你的夫君,00:12:44.090,00:12:45.757,Lord XVII is your husband.
00:12:46.010,00:12:47.920,为岳丈一家尽力也是应该的,00:12:46.236,00:12:48.426,It's only natural that he helps his in-laws.
00:12:49.060,00:12:50.890,以后你在宫外来往方便,00:12:49.060,00:12:51.003,"Since you live outside of the palace,"
00:12:51.390,00:12:53.630,家中就需你与王爷多多照顾,00:12:51.390,00:12:53.630,I hope you and His Lordship can look after our family.
00:12:53.980,00:12:55.760,那是自然 长姐放心,00:12:53.980,00:12:55.760,"Rest assured, elder sister."
00:12:56.850,00:12:58.090,王爷肯如此尽心,,,
00:12:59.190,00:12:59.900,终究也是因为,00:12:56.850,00:13:01.800,"His Lordship devoted himself to helping us
because you show dedication to his estate."
00:13:00.230,00:13:01.520,你在王府得力的缘故,,,
00:13:03.190,00:13:05.150,孟静娴还好相处吧,00:13:03.190,00:13:05.452,Are you getting along with Meng Jingxian?
00:13:06.410,00:13:07.490,可给你委屈受,00:13:06.410,00:13:07.840,Has she given you a hard time?
00:13:09.700,00:13:11.570,她哪能给我什么委屈受啊,00:13:10.000,00:13:11.870,How could she?
00:13:12.410,00:13:14.400,她近来身子虽然好了不少,00:13:12.410,00:13:14.400,"Although her health is improving,"
00:13:14.910,00:13:16.650,但终日也是参汤不离口,00:13:14.910,00:13:16.989,she still has to drink ginseng soup daily.
00:13:17.880,00:13:19.790,素日王爷总是怜悯她,00:13:18.069,00:13:21.509,"His Lordship shows pity towards her, so she is well provided for."
00:13:20.170,00:13:21.160,倒也衣食无缺,,,
00:13:22.260,00:13:24.750,只是平日也说不上什么话,00:13:22.260,00:13:25.014,But they have little to talk about.
00:13:28.010,00:13:29.630,王爷待她原没什么情分,00:13:28.010,00:13:30.000,His Lordship has no affection towards her
00:13:30.430,00:13:32.800,不比你与王爷相识多年,00:13:30.430,00:13:32.800,while you have known His Lordship for years.
00:13:33.020,00:13:34.180,长姐惯会取笑我,00:13:33.020,00:13:34.708,You always make fun of me.
00:13:36.730,00:13:39.850,不过王爷的确是待我挺好的,00:13:36.730,00:13:39.850,But you are right. His Lordship treats me well.
00:13:40.860,00:13:42.940,长姐 我要出去一下,00:13:40.860,00:13:43.242,"Elder sister, I'm going to go out."
00:13:44.900,00:13:46.310,三妹打扮得这么漂亮,00:13:44.900,00:13:46.860,Our third sister is so beautifully dressed.
00:13:46.860,00:13:47.820,这是要上哪儿去啊,00:13:46.860,00:13:47.820,Where is she going?
00:13:48.530,00:13:50.150,我也不知道她要去哪儿,00:13:48.530,00:13:50.150,I have no idea.
00:13:50.490,00:13:52.700,女大心思多 竟也看不住她,00:13:50.490,00:13:52.700,It's not easy to keep a grown girl at home.
00:13:53.200,00:13:54.820,昨日听王爷说了才知道,00:13:53.200,00:13:54.820,Yesterday I heard from His Lordship that
00:13:55.710,00:13:57.910,慎贝勒入宫向太后请安,00:13:55.710,00:13:59.880,"Venerable Prince Shen ran into Yurao
when he came to visit the Empress Dowager."
00:13:58.540,00:13:59.870,结果撞上了我们三妹,,,
00:14:00.540,00:14:03.160,不知怎么的 两个人都脸红了起来,00:14:00.540,00:14:03.160,"And for whatever reason,
both of them blushed upon seeing each other."
00:14:03.800,00:14:05.080,太后还觉得奇怪呢,00:14:03.800,00:14:05.612,The Empress Dowager was also surprised.
00:14:05.970,00:14:07.000,是什么时候的事,00:14:05.970,00:14:07.528,Since when has this been going on?
00:14:08.220,00:14:09.800,姐姐说什么呢,00:14:08.220,00:14:09.800,What do you mean?
00:14:10.680,00:14:13.260,慎贝勒是什么时候开始的事,00:14:10.680,00:14:13.260,I'm asking about you and Venerable Prince Shen.
00:14:14.390,00:14:15.180,大约,00:14:14.390,00:14:15.180,About...
00:14:16.390,00:14:17.380,我也不记得了,00:14:16.390,00:14:17.380,I don't remember.
00:14:19.190,00:14:20.970,你不介意他母亲出身寒微吗,00:14:19.190,00:14:21.313,Don't you mind his mother's humble background?
00:14:21.520,00:14:22.930,他也从未嫌弃过我啊,00:14:21.520,00:14:23.000,He never considered my background.
00:14:25.230,00:14:27.150,我还记得曾有人说过,00:14:25.230,00:14:27.559,I remember someone once said that
00:14:27.950,00:14:30.150,我宁愿嫁与匹夫草草一生,00:14:27.899,00:14:32.560,"""I'd rather live a coarse life with a commoner
than marry into any imperial palace or estate."""
00:14:30.450,00:14:32.560,也断不入宫门王府半步,,,
00:14:32.990,00:14:34.650,也不知这话是谁说的,00:14:32.990,00:14:34.650,I wonder who said that?
00:14:36.250,00:14:37.450,姐姐别笑我,00:14:36.250,00:14:37.760,"Stop teasing me, elder sister."
00:14:37.910,00:14:39.910,允禧他和皇上不一样,00:14:37.910,00:14:40.226,Yunxi is different from His Majesty.
00:14:40.710,00:14:42.370,他很好,00:14:40.710,00:14:42.370,He is nice.
00:14:43.960,00:14:45.170,若你们真有此意,00:14:43.960,00:14:45.547,"If you two are serious,"
00:14:45.960,00:14:47.580,我也可去问问皇上的意思,00:14:45.960,00:14:49.360,I can ask about His Majesty's opinion.
00:14:48.220,00:14:49.380,请他为你们指婚,,,
00:14:50.510,00:14:51.220,只是一样,,,
00:14:51.680,00:14:53.540,不许你偷偷跑出去和他见面,00:14:50.510,00:14:53.600,But promise me that you won't meet with him in secret.
00:14:54.390,00:14:55.850,免得被人知道了笑话,00:14:54.390,00:14:55.850,People will gossip and laugh.
00:14:56.220,00:14:56.800,好,00:14:56.220,00:14:57.064,All right.
00:14:57.560,00:14:58.640,玉隐姐姐 我走了,00:14:57.560,00:14:58.829,"Yuyin, I take my leave now."
00:15:03.310,00:15:04.650,长姐下定决心了吗,00:15:03.310,00:15:05.178,"Have you made up your mind, elder sister?"
00:15:06.070,00:15:07.600,皇上对玉娆的意思,00:15:06.070,00:15:09.000,We both can see His Majesty is interested in Yurao.
00:15:07.900,00:15:09.020,你我不是看不出来,,,
00:15:10.280,00:15:11.770,趁着现在事情还好办,00:15:10.280,00:15:13.800,We may as well marry Yurao off before things get difficult.
00:15:12.410,00:15:13.820,把玉娆嫁出去也好,,,
00:15:14.780,00:15:15.740,我思来想去,00:15:14.780,00:15:16.220,I've considered that
00:15:16.740,00:15:18.740,若是嫁给寻常人家总是无用,00:15:16.673,00:15:19.432,it won't be helpful if Yurao marries into an ordinary family.
00:15:19.620,00:15:21.360,也只有嫁给皇上的亲兄弟,00:15:19.620,00:15:23.400,"But if Yurao is married to one of his own brothers,
it will end His Majesty's hopes."
00:15:21.790,00:15:23.410,才能彻底断了皇上的念头,,,
00:15:24.000,00:15:26.210,否则终究是后患无穷,00:15:24.000,00:15:26.210,"Otherwise, we will have endless trouble."
00:15:27.130,00:15:27.920,这样也好,00:15:27.130,00:15:28.264,It's just as well.
00:15:28.710,00:15:30.170,幸好三妹和慎贝勒爷,00:15:28.710,00:15:31.320,"Fortunately, Yurao and Lord Shen are attached to each other,"
00:15:30.470,00:15:31.330,都是两情相悦,,,
00:15:31.680,00:15:32.880,倒也省了不少麻烦呢,00:15:31.680,00:15:33.106,which makes things much easier.
00:15:34.680,00:15:36.920,只是如今宫中嫔妃不多,00:15:34.680,00:15:37.691,"It's just that there are only a few concubines in the harem now,"
00:15:37.720,00:15:39.960,皇上的眼睛总是盯在玉娆身上,00:15:37.880,00:15:40.322,so His Majesty's eyes are fixed on Yurao.
00:15:40.850,00:15:43.840,得想个法子撇开皇上的心思才好,00:15:40.850,00:15:44.881,We need to find a way to divert His Majesty's attention.
00:15:47.530,00:15:48.730,长姐若是放心,,,
00:15:49.360,00:15:51.270,不如就将此事交给我来办吧,00:15:47.530,00:15:51.240,"Elder sister, you may entrust this to me."
00:15:53.740,00:15:56.860,采苹 你跟着王爷多少年了,00:15:53.740,00:15:56.860,"Lotus, for how long have you served His Lordship?"
00:15:57.540,00:15:58.370,五六年了,00:15:57.540,00:15:58.785,Five or six years.
00:15:59.450,00:16:00.410,王爷对你好吗,00:15:59.450,00:16:00.787,Has His Lord treated you well?
00:16:01.160,00:16:02.650,王爷对奴婢恩重如山,00:16:01.135,00:16:03.632,"His Lordship has bestowed upon me
 ""kindness as weighty as a mountain."""
00:16:04.580,00:16:07.000,那咱们王爷在宫里的处境,00:16:04.580,00:16:08.480,And do you know about His Lordship's situation in the palace?
00:16:07.750,00:16:08.490,你可知道,,,
00:16:10.340,00:16:11.950,咱们皇上的手足不少,00:16:10.340,00:16:12.343,"His Majesty has many brothers,"
00:16:13.050,00:16:14.710,但是放在眼里的却没几个,00:16:13.050,00:16:15.163,but only few of them are treated with deference.
00:16:15.760,00:16:18.000,削爵的削爵 圈禁的圈禁,00:16:15.760,00:16:18.400,"Some were stripped of their titles, and some were imprisoned."
00:16:18.640,00:16:20.300,不知道哪天就遭了祸了,00:16:18.640,00:16:20.480,A disaster could overwhelm any of them at any time.
00:16:21.310,00:16:22.140,咱们皇上,,,
00:16:23.190,00:16:25.140,可是连亲兄弟都没有放过的,00:16:21.310,00:16:25.120,His Majesty hasn't shown mercy even to his own brothers.
00:16:28.320,00:16:29.230,侧福晋,00:16:28.320,00:16:29.400,Your Ladyship...
00:16:33.200,00:16:33.860,来,00:16:33.200,00:16:33.860,Come here.
00:16:37.410,00:16:38.650,咱们在宫外头的,,,
00:16:39.200,00:16:40.740,不知道皇上的喜怒哀乐,00:16:37.410,00:16:40.800,"Because we are outside the palace
we don't know His Majesty's inclinations."
00:16:41.830,00:16:42.860,可是如果皇上,,,
00:16:43.160,00:16:44.620,身边多了一个贴心的人,00:16:41.830,00:16:45.105,But what if someone from our estate
00:16:45.540,00:16:46.950,是咱们府里出去的,00:16:45.558,00:16:47.643,were close to His Majesty's heart
00:16:48.000,00:16:49.290,平日里好言好语地,,,
00:16:49.550,00:16:50.660,在皇上面前哄着,00:16:48.171,00:16:52.159,and could please him with honeyed words?
00:16:51.010,00:16:51.920,让皇上高兴,,,
00:16:52.800,00:16:56.040,那咱们府不也就多了一重保障吗,00:16:52.800,00:16:56.040,"Then our estate would be better protected, wouldn't it?"
00:16:57.850,00:16:59.180,侧福晋的意思,00:16:57.850,00:16:59.749,Your Ladyship is suggesting that ...
00:17:00.350,00:17:01.880,奴婢担不起这样的大任,00:17:00.350,00:17:02.144,I could shoulder such a great task.
00:17:02.980,00:17:03.930,你担得起,00:17:02.980,00:17:03.930,You can.
00:17:04.730,00:17:07.340,咱们王府 再算上清凉台,00:17:04.730,00:17:09.400,You are the fairest in His Lordship's estate and the Cooling Terrace.
00:17:08.150,00:17:09.430,你可是拔尖的美人,,,
00:17:10.190,00:17:13.400,再加上你对王爷又忠心耿耿,00:17:10.190,00:17:13.400,"Moreover, you are loyal to His Lordship."
00:17:14.360,00:17:16.820,除了你 我放心不下别人,00:17:14.360,00:17:17.181,I can't entrust this to anyone but you.
00:17:17.700,00:17:18.310,奴婢,00:17:17.700,00:17:18.310,I ...
00:17:18.530,00:17:20.320,要是你还记得王爷对你的恩德,00:17:18.530,00:17:20.640,"If you are truly grateful for His Lordship's kindness,"
00:17:21.160,00:17:22.320,你就应该为我们王府,,,
00:17:22.620,00:17:23.480,好好考虑一下,00:17:21.160,00:17:23.881,you should act in the interests of the whole estate.
00:17:26.960,00:17:27.740,放心吧,00:17:26.960,00:17:27.740,"Trust me,"
00:17:28.960,00:17:29.820,你的模样,,,
00:17:30.920,00:17:32.410,皇上见了肯定喜欢,00:17:28.960,00:17:32.400,His Majesty will appreciate how beautiful you are.
00:17:33.710,00:17:34.370,奴婢,00:17:33.710,00:17:34.370,I ...
00:17:37.130,00:17:38.500,但凭侧福晋盼咐,00:17:37.130,00:17:39.021,I will follow Your Ladyship's orders.
00:17:43.430,00:17:45.010,贵妃娘娘还不知道吧,,,
00:17:45.770,00:17:47.630,有人告发了安嫔的父亲,00:17:43.430,00:17:47.600,"Your Noble Highness might not have heard
the news about Concubine An's father."
00:17:47.900,00:17:49.640,搜刮了八十余万两银子,00:17:47.900,00:17:50.800,"He was reported for taking bribes of
 eight hundred thousand taels and several estates."
00:17:49.900,00:17:50.810,及几处宅子,,,
00:17:51.320,00:17:54.310,这回皇上可是生了大气了,00:17:51.320,00:17:54.310,"This time, His Majesty is outraged."
00:17:56.610,00:17:58.850,贵人不告诉我 我还不知道呢,00:17:56.610,00:17:59.114,Really? You telling me is the first I've heard of it.
00:17:59.700,00:18:02.740,现在宫里谁不把这事当成笑话说,00:17:59.700,00:18:02.740,"Yes, everyone in the harem is laughing about it."
00:18:03.950,00:18:07.370,贵妃只看这只鸟毛色雪不雪白,00:18:03.950,00:18:07.521,"In Your Noble Highness's eyes,
this bird is appreciated for its snow-white feathers."
00:18:08.040,00:18:10.500,但是不知道落在安比槐的眼里呀,,,
00:18:10.840,00:18:13.450,这只鸟会不会是银子打的呀,00:18:08.040,00:18:13.480,"But in An Bihuai's eyes, each feather would have to be
a silver tael to be beautiful!"
00:18:15.050,00:18:16.460,贵人惯会笑话的,00:18:15.050,00:18:16.460,"Joie, you're never short on wit."
00:18:17.090,00:18:19.500,三年清知县 十万雪花银,00:18:17.090,00:18:20.140," ""In three years, even an honest village magistrate
 amasses bribes of a hundred thousand taels."""
00:18:20.140,00:18:21.500,何况安比槐是国丈,00:18:20.160,00:18:23.022,"And An Bihuai is ""the nation's father-in-law."""
00:18:21.800,00:18:22.880,是皇上的老丈人,,,
00:18:23.260,00:18:24.930,八十万两白银算什么呀,00:18:23.040,00:18:25.220,Eight hundred thousand taels are nothing to him.
00:18:25.220,00:18:26.890,他那国丈也是他自己封的,00:18:25.240,00:18:28.071,"An Bihuai honored himself as
""the nation's father-in-law"" to fool the dolts."
00:18:27.140,00:18:27.930,哄傻子罢了,,,
00:18:28.730,00:18:30.720,皇上可没有把他当成国丈,00:18:28.730,00:18:30.909,His Majesty doesn't consider him as the father-in-law.
00:18:31.270,00:18:33.350,照样废了官职 关押起来,00:18:31.270,00:18:33.539,He is now deposed and detained.
00:18:34.360,00:18:35.810,女儿得宠最要紧,00:18:34.360,00:18:36.225,"As long as his daughter is in favor,"
00:18:36.070,00:18:38.100,谁管他是真国丈还是假国丈呢,00:18:36.225,00:18:38.560,"no one would care about whether
he was truly ""the nation's father-in-law."""
00:18:39.200,00:18:40.310,还是贵人聪明,00:18:39.200,00:18:40.740,It was clever of you
00:18:40.740,00:18:42.150,让你阿玛在暗中留意,00:18:40.740,00:18:42.450,to have your father keep an eye on him
00:18:42.450,00:18:44.160,才抓住了安比槐的痛处,00:18:42.450,00:18:44.160,and expose his weaknesses.
00:18:44.540,00:18:46.450,否则安嫔也太得意了,00:18:44.540,00:18:46.639,"Otherwise, Concubine An would grow too proud."
00:18:46.790,00:18:48.240,要不是娘娘有筹谋,00:18:46.790,00:18:48.769,"Were it not for Your Highness's far-sighted plan,"
00:18:48.580,00:18:50.910,嫔妾就是抓住了安比槐的把柄,00:18:48.769,00:18:51.880,I wouldn't have had a use for this leverage.
00:18:51.170,00:18:51.910,也没有用,,,
00:18:52.340,00:18:54.790,皇上正在为瓜尔佳氏一族生气呢,00:18:52.340,00:18:54.960,His Majesty is furious with the Gūwalgiya clan right now.
00:18:55.090,00:18:56.500,谁让他一头撞进来啊,00:18:55.090,00:18:57.050,Why did An Bihuai have to barrel into this mess?
00:18:57.050,00:18:59.000,再说 他那知府,00:18:57.050,00:18:59.409,"Besides, His Majesty only promoted him to Mayor"
00:18:59.220,00:19:02.080,又是皇上看在安嫔的面子上才封的,00:18:59.409,00:19:02.080,on account of Concubine An's favor.
00:19:02.760,00:19:04.630,这不是打了皇上的耳光,00:19:02.760,00:19:04.630,Isn't that a slap to His Majesty's face?
00:19:04.970,00:19:06.050,叫人看笑话吗,00:19:04.857,00:19:06.391,He made himself a laughing stock.
00:19:07.270,00:19:10.850,听说安嫔跪在养心殿外脱簪待罪,00:19:07.270,00:19:11.021,"I heard that Concubine An has been pleading with unfastened hair,
kneeling outside the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:19:11.310,00:19:12.720,已经哭了两天了,00:19:11.021,00:19:13.161,She's been crying for the past two days.
00:19:19.570,00:19:20.560,给娘娘请安,00:19:19.570,00:19:20.824,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:19:21.200,00:19:21.860,苏公公,00:19:21.200,00:19:22.011,Mr. Su.
00:19:22.700,00:19:23.480,皇上传旨,,,
00:19:23.700,00:19:26.360,想和娘娘一块在养心殿用晚誊,00:19:22.700,00:19:26.549,"His Majesty summons Your Highness to have dinner
with him later in the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:19:26.990,00:19:27.730,娘娘请吧,00:19:26.990,00:19:27.919,"Your Highness, please."
00:19:28.540,00:19:29.400,知道了,00:19:28.540,00:19:29.400,Understood.
00:19:30.790,00:19:32.160,那嫔妾就不打扰了,00:19:30.790,00:19:32.756,I won't bother Your Highness any longer.
00:19:32.460,00:19:33.370,先告辞了,00:19:32.756,00:19:33.718,I take my leave.

00:19:52.770,00:19:54.100,安妹妹何苦这样,00:19:52.770,00:19:54.727,"Lingrong, why do you have to do this to yourself?"
00:19:55.560,00:19:57.100,还是自己的身子要紧,00:19:55.560,00:19:57.614,You should be mindful about your health.
00:19:59.150,00:20:01.140,姐姐不会连脱簪请罪的机会,00:19:59.150,00:20:02.200,"Would you deny me the right
to ""plead with unfastened hair""?"
00:20:01.450,00:20:02.230,也不给我吧,,,
00:20:02.490,00:20:03.190,怎么会,00:20:02.490,00:20:03.605,It's not that.
00:20:04.870,00:20:06.980,我只是担心夜深风露重,00:20:04.870,00:20:07.244,I'm just worried that it'll be windy and humid during the late night.
00:20:07.740,00:20:09.030,万一冻坏了妹妹,00:20:07.740,00:20:09.181,"What if you catch a cold,"
00:20:10.250,00:20:11.080,要不然,00:20:10.250,00:20:11.080,or
00:20:12.250,00:20:15.040,从哪里跑出一只老鼠皎了妹妹,00:20:12.250,00:20:15.040,"a rat scurries out and bites you,"
00:20:15.790,00:20:17.200,得了疫症可怎么好,00:20:15.790,00:20:17.641,giving you the plague?
00:20:19.210,00:20:20.250,姐姐说笑了,00:20:19.210,00:20:20.250,I know you're joking.
00:20:21.260,00:20:23.500,养心殿何来老鼠,00:20:21.260,00:20:24.061,How can there be rats near the Hall of Mental Cultivation?
00:20:25.140,00:20:27.750,是 我忘了,00:20:25.140,00:20:26.289,"Yes,"
,,,00:20:26.930,00:20:28.391,I forgot.
00:20:29.600,00:20:31.300,牢狱里才会有这些,00:20:29.600,00:20:31.526,You would only find such creatures in a prison.
00:20:32.520,00:20:33.880,是我担心错了,00:20:32.520,00:20:34.492,My concern was mistaken.
00:20:35.400,00:20:37.060,我不该担心安妹妹,00:20:35.400,00:20:37.173,"I shouldn't have worried about you,"
00:20:38.270,00:20:39.480,而该担心,00:20:38.270,00:20:39.480,"but rather,"
00:20:41.360,00:20:42.570,安伯父,00:20:41.360,00:20:43.131,worried for your father.
00:20:55.880,00:20:56.860,娘娘吉祥,00:20:55.880,00:20:57.049,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:20:58.090,00:20:59.370,皇上万福金安,00:20:58.090,00:20:59.596,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:21:00.250,00:21:01.840,朕等了你好一会儿了,00:21:00.250,00:21:01.991,I've been waiting for you for a while.
00:21:06.760,00:21:08.720,看见安妹妹在外头跪着可怜,00:21:06.760,00:21:08.946,"I saw Lingrong kneeling outside, very pitifully."
00:21:09.100,00:21:10.300,臣妾劝了她几句,00:21:09.100,00:21:10.640,I tried to talk her out of it.
00:21:10.810,00:21:11.840,她怎么会听呢,00:21:10.810,00:21:11.840,How could she listen?
00:21:12.600,00:21:13.510,此刻她心里,,,
00:21:13.770,00:21:15.300,只有她那个不成器的父亲,00:21:12.600,00:21:15.280,"Right now, she's only thinking about her decadent father."
00:21:16.190,00:21:17.270,朕许他知府,,,
00:21:18.150,00:21:19.430,给他升官的恩惠,00:21:16.190,00:21:19.400,I granted him the promotion to Mayor.
00:21:20.520,00:21:22.980,他竟这般糟蹋 丢朕的脸,00:21:20.520,00:21:23.320,How dare he squander my favor and make me lose face!
00:21:23.780,00:21:24.860,皇上别生气,00:21:23.780,00:21:25.275,"Your Majesty, don't be angry."
00:21:25.860,00:21:27.950,安比槐再不好也是安比槐的事,00:21:25.860,00:21:28.101,"An Bihuai's wrongdoing is his own,"
00:21:28.450,00:21:29.730,跟安妹妹有什么干系,00:21:28.400,00:21:30.226,it has nothing to do with Concubine An.
00:21:30.410,00:21:31.620,皇上就让她起来吧,00:21:30.410,00:21:31.809,Would Your Majesty let her rise?
00:21:32.830,00:21:34.740,朕何尝想责罚她呢,00:21:32.830,00:21:34.740,I never wanted to punish her.
00:21:35.620,00:21:38.740,是她自己要跪在那儿替父代罪,00:21:35.620,00:21:38.740,"She chose to kneel and plead for her father,"
00:21:39.250,00:21:39.960,不成体统,00:21:39.250,00:21:40.514,which is most improper.
00:21:41.170,00:21:42.660,安妹妹也是救父心切,00:21:41.170,00:21:43.151,Concubine An is desperate to save her father.
00:21:43.340,00:21:44.550,皇上不要怪罪她,00:21:43.340,00:21:44.927,"Your Majesty, don't blame it on her, please."
00:21:46.930,00:21:48.420,皇上会宽恕安比槐吗,00:21:46.930,00:21:48.680,Will Your Majesty spare An Bihuai?
00:21:48.680,00:21:49.380,怎么会呢,00:21:48.680,00:21:49.644,Why would I?
00:21:50.970,00:21:52.960,朕既不会迁怒于她,00:21:50.970,00:21:53.120,"I will neither take my anger out on her,"
00:21:53.850,00:21:56.680,也不会因为她而宽恕安比槐,00:21:53.850,00:21:56.680,nor spare An Bihuai for her sake.
00:21:57.600,00:22:00.350,安妹妹水米不进两日了,00:21:57.600,00:22:00.350,"She hasn't been eating or drinking for two days,"
00:22:01.270,00:22:02.350,且不眠不休,00:22:01.270,00:22:02.576,nor has she slept.
00:22:03.530,00:22:04.810,皇上也不怕她有事,00:22:03.530,00:22:05.080,Is Your Majesty not worried about her?
00:22:05.190,00:22:06.680,嫔妃自戕是大罪,00:22:05.190,00:22:06.906,"Committing suicide is a serious crime for a concubine,"
00:22:07.320,00:22:08.440,会连累家人,00:22:07.320,00:22:08.968,which would implicate her family.
00:22:09.200,00:22:10.280,她不敢,00:22:09.200,00:22:10.506,She would not dare.
00:22:18.960,00:22:19.660,皇上,00:22:18.960,00:22:19.849,Your Majesty.
00:22:20.670,00:22:22.120,安妹妹淡妆素里,00:22:20.670,00:22:22.732,"Dressed in white with her makeup removed,"
00:22:22.960,00:22:24.870,比平日里更招人怜爱了,00:22:22.960,00:22:25.134,Concubine An is even more entrancing than usual.
00:22:26.470,00:22:27.450,只可惜,00:22:26.470,00:22:27.714,But what a shame...
00:22:28.340,00:22:28.960,什么,00:22:28.340,00:22:29.224,Why?
00:22:31.100,00:22:34.130,这纯与白原是最干净的,00:22:31.100,00:22:34.130,"White is clean, and the purest color."
00:22:35.310,00:22:37.260,不该与欲望纠缠在一起,00:22:35.310,00:22:38.261,It should not be woven with one's desire.
00:22:38.640,00:22:39.880,和欲望在一起,00:22:38.525,00:22:40.480,"Twisted with desire,"
00:22:40.730,00:22:42.390,玷污了纯白的本意,00:22:40.730,00:22:43.040,the inherent purity of whiteness is tarnished.
00:22:44.780,00:22:47.390,夜凉了 送安嫔回去吧,00:22:44.780,00:22:47.390,The night is getting cold. Send Concubine An back.
00:22:47.950,00:22:48.600,皇上,00:22:47.950,00:22:48.860,Your Majesty!
00:22:48.860,00:22:50.570,朕会囚禁安比槐,00:22:48.860,00:22:50.570,I will keep An Bihuai imprisoned.
00:22:51.570,00:22:52.530,你再求朕,00:22:51.570,00:22:52.832,"If you plead any more,"
00:22:53.280,00:22:54.570,朕一定会杀了他,00:22:53.280,00:22:54.721,I will have him executed.
00:22:56.040,00:22:56.740,皇上,00:22:56.040,00:22:56.960,Your Majesty...
00:22:59.580,00:23:00.320,皇上,00:22:59.580,00:23:00.320,Your Majesty!
00:23:01.830,00:23:02.490,皇上,00:23:01.720,00:23:02.720,Your Majesty!
00:23:11.260,00:23:12.050,皇上,,,
00:23:15.510,00:23:16.380,皇上,,,
00:23:21.690,00:23:25.050,臣妾恳求皇后娘娘救救臣妾父亲,00:23:21.690,00:23:25.050,I beg of Your Majesty to save my father.
00:23:27.110,00:23:30.070,本宫只怕是有心也无力呀,00:23:27.110,00:23:30.070,"I'm afraid that despite my inclination to help you, I am powerless."
00:23:31.780,00:23:34.110,只要娘娘愿意施以援手,00:23:31.780,00:23:34.110,"If Your Majesty would only lend me a helping hand,"
00:23:34.830,00:23:37.690,臣妾愿为娘娘肝脑涂地,00:23:34.830,00:23:37.690,I would die for Your Majesty a thousand times with no regrets.
00:23:38.290,00:23:39.450,娘娘 娘娘,00:23:38.290,00:23:39.450,Your Majesty!
00:23:39.750,00:23:41.280,不是本宫不想帮你,00:23:39.750,00:23:41.393,It is not that I don't want to help you.
00:23:42.170,00:23:45.660,只怕这次你只有自己帮自己了,00:23:42.170,00:23:45.660,"I'm afraid that, this time, you must rely on yourself."
00:23:46.340,00:23:48.250,还望娘娘指点迷津,00:23:46.491,00:23:48.401,I beg Your Majesty to enlighten me about the right path.
00:23:51.130,00:23:53.590,皇上仁厚 重视子嗣,00:23:51.545,00:23:54.208,His Majesty is benevolent and places great importance on his children.
00:23:54.510,00:23:57.130,你服侍皇上多年从未怀孕,00:23:54.510,00:23:57.281,"You've been serving His Majesty for years
but have never been pregnant."
00:23:59.770,00:24:03.130,本宫这里有一个秘方 灵验无比,00:23:59.770,00:24:03.130,"I have a secret prescription which is extraordinarily effective,"
00:24:03.900,00:24:05.140,但药性凶猛,00:24:03.900,00:24:06.233,but the herbal dosages can be harsh on your health.
00:24:06.770,00:24:10.390,你若有了龙胎 重得圣上的怜爱,00:24:06.770,00:24:10.390,You will regain His Majesty's deep favor if you are pregnant.
00:24:10.950,00:24:12.810,自然也会爱屋及乌,00:24:10.950,00:24:13.196,"Naturally, the favor will extend to your family."
00:24:13.530,00:24:14.140,可是,00:24:13.530,00:24:14.404,But...
00:24:15.070,00:24:17.070,可是臣妾服食息肌丸,00:24:15.070,00:24:17.070,but I was taking the Flesh Thinning Pills.
00:24:17.700,00:24:20.530,只怕即使真的怀上龙胎,00:24:17.700,00:24:20.530,"Even if I could become pregnant,"
00:24:21.000,00:24:22.950,也不能真的生养啊 娘娘,00:24:21.000,00:24:22.950,"I may not be able to deliver the child, Your Majesty."
00:24:23.330,00:24:25.820,既然你怀孕便可解燃眉之急,00:24:23.330,00:24:25.820,"If pregnancy itself is enough to resolve this desperate issue,"
00:24:26.170,00:24:27.950,又哪里需要真的生养呢,00:24:26.170,00:24:28.464,it's not necessary that you actually deliver the child.
00:24:36.050,00:24:36.880,我听玉隐说,00:24:36.050,00:24:36.880,I heard from Yuyin that
00:24:37.510,00:24:38.630,皇上对玉娆有意,00:24:37.510,00:24:38.630, His Majesty is interested in Yurao.
00:24:39.720,00:24:40.960,若是熹贵妃求情,00:24:39.720,00:24:41.240,"If Noble Consort Lumière intercedes on your behalf,"
00:24:41.310,00:24:42.390,皇上肯赐婚就好,00:24:41.310,00:24:42.524,I hope His Majesty will grant you two marriage.
00:24:44.560,00:24:45.270,若是不肯,00:24:44.560,00:24:45.827,But what will you do
00:24:46.650,00:24:47.390,你打算怎么办,00:24:46.650,00:24:47.733,if His Majesty disapproves?
00:24:50.190,00:24:51.520,我是个最不起眼的贝勒,00:24:50.151,00:24:52.292,"I'm just a Venerable Prince, almost invisible."
00:24:52.610,00:24:53.350,我什么都不要,00:24:52.610,00:24:54.280,I yearn for nothing in this world
00:24:54.280,00:24:55.020,就只要玉娆,00:24:54.280,00:24:55.406, but Yurao.
00:24:57.030,00:24:57.940,可是你得知道,00:24:57.030,00:24:58.326,Yet you need to realize that
00:24:59.080,00:25:01.910,咱们怎么争也争不过皇上,00:24:59.080,00:25:01.910, we can never contend with His Majesty.
00:25:03.460,00:25:04.540,皇上能争得去人,00:25:03.460,00:25:05.330,"His Majesty can take any lady he wants,"
00:25:05.330,00:25:06.450,难道他能争得去心吗,00:25:05.330,00:25:07.007,but not their hearts.
00:25:07.920,00:25:08.870,即便不能成功,00:25:07.920,00:25:09.470,"Even if I might not succeed,"
00:25:10.130,00:25:11.080,我也要奋力一搏,00:25:10.130,00:25:11.594,I will spare no effort.
00:25:13.670,00:25:15.160,我曾经失去过心爱的人,00:25:13.670,00:25:15.760,"I lost the woman I loved before,"
00:25:16.140,00:25:17.500,所以明白你现在的心思,00:25:16.140,00:25:18.443,so I understand your feelings now.
00:25:19.850,00:25:20.840,我只问你一句话,00:25:19.850,00:25:21.526,I only need to ask you one thing.
00:25:22.270,00:25:23.720,你对玉娆是否真心,00:25:22.270,00:25:23.753,Do you love Yurao wholeheartedly?
00:25:26.560,00:25:27.390,我心匪石,00:25:26.560,00:25:28.419,"""My heart is not a round pebble."""
00:25:28.810,00:25:29.520,不可转也,00:25:28.810,00:25:30.335," ""It cannot turn and change course."""
00:25:31.360,00:25:32.970,我早知道他这番心意,00:25:31.360,00:25:33.699,I've known about his feelings early on.
00:25:34.900,00:25:36.640,有他对玉娆如此心意,00:25:34.900,00:25:38.640,"Given his sincerity, it's worth pushing past some setbacks."
00:25:37.070,00:25:38.480,费些周折也是值得的,,,
00:25:39.780,00:25:40.570,你放心,00:25:39.780,00:25:40.947,I assure you that
00:25:41.240,00:25:44.080,这件事我们虽然没有十足的把握,00:25:41.240,00:25:44.349,we will do anything we can
00:25:44.500,00:25:45.700,但都要尽力一试,00:25:44.500,00:25:46.370,though not everything is within our control.
00:25:46.370,00:25:47.990,不叫你和慎贝勒抱憾终身,00:25:46.370,00:25:48.967,"We don't want you two
to live with regret for the rest of your lives."
00:25:49.500,00:25:50.990,如今太后命悬一线,00:25:49.437,00:25:51.627,The Empress Dowager's health is precarious now.
00:25:51.670,00:25:53.250,这件事情一定要趁早办,00:25:51.816,00:25:53.996,We need to make haste.
00:25:54.590,00:25:56.080,免得太后一旦崩逝,00:25:54.590,00:25:56.306,"If Her Majesty were to pass away suddenly,"
00:25:56.470,00:25:57.960,你们还要守三年国丧,00:25:56.470,00:25:58.340,we would enter three years of national mourning.
00:25:58.340,00:25:59.170,夜长梦多,00:25:58.340,00:26:00.171,"""One has more dreams the longer he sleeps."""
00:26:00.970,00:26:02.630,上次长姐托付我的事,00:26:00.970,00:26:02.890,"Elder sister, regarding what you asked me to do,"
00:26:02.890,00:26:03.750,我已经办好了,00:26:02.890,00:26:04.354,I've arranged everything.
00:26:04.560,00:26:05.920,午后新人就会入宫,00:26:04.560,00:26:06.297,The new concubine will enter the palace this afternoon.
00:26:06.640,00:26:07.430,是什么人,00:26:06.640,00:26:07.732,Who is she?
00:26:07.900,00:26:09.760,长姐认识的 是采苹,00:26:07.900,00:26:09.760,"You know her, it's Lotus."
00:26:10.810,00:26:11.770,怎么是她呢,00:26:10.810,00:26:12.034,Why did you choose her?
00:26:12.480,00:26:13.390,她福气好,00:26:12.480,00:26:13.780,She is truly blessed.
00:26:13.780,00:26:16.140,皇上都已经封她为瑛答应了呢,00:26:13.780,00:26:16.257,His Majesty has already granted her the title Companion Lustré.
00:26:25.500,00:26:26.160,皇上,00:26:25.500,00:26:26.386,Your Majesty.
00:26:27.000,00:26:28.240,敬事房的人来了,00:26:27.000,00:26:28.429, Attendant Services is here.
00:26:36.420,00:26:37.210,皇上,00:26:36.420,00:26:37.440,Your Majesty.
00:26:41.220,00:26:43.550,果郡王府的人送来了,00:26:41.220,00:26:43.466,The one from Noble Prince Guo's estate has arrived?
,,,00:26:43.466,00:26:44.406,[Companion Lustré]
00:26:44.180,00:26:47.050,是 已经住进长春宫了,00:26:44.406,00:26:47.050,"Yes, she has moved into the Palace of Eternal Spring."
00:26:47.310,00:26:48.010,长得怎么样,00:26:47.310,00:26:48.439,How does she look?
00:26:48.810,00:26:50.640,这是玉福晋亲自挑的人,00:26:48.810,00:26:50.791,She was personally selected by Lady Yuyin.
00:26:50.980,00:26:52.060,自然错不了,00:26:50.980,00:26:52.135,Your Majesty can trust her.
00:26:52.560,00:26:53.900,果郡王府有心了,00:26:52.560,00:26:54.089,It was very thoughtful of Noble Prince Guo's estate.
00:26:58.860,00:27:00.520,这一阵前朝繁忙,00:26:58.860,00:27:00.860,"Lately, it's been very busy at the imperial court."
00:27:00.860,00:27:02.600,一直没空陪你出来走走,00:27:00.860,00:27:02.713,I haven't had time to take a walk with you.
00:27:03.910,00:27:05.900,皇上今日算是补偿吗,00:27:03.910,00:27:06.164,So today Your Majesty compensates me with your time?
00:27:06.910,00:27:07.900,你又笑话朕,00:27:06.910,00:27:08.164, You are teasing me again.
00:27:28.930,00:27:31.020,你是故意叫朕看见的吗,00:27:28.930,00:27:31.171,Did you intentionally bring me here to see this?
00:27:31.850,00:27:32.640,无需故意,00:27:31.850,00:27:33.017,I don't need to.
00:27:33.520,00:27:34.930,这样的事天天都会有,00:27:33.520,00:27:35.270,This can be seen every day.
00:27:36.690,00:27:37.730,情深至此,00:27:36.690,00:27:38.560,Having strong and deep feelings like this...
00:27:38.740,00:27:40.440,四郎与环环都是过来人,00:27:38.740,00:27:40.704,Si Lang and Huan Huan have experienced this ourselves.
00:27:40.900,00:27:42.110,何不成全了他们,00:27:40.900,00:27:42.619,Why not grant them their wish?
00:27:42.780,00:27:45.400,熹贵妃 你那么聪明,00:27:42.780,00:27:45.400,"Noble Consort Lumière, you are so clever."
00:27:46.240,00:27:48.780,应该看得出朕对玉娆的心意,00:27:46.240,00:27:49.166,You must have noticed my feelings towards Yurao.
00:27:49.710,00:27:51.370,皇上比臣妾聪明百倍,00:27:49.710,00:27:51.731,Your Majesty is far more clever than I am.
00:27:51.920,00:27:54.530,怎会不知襄王有意 神女无梦,00:27:51.920,00:27:55.144,"Your Majesty knows the story of
King Xiang's unrequited love for the goddess Yaoji."
00:27:56.960,00:27:58.330,朕自有办法,00:27:56.960,00:27:58.556,I have my ways.
00:27:58.960,00:28:00.200,即便皇上有办法,00:27:58.960,00:28:00.920,"Even if Your Majesty can find a way,"
00:28:00.920,00:28:02.330,也得问问玉娆的意思,00:28:00.960,00:28:02.682,you should ask Yurao's opinion.
00:28:03.550,00:28:05.170,若不然勉强又有何益呢,00:28:03.474,00:28:06.070,There's nothing to be gained by forcing her.
00:28:07.430,00:28:09.260,慎贝勒又是您的亲弟弟,00:28:07.430,00:28:09.817,And Venerable Prince Shen is your own brother.
00:28:18.900,00:28:21.140,皇上并不赞同我和你在一起,00:28:18.900,00:28:21.612,His Majesty disapproves of us being together.
00:28:22.030,00:28:24.610,皇兄若不许 我便一直求他,00:28:22.030,00:28:24.993,"If my imperial brother won't give us his blessing,
I will keep asking him."
00:28:25.780,00:28:28.190,他若不允 我便和十七哥一样,00:28:25.780,00:28:27.183,"If he still doesn't allow it,"
,,,00:28:27.183,00:28:28.990,I'll follow in my 17th brother's footsteps
00:28:28.990,00:28:29.700,一直不娶,00:28:28.990,00:28:30.000,and not get married at all.
00:28:30.750,00:28:32.950,总之 我不辜负你,00:28:30.750,00:28:33.250,"No matter what happens, I will live up to our commitment,"
00:28:33.790,00:28:34.650,也绝不娶旁人,00:28:33.790,00:28:35.235,and I won't marry anyone else.
00:28:37.420,00:28:39.030,我知道一切尘埃未定,00:28:37.420,00:28:39.590,I know nothing has been settled.
00:28:39.590,00:28:40.620,你总有许多不放心,00:28:39.590,00:28:41.630,And you may have many concerns.
00:28:41.630,00:28:42.670,那么我只答你一句,00:28:41.630,00:28:43.680,"But listen when I say,"
00:28:43.680,00:28:44.290,你放心,00:28:43.680,00:28:44.800,don't worry.
00:28:45.840,00:28:46.550,我知道,00:28:45.840,00:28:46.879,I understand.
00:28:49.560,00:28:50.590,去瑛答应那儿,00:28:49.560,00:28:51.480,Go to Companion Lustré's place.
00:28:51.480,00:28:52.390,皇上您忘了,00:28:51.480,00:28:53.060,Your Majesty has forgotten.
00:28:53.060,00:28:54.890,今儿您封了瑛答应为常在,00:28:53.060,00:28:54.890, You promoted Companion Lustré to Attendant today.
00:28:55.400,00:28:57.140,这会儿正在行册封礼呢,00:28:55.400,00:28:57.140,The ceremony is going on right now.
00:28:59.190,00:29:02.780,罢了 那一时半会儿还结不了呢,00:28:59.190,00:29:02.780,"Never mind then, it won't be over for a while."
00:29:04.950,00:29:07.650,皇上 那咱们现在去,00:29:04.950,00:29:07.650,Then Your Majesty would like to go to ...?
00:29:09.280,00:29:10.240,去延禧宫,00:29:09.280,00:29:11.059,To the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:29:10.870,00:29:12.700,摆驾延禧宫,00:29:11.059,00:29:13.040,To the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:29:14.080,00:29:15.240,皇上拂袖而去,00:29:14.080,00:29:15.830,His Majesty left you without a word ...
00:29:15.830,00:29:17.160,不知道是怎么个意思啊,00:29:15.830,00:29:17.160,what does that mean?
00:29:17.750,00:29:20.120,无论什么意思 我都得这么做,00:29:17.750,00:29:20.120,"I had to show him, no matter what he meant."
00:29:21.260,00:29:23.040,奴婢担心皇上真的生气了,00:29:21.260,00:29:24.762,I'm afraid that His Majesty could be upset and become angry at Your Highness.
00:29:23.300,00:29:24.290,会迁怒了娘娘,,,
00:29:27.590,00:29:28.300,长姐,00:29:27.590,00:29:28.670,Elder sister.
00:29:30.510,00:29:33.130,你看你 满脸的汗也不知道擦一擦,00:29:30.510,00:29:33.130,Look at you. You have beads of sweat all over your face.
00:29:33.810,00:29:35.020,越发像个小孩子了,00:29:33.810,00:29:35.020,Still acting like a child.
00:29:37.190,00:29:39.100,今日去见了慎贝勒还高兴吗,00:29:37.190,00:29:39.271,Was it nice seeing Venerable Prince Shen today?
00:29:39.520,00:29:40.100,高兴,00:29:39.520,00:29:40.100,Yes.

00:29:49.120,00:29:50.030,长姐,00:29:49.120,00:29:50.030,Elder sister.
00:29:52.200,00:29:53.280,只要你高兴,00:29:52.200,00:29:53.506,I would do anything
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.530,长姐为你做什么都愿意,00:29:54.000,00:29:55.530,as long as it makes you happy.
00:30:42.840,00:30:43.620,皇上万安,00:30:42.840,00:30:44.200,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:30:44.960,00:30:45.670,起来吧,00:30:44.960,00:30:46.040,Rise.
00:30:48.970,00:30:50.500,你弹的是淇奥,00:30:48.970,00:30:51.100,"You were playing ""Hymn to a Gentleman."""
00:30:51.600,00:30:55.430,玉娆已经有了思慕的君子了吗,00:30:51.600,00:30:55.430,"Is there a gentleman you admire, Yurao?"
00:30:56.890,00:30:58.130,可知朕为君子,00:30:56.890,00:30:58.774,"As a gentleman myself,"
00:30:58.560,00:31:00.180,很喜欢弹琴的玉娆,00:30:58.774,00:31:00.780," I am very fond of Yurao, the zither player."
00:31:01.560,00:31:02.680,皇上喜欢臣女,00:31:01.560,00:31:02.900,Is your Majesty fond of me
00:31:02.900,00:31:04.140,是因为姐姐的缘故吗,00:31:02.900,00:31:04.397,because of my sister?
00:31:04.780,00:31:06.560,都说玉娆和姐姐长得像,00:31:04.780,00:31:06.560,Everybody says I resemble my sister.
00:31:06.900,00:31:09.560,你像她 又不像她,00:31:06.900,00:31:09.560,"You resemble her, yet don't resemble her."
00:31:10.610,00:31:11.520,更多了些,00:31:10.610,00:31:12.000,You have the beauty
00:31:11.910,00:31:14.440,天不怕地不怕的英气妩媚,00:31:12.120,00:31:14.720,that accompanies fearlessness and daring.
00:31:15.580,00:31:16.490,论容貌,00:31:15.580,00:31:17.120,"By appearance,"
00:31:17.700,00:31:19.540,其实你很像朕的妻子,00:31:17.700,00:31:19.540,you resemble my wife a lot.
00:31:20.250,00:31:20.950,真的吗,00:31:20.250,00:31:20.950,Really?
00:31:21.210,00:31:23.290,臣女与皇后仿佛并不相像,00:31:20.950,00:31:23.459,I don't think I look very similar to the Empress.
00:31:23.920,00:31:26.460,她是皇后 不是朕的妻子,00:31:23.920,00:31:26.717,"She is the Empress, but she is not my wife."
00:31:27.170,00:31:30.040,朕的妻子很早就离开人世了,00:31:27.170,00:31:30.040,My wife departed this world a long time ago.
00:31:30.680,00:31:31.540,臣女知道了,00:31:30.680,00:31:31.970,I understand.
00:31:31.970,00:31:33.830,皇上可以有很多个皇后,00:31:31.970,00:31:34.390,"Your Majesty can have many Empresses,"
00:31:34.390,00:31:36.050,但是妻子只有一个,00:31:34.390,00:31:36.307,but only one wife.
00:31:37.100,00:31:38.010,你很聪明,00:31:37.100,00:31:38.353,You are very clever.
00:31:38.930,00:31:39.800,那么姐姐呢,00:31:38.930,00:31:40.186,What about my sister?
00:31:40.390,00:31:43.850,你姐姐是朕身边最重要的女人,00:31:40.390,00:31:44.193,Your sister is the most important woman by my side.
00:31:45.730,00:31:47.020,你问了朕这么多,00:31:45.730,00:31:47.308,You have asked me many questions.
00:31:48.030,00:31:49.640,可也想做朕的女人吗,00:31:48.230,00:31:50.809,"Is it because you wish to be my woman, like your sister?"
00:31:51.570,00:31:53.690,臣女很羡慕皇上的妻子,00:31:51.570,00:31:53.690,I envy Your Majesty's wife.
00:31:54.660,00:31:55.360,为什么,00:31:54.660,00:31:55.950,Why is that?
00:31:55.950,00:31:57.740,皇上的妻子虽然早逝,00:31:55.950,00:31:58.200,"Although she left this world too soon,"
00:31:58.200,00:32:00.870,可是皇上心里只认她一人为妻子,00:31:58.200,00:32:00.870,Your Majesty thinks of her as your only wife.
00:32:01.370,00:32:02.410,时常想着她,00:32:01.370,00:32:02.924,You think about her often.
00:32:03.210,00:32:05.120,皇上说喜欢玉娆对不对,00:32:03.210,00:32:05.549,"Your Majesty said you are fond of me, right?"
00:32:06.000,00:32:06.620,是,00:32:06.000,00:32:06.620,Yes.
00:32:07.170,00:32:09.250,臣女自小便有一个愿望,00:32:07.170,00:32:09.630,I've had a dream since I was young
00:32:09.630,00:32:12.000,就是希望成为心爱男子的妻子,00:32:09.630,00:32:12.300,to be the wife of the man I love.
00:32:12.300,00:32:14.590,不是妾 不是最重要的女子,00:32:12.300,00:32:14.970,"Not a concubine, nor the most important woman,"
00:32:14.970,00:32:16.760,而是惟一最爱的妻子,00:32:14.970,00:32:16.960,but the one and only wife that he loves.
00:32:17.850,00:32:20.560,只可惜皇上已经有自己的妻子,00:32:17.850,00:32:20.980,"It's a pity that Your Majesty already has your own wife,"
00:32:20.980,00:32:22.430,不能满足臣女的愿望,00:32:20.980,00:32:23.060,and cannot fulfill my dream.
00:32:23.060,00:32:25.390,所以臣女希望自己有朝一日,00:32:23.060,00:32:25.390,I hope that one day
00:32:25.770,00:32:27.010,能够实现自己的愿望,00:32:25.390,00:32:27.480,I will see my dream come true
00:32:27.480,00:32:29.520,而不是永远羡慕皇上的妻子,00:32:27.480,00:32:29.520,instead of living in envy of Your Majesty's wife.
00:32:33.570,00:32:36.810,朕说过你很聪明 很像你姐姐,00:32:33.570,00:32:36.810,"As I said, you are very clever, just like your sister."
00:32:37.490,00:32:39.200,这不是聪明 而是事实,00:32:37.490,00:32:40.000,"This is not cleverness, this is a fact."
00:32:40.000,00:32:42.780,皇上若喜欢臣女 将臣女留在宫中,00:32:40.000,00:32:42.780,"Even if your Majesty likes me enough
to make me stay in your harem,"
00:32:43.170,00:32:44.830,又能给臣女带来什么呢,00:32:43.170,00:32:45.173,what would that do for me?
00:32:45.420,00:32:47.910,还是废了皇后 让臣女入主景仁宫,00:32:45.420,00:32:48.339,"Even if you banished the Empress and gave me her palace,"
00:32:48.920,00:32:50.580,皇后也只不过是皇后,00:32:48.920,00:32:50.751,"the Empress is only the Empress,"
00:32:50.960,00:32:52.200,并非皇上的妻子,00:32:50.751,00:32:52.500,not Your Majesty's true wife.
00:32:53.180,00:32:54.160,恕臣女多嘴,00:32:53.180,00:32:55.217,Please forgive me for speaking so candidly.
00:32:54.840,00:32:57.550,皇上与您的妻子都很喜欢彼此吧,00:32:55.217,00:32:57.936,"Your Majesty and your wife
must have cherished each other dearly."
00:33:02.430,00:33:04.390,臣女与允禧两情相悦,00:33:02.173,00:33:04.690,I feel a strong affinity with Yunxi.
00:33:04.690,00:33:05.850,臣女不敢请求皇上,,,
00:33:06.190,00:33:07.680,让臣女做允禧的正妻,00:33:04.690,00:33:07.900,I dare not request Your Majesty to make me Yunxi's primary wife.
00:33:07.900,00:33:09.510,即便做他的侍妾也无妨,00:33:07.900,00:33:10.000,"Even if I were his concubine, I would be happy."
00:33:09.980,00:33:11.100,只求皇上,00:33:10.000,00:33:11.360,I only beg your Majesty
00:33:11.360,00:33:13.100,能让臣女与允禧在一起,00:33:11.360,00:33:13.100,to let me be with him.
00:33:13.780,00:33:15.940,你不是只愿意做他的妻子吗,00:33:13.780,00:33:16.283,Don't you only want to become his wife?
00:33:16.950,00:33:19.190,皇后是皇上名分上的妻子,00:33:16.950,00:33:19.700,"Although in name the Empress is Your Majesty's wife,"
00:33:19.700,00:33:21.910,可是皇上却不把她视作妻子,00:33:19.700,00:33:22.620,Your Majesty doesn't consider her to be your wife.
00:33:22.620,00:33:23.910,臣女虽然来日,00:33:22.620,00:33:24.250,"Although in the future,"
00:33:24.250,00:33:26.360,并不能成为允禧名分上的妻子,00:33:24.250,00:33:26.750,"I may not be Yunxi's wife by name,"
00:33:26.750,00:33:28.210,可是他心里只有我,00:33:26.750,00:33:28.460,but he cherishes only me in his heart
00:33:28.460,00:33:29.500,我心里也只有他,00:33:28.460,00:33:30.000,and I him.
00:33:30.000,00:33:32.240,臣女知道 他不会再娶其他女子,00:33:30.000,00:33:32.670,I know that he will never marry another woman.
00:33:32.670,00:33:34.750,臣女是他心中惟一最爱之人,00:33:32.670,00:33:35.260,"I will be his only love, the only one in his heart."
00:33:35.260,00:33:36.370,不就是他的妻子吗,00:33:35.260,00:33:37.485,Doesn't that mean I am his wife?
00:33:38.930,00:33:39.630,你起来吧,00:33:38.930,00:33:39.630,Rise.
00:33:40.310,00:33:42.010,臣女知道皇上喜欢臣女,00:33:40.310,00:33:42.470,I know that your Majesty is fond of me.
00:33:42.470,00:33:45.060,既然喜欢就应该成全对方的心意,00:33:42.470,00:33:45.060,"If you are fond of someone, you should fulfill their wish."
00:33:45.690,00:33:46.420,除了皇后,00:33:45.690,00:33:46.690,"Aside from the Empress,"
00:33:46.690,00:33:48.470,皇上身边还有许多女子,00:33:46.690,00:33:48.684,Your Majesty has many women around you.
00:33:49.480,00:33:50.720,臣女入宫不久,00:33:49.480,00:33:50.940,"I haven't been in the palace long,"
00:33:50.940,00:33:51.600,便已看见姐姐,,,
00:33:51.860,00:33:53.350,受了这么多风波周折,00:33:50.940,00:33:53.570,but long enough to see my sister go through many disturbances.
00:33:53.570,00:33:54.730,姐姐虽然是皇上认为,00:33:53.570,00:33:56.200,"Although Your Majesty considers my sister
your most important woman,"
00:33:55.110,00:33:55.940,最重要的女子,,,
00:33:56.200,00:33:57.980,却也过得如此辛苦小心,00:33:56.200,00:33:58.780,she is still on her guard every day.
00:33:58.780,00:34:01.070,臣女不愿将来也过那样的日子,00:33:58.969,00:34:01.601,I don't wish to live that kind of life.
00:34:04.910,00:34:06.490,皇上的喜欢难能可贵,00:34:04.910,00:34:06.790,Your Majesty's fondness for me is precious.
00:34:06.790,00:34:07.620,臣女不敢辜负,00:34:06.790,00:34:08.040,I dare not squander it.
00:34:08.040,00:34:10.870,但世间的喜欢并非只有男女之情,00:34:08.040,00:34:11.670,"But fondness need not only be
that between a man and a woman."
00:34:11.670,00:34:12.280,请皇上,00:34:11.670,00:34:12.762,I plead with Your Majesty
00:34:12.460,00:34:14.500,像喜欢小妹一样喜欢臣女吧,00:34:12.762,00:34:14.915,"to treat me with the fondness
you have for a younger sister."
00:34:17.590,00:34:19.750,这是皇上交由臣女保管之物,00:34:17.590,00:34:20.000,Your Majesty entrusted this item to me.
00:34:20.510,00:34:21.800,臣女完璧归赵,00:34:20.510,00:34:22.470,It returns untarnished to its rightful owner.
00:34:22.470,00:34:25.130,也请皇上了臣女与允禧夙愿,00:34:22.659,00:34:25.938,"I request that Your Majesty fulfill the wish
long cherished by Yunxi and myself."
00:34:39.280,00:34:42.320,这玉佩朕赐给你了,00:34:39.280,00:34:42.320,This jade pendant - I grant it to you as a gift.
00:35:01.720,00:35:03.840,皇上 这灯都暗了,00:35:01.720,00:35:04.220,"Your Majesty, the lamp is already burning low."
00:35:04.220,00:35:06.510,小心看伤了眼,00:35:04.220,00:35:07.020,It might strain your eyes.
00:35:07.020,00:35:08.800,奴才给您换一盏亮的,00:35:07.020,00:35:08.889,I brought you a new one.
00:35:09.480,00:35:10.180,苏培盛,00:35:09.480,00:35:10.520,Su Peisheng.
00:35:11.610,00:35:12.220,皇上,00:35:11.610,00:35:12.597,Your Majesty.
00:35:13.150,00:35:15.640,朕看上一个女子,00:35:13.150,00:35:15.640,"There is a lady that I'm fond of,"
00:35:16.280,00:35:18.690,想要纳她为妃她却不肯,00:35:16.280,00:35:18.864,but she is unwilling to become my concubine.
00:35:19.650,00:35:20.390,你怎么看,00:35:19.650,00:35:20.616,What do you think?
00:35:20.780,00:35:21.520,皇上,00:35:20.780,00:35:21.520,"Your Majesty,"
00:35:22.570,00:35:24.860,奴才不知道这个女子是何人,00:35:22.570,00:35:25.068,"I do not know who this lady is,"
00:35:25.370,00:35:26.360,但奴才觉得,00:35:25.370,00:35:26.910,but in my mind，
00:35:26.910,00:35:30.500,再好的女子也比不上纯元皇后啊,00:35:26.910,00:35:30.500,no woman can compare to Empress Première.
00:35:30.920,00:35:32.250,你这话是什么意思,00:35:30.920,00:35:32.533,What do you mean by that?
00:35:32.790,00:35:33.780,奴才是觉得,00:35:32.790,00:35:33.780,"I meant,"
00:35:34.500,00:35:36.120,皇上喜欢谁都不要紧,00:35:34.500,00:35:36.550,it does not matter who Your Majesty is fond of.
00:35:36.550,00:35:39.250,能替纯元皇后伺候皇上高兴,00:35:36.550,00:35:39.590,"If this person is able to serve Your Majesty
 in the way that Empress Première could,"
00:35:39.590,00:35:41.050,那才是她的福气呢,00:35:39.590,00:35:41.352,she must be truly blessed.
00:35:43.760,00:35:44.720,你呀,00:35:43.760,00:35:44.720,Your eyes...
00:35:46.770,00:35:48.260,看东西太毒,00:35:46.770,00:35:48.640,they see things too sharply!
00:35:51.650,00:35:55.230,好了 朕有件事交代你去办,00:35:51.650,00:35:55.230,"All right, I have a task for you."
00:35:55.690,00:35:56.400,皇上盼咐,00:35:55.690,00:35:56.626,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:35:56.820,00:35:58.180,熹贵妃嫁妹,00:35:56.820,00:35:59.280,The sister of Noble Consort Lumière will get married
00:35:59.280,00:36:02.520,可按多罗格格出嫁之仪备办嫁妆,00:35:59.280,00:36:02.520,following the protocol for a princess of the fourth rank.

00:36:09.500,00:36:10.610,太后一直病着,00:36:09.515,00:36:11.444,The Empress Dowager has been ill for some time.
00:36:11.670,00:36:13.580,宫里多出些喜事,,,
00:36:14.750,00:36:17.240,就当是为太后冲冲喜吧,00:36:11.670,00:36:17.524,Let's hope the auspicious events will dispel the evil spirits.

00:36:22.180,00:36:23.630,这乃是少有的佳话呀,00:36:22.180,00:36:24.169,These romantic tales are few and far between.
00:36:24.340,00:36:26.260,太后要是知道这样的喜事,00:36:24.169,00:36:26.260,"When the Empress Dowager knows about this,"
00:36:26.600,00:36:27.680,一定会好起来的,00:36:26.600,00:36:28.057,it will definitely help her condition!
00:36:46.070,00:36:48.410,太后 太后,00:36:46.070,00:36:48.410,"Your Majesty, Your Majesty."
00:36:51.450,00:36:52.910,哀家怕是不行了,00:36:51.450,00:36:52.910,I think my time has come.
00:36:54.750,00:36:56.410,太后 您别这样说,00:36:54.750,00:36:56.410,"Your Majesty, please don't say that!"
00:36:57.250,00:36:59.040,太医们都在外面等着呢,00:36:57.250,00:36:59.300,"The imperial doctors are all waiting outside,"
00:36:59.300,00:37:01.000,奴婢这就把他们传进来,00:36:59.300,00:37:01.000,I will call them in now.

00:37:07.430,00:37:08.510,可是脑子里,00:37:07.430,00:37:09.214,even when my mind is muddled
00:37:09.600,00:37:11.680,老是在转着一个念头,00:37:09.600,00:37:11.680,while I've been sick.
00:37:14.440,00:37:15.470,哀家为了,,,

00:37:26.660,00:37:28.070,是不是错了,00:37:26.299,00:37:28.740,Was I wrong to do so?
00:37:28.740,00:37:29.480,太后,00:37:28.740,00:37:29.669,"Your Majesty,"
00:37:30.580,00:37:32.070,您可别这样说,00:37:30.580,00:37:32.584,please don't say that.
00:37:33.500,00:37:34.660,当初宜修,00:37:33.500,00:37:35.003,I knew Yixiu ...
00:37:36.210,00:37:38.320,如何对纯元下的手,00:37:36.210,00:37:38.320,what she did to Première...
00:37:40.130,00:37:41.740,哀家不是不知道,00:37:40.130,00:37:42.640,I knew everything
00:37:43.800,00:37:45.250,是没有办法,00:37:43.800,00:37:45.733,but there was nothing I could do.
00:37:48.050,00:37:49.290,宜修一死,00:37:48.050,00:37:50.000,"If Yixiu dies,"
00:37:50.970,00:37:52.210,乌拉那拉氏,00:37:50.970,00:37:53.140,the Ulanara clan will have no one
00:37:53.140,00:37:55.720,就再没有承继后位的人了,00:37:53.140,00:37:55.720,to succeed to the throne.
00:37:58.350,00:38:03.690,哀家千辛万苦成为太后,00:37:58.350,00:38:03.690,I suffered every hardship to become the Empress Dowager.
00:38:05.610,00:38:10.030,一辈子的心血不能断送,00:38:05.610,00:38:10.030,My efforts in this life cannot be wasted.
00:38:12.200,00:38:14.160,所以纵使知道,00:38:12.200,00:38:14.160,So even though I knew
00:38:17.000,00:38:19.580,宜修她残害妃嫔皇嗣,00:38:16.786,00:38:19.580,"she had been murdering imperial concubines and heirs,"
00:38:21.750,00:38:23.460,哀家也不得不,00:38:21.750,00:38:23.889,I had no choice but to
00:38:25.670,00:38:28.710,一直保住她的后位,00:38:25.670,00:38:28.710,protect her and her throne.
00:38:30.010,00:38:31.880,太后多番劝过皇后,00:38:30.010,00:38:32.609,"Your Majesty repeatedly admonished the Empress,"
00:38:32.760,00:38:34.680,是皇后自己执迷不悟,00:38:32.760,00:38:35.701,but she became fixated on her obsessions.
00:38:35.890,00:38:37.930,是皇后害死了那么多人,00:38:35.890,00:38:38.567,She is the one who has caused so many deaths.
00:38:39.020,00:38:42.600,她若早听太后的 收手就好了,00:38:39.020,00:38:42.600,If only she had listened to you and stopped her wrongdoing!
00:38:43.270,00:38:44.890,哀家再不喜欢她,00:38:43.270,00:38:45.533,"No matter how much I dislike her,"
00:38:46.570,00:38:50.480,也得顾全全族的荣耀,00:38:46.570,00:38:50.480,I had to take into account the glory of the entire clan.
00:38:56.540,00:38:57.620,这些日子,00:38:56.540,00:38:57.771,These past few days...
00:38:59.620,00:39:03.160,哀家夜夜梦见纯元,00:38:59.620,00:39:03.160,I've dreamt of Première night after night.
00:39:05.840,00:39:08.080,哀家实在对不住她,00:39:05.840,00:39:08.080,How deep is my remorse for her!
00:39:09.130,00:39:10.420,太后您说过,00:39:09.130,00:39:10.420,Your Majesty once said
00:39:11.140,00:39:13.220,纯元皇后性子太柔,00:39:11.140,00:39:13.220,"Empress Première was too kind,"
00:39:14.140,00:39:16.130,不是正位中宫之人,00:39:14.140,00:39:17.100,and therefore not suitable as the head of the harem.
00:39:17.100,00:39:18.340,惟有宜修,00:39:17.100,00:39:18.800,Only Yixiu
00:39:19.270,00:39:21.390,才能保住皇后的宝座,00:39:19.270,00:39:23.800,"would not yield her grip on the Empress's throne
to anyone else."
00:39:22.020,00:39:23.810,不落入她人之手,,,
00:39:24.900,00:39:26.730,哀家也对不住皇帝,00:39:24.900,00:39:26.919,I feel remorseful towards the emperor too
00:39:28.700,00:39:31.610,对不住哀家那些枉死的皇孙,00:39:28.700,00:39:32.543,and all of my innocent imperial grandchildren.
00:39:35.410,00:39:36.570,可是如今,00:39:35.410,00:39:36.570,But now
00:39:38.450,00:39:40.950,哀家劝得住皇帝一日,00:39:38.450,00:39:41.636,"I can only advise the Emperor day to day,"
00:39:42.750,00:39:44.620,劝不住一辈子,00:39:42.750,00:39:44.620,but not for the days to come.
00:39:47.380,00:39:49.090,哀家的心血,00:39:47.380,00:39:49.430,I've dedicated my whole life...
00:39:49.720,00:39:51.630,您就别操心那么多了,00:39:49.720,00:39:52.144,"Please stop worrying so much, Your Majesty."
00:39:52.720,00:39:53.500,竹息,00:39:52.720,00:39:53.500,Bamboo...
00:39:55.050,00:39:56.420,拿纸笔墨来,00:39:55.050,00:39:56.806,Bring me paper and ink.
00:39:58.140,00:40:01.880,哀家 哀家要留下一道遗诏,00:39:58.140,00:40:02.745,I... I have to write down an edict for the future ...
00:40:02.900,00:40:03.980,以防万一,00:40:02.745,00:40:03.960,just in case.
00:40:04.520,00:40:07.810,太后 您要多注意您的身子,00:40:04.520,00:40:07.810,"Your Majesty, please be mindful of your health."
00:40:10.990,00:40:11.980,你要记着,00:40:10.990,00:40:11.980,You must remember
00:40:15.330,00:40:17.030,万一哀家不在了,00:40:15.330,00:40:17.030,"one day when I am no more,"
00:40:18.540,00:40:20.450,你要收好这道遗诏,00:40:18.540,00:40:20.450,you must keep this edict safe.
,,,00:40:23.290,00:40:24.344,If any ...
00:40:23.290,00:40:27.160,哪日后位若有变故,00:40:25.145,00:40:27.516,"incident happens to alter the Empress's throne,"
00:40:28.710,00:40:32.550,拿出来保护皇后,00:40:28.710,00:40:32.550,you must use my edict to protect Yixiu.

00:41:16.840,00:41:18.760,恭送皇上,00:41:16.840,00:41:18.760,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:41:34.610,00:41:35.690,方才席间,00:41:34.610,00:41:36.290,"Just now at the table,"

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."
00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"He loved me with a volatile heart.
And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."
00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"Behind me are the promises and longing.
Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:36.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
but I’m left with only the flute and the zither."

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;
With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."
00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,My love was the wind-swept flowers from a tree.,00:44:02.000,00:44:14.000,"My unwavering love is gone
like flowers swept away in the wind."
00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"A plum bloomed in winter hoping for a fruitful summer.
But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
