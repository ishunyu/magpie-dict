00:02:21.680,00:02:23.670,富察贵人遭此横祸,,,
00:02:23.880,00:02:25.350,是因为她腹中的孩子,00:02:22.860,00:02:26.480,This accident occurred to Lady Fuca because she was with child.
00:02:26.160,00:02:28.190,现在她腹中的孩子没有了,00:02:27.340,00:02:29.460,Now she has lost her child
00:02:28.800,00:02:31.550,而你却有了,00:02:29.940,00:02:32.700,while you just got pregnant.
00:02:33.080,00:02:34.590,嫔妾多谢娘娘提醒,00:02:34.220,00:02:36.460,I appreciate Your Highness's kind concern.
00:02:37.280,00:02:38.420,幼子无辜,00:02:38.480,00:02:40.100,An innocent child has died.
00:02:39.400,00:02:43.150,这孩子呀 都是父母的心血精华,00:02:40.600,00:02:44.220,Parents put their heart and soul into raising their child.
00:02:44.480,00:02:46.750,本宫看着也是不忍心,00:02:45.680,00:02:47.920,I couldn't bear to see another child die.
00:02:47.360,00:02:49.510,就当给这个孩子积福吧,00:02:48.460,00:02:51.020,I hope your child will be more blessed by Heaven.
00:02:55.200,00:02:57.660,嫔妾多谢娘娘对腹中胎儿的垂怜,00:02:56.280,00:02:58.620,I thank Your Highness for your caring and compassionate words.
00:02:57.920,00:03:00.110,快快 这是如何 快快请起,00:02:58.700,00:03:01.320,"No, no. Please rise."
00:03:03.400,00:03:06.710,我既然说了 那我就再多说一句,00:03:04.520,00:03:07.860,"Since I am here, I have one more thing to say."
00:03:07.200,00:03:10.110,曹琴默是比华妃更难缠的人,00:03:08.300,00:03:11.700,Cao Qinmo is even more difficult to deal with than Consort Fleur.
00:03:11.600,00:03:13.390,此人蕴锋刃于无形,00:03:12.800,00:03:14.980,"She ""hides daggers behind smiles""."
00:03:14.240,00:03:16.350,我数次都险些吃了她的暗亏,00:03:15.320,00:03:17.860,I almost fell into the traps she laid a few times.
00:03:17.520,00:03:18.990,华妃若是猛虎,00:03:18.780,00:03:20.560,"If Consort Fleur is a fierce tiger,"
00:03:19.600,00:03:21.900,曹琴默就是猛虎上的利爪,00:03:20.840,00:03:23.500,Cao Qinmo is the tiger's sharp claws.
00:03:22.840,00:03:25.790,不过 你要知道锋刃在谁的手中,00:03:24.040,00:03:26.820,"But as long as you know where the daggers come from,"
00:03:26.000,00:03:27.190,就能小心避开,00:03:27.000,00:03:29.000,you will be able to avoid them.
00:03:29.320,00:03:30.990,只怕是身受其害,,,
00:03:31.440,00:03:33.590,却连对手都不知道是谁,00:03:30.200,00:03:35.980,Standing in harm's way but not knowing who your opponent is ...
00:03:33.880,00:03:39.000,那才是真正的可怕呀,,,
00:03:39.400,00:03:41.390,娘娘的身子怎么总不见好呢,00:03:38.900,00:03:40.560,is the most dreadful.
,,,00:03:40.560,00:03:42.900,Your Highness's health doesn't seen to be improving.
00:03:42.840,00:03:43.870,我认得一位太医,00:03:43.960,00:03:45.160,I know an imperial doctor.
00:03:44.200,00:03:46.070,不如引荐了为娘娘医治吧,00:03:45.340,00:03:47.320,May I introduce him to treat Your Highness?
00:03:46.720,00:03:47.860,不劳费心了,00:03:47.840,00:03:49.520,Thanks for offering to help.
00:03:48.760,00:03:51.220,那是本宫早年间伤了身子,00:03:49.860,00:03:52.440,My health was damaged when I was young.
00:03:52.200,00:03:55.070,我实在体力不支 我要回去了,00:03:53.260,00:03:56.180,I feel really tired. I must go now.
00:03:55.840,00:03:57.950,那嫔妾让人送娘娘回去,00:03:56.900,00:03:59.140,I will ask my servants to go with Your Highness.
00:04:00.160,00:04:01.270,不可张扬,00:04:01.240,00:04:02.920,No one else should know.
00:04:02.800,00:04:05.260,这件事情皇帝知道吗,00:04:04.740,00:04:06.960,Does the Emperor know about this?
00:04:06.560,00:04:07.830,已经派人去了,,,
00:04:08.120,00:04:09.510,臣妾已经叮嘱过了,00:04:07.680,00:04:08.960,I've sent the messengers.
00:04:10.200,00:04:12.790,怕皇上伤心 要缓缓地说,00:04:09.360,00:04:13.580,"I have instructed them to report in an unhurried and calming manner,"
00:04:13.040,00:04:15.030,另外要多提莞贵人有孕之事,00:04:13.940,00:04:16.900,and emphasize Lady Sourire's pregnancy.
00:04:16.960,00:04:20.070,希望皇帝知道莞贵人有孕,00:04:18.040,00:04:23.080,I hope he will feel less unhappy knowing Lady Sourire is pregnant.
00:04:21.040,00:04:22.180,会高兴些,,,
00:04:22.600,00:04:23.950,臣妾也是这样想的,00:04:23.680,00:04:25.180,"I hope so, too."
00:04:25.280,00:04:26.830,皇上再难过,,,
00:04:27.080,00:04:29.190,毕竟还有莞贵人腹中的孩子呢,00:04:26.480,00:04:30.180,His Majesty will find comfort in Lady Sourire's child.
00:04:30.280,00:04:32.840,再不然 后宫那么多缤妃,,,
00:04:33.200,00:04:35.150,总可以为皇上诞下龙种,00:04:31.400,00:04:36.140,"It will help him recognize that other concubines will
also be able to carry imperial heirs."
00:04:36.080,00:04:38.070,富察贵人保不住就算了,00:04:37.220,00:04:39.500,There's nothing we can do about Lady Fuca's child now.
00:04:39.080,00:04:40.550,但是莞贵人的孩子,,,
00:04:41.400,00:04:42.620,不能再有差错,00:04:40.300,00:04:44.120,But nothing can go wrong with Lady Sourire's child.
00:04:45.240,00:04:45.990,是,00:04:46.360,00:04:47.460,Yes.
00:04:49.240,00:04:52.550,皇额娘 臣妾还有一件事未禀报,00:04:50.520,00:04:53.840,"Imperial Mother, I have yet another thing to report."
00:04:54.160,00:04:54.910,什么,00:04:55.300,00:04:56.620,What is it?
00:04:55.720,00:04:59.550,华妃想请外头的大夫给她瞧瞧,00:04:56.880,00:05:00.500,Consort Fleur wishes to see a doctor from outside the palace.
00:05:00.760,00:05:03.140,好好的 怎么提起这事,00:05:01.840,00:05:04.240,Why did she suddenly bring this up?
00:05:03.600,00:05:04.990,华妃一直没有身孕,,,
00:05:05.240,00:05:06.710,认为宫中太医无能,00:05:04.740,00:05:07.980,"She has not been pregnant all these years
and thinks the imperial doctors are incompetent."
00:05:07.400,00:05:10.710,所以她想请外头的大夫给她看看,00:05:08.620,00:05:11.720,So she wishes to see a doctor from outside.
00:05:11.200,00:05:12.750,华妃是这样请旨的,00:05:12.360,00:05:14.480,That was what she said in her request.
00:05:13.720,00:05:15.990,听说也是年羹尧的主意,00:05:14.860,00:05:17.380,I heard Nian Gengyao approves the idea.
00:05:19.400,00:05:20.380,皇后觉得呢,,,
00:05:21.360,00:05:22.550,这事传出去,00:05:20.540,00:05:22.160,What do you think?
00:05:23.000,00:05:25.070,别人不知该怎么打量太医院呢,00:05:22.580,00:05:25.900,This would damage the reputation of the Imperial Infirmary.
00:05:25.640,00:05:27.030,怕是失了体面,00:05:26.800,00:05:28.960,I'm afraid it's not appropriate.
00:05:29.640,00:05:30.830,是有失体面,00:05:30.720,00:05:32.380,It's not.
00:05:32.720,00:05:34.150,但是若不答应,,,
00:05:34.400,00:05:37.750,按华妃的性子 她会一求再求,00:05:33.820,00:05:38.420,"But if her request is denied, she won't stop asking."
00:05:39.640,00:05:42.670,罢了 安排个人进来吧,00:05:40.900,00:05:43.680,"All right, we can arrange for a doctor's visit."
00:05:44.240,00:05:45.870,若真是个好大夫,00:05:45.420,00:05:47.060,"If it's a good doctor,"
00:05:46.400,00:05:49.110,华妃瞧完了 给竹息也瞧瞧,00:05:47.540,00:05:50.500,bring him here afterwards to check on Bamboo.
00:05:50.640,00:05:52.670,她跟着哀家年纪大了,,,
00:05:53.840,00:05:55.750,人总有不舒坦的时候,00:05:51.800,00:05:56.400,"After serving me all these years, now she
has times when she feels unwell."
00:05:56.760,00:05:59.750,是 孙姑姑若身体不舒服,00:05:57.860,00:06:00.840,"Yes, if Madam Bamboo is unwell,"
00:06:00.160,00:06:01.670,让他看看也方便,00:06:01.340,00:06:03.580,"it will be convenient for her to see a
visiting doctor during work."
00:06:05.800,00:06:06.940,华妃说得对,00:06:06.960,00:06:08.760,Consort Fleur is right.
00:06:08.160,00:06:10.390,净是些不温不火的太医,00:06:09.340,00:06:11.580,The doctors in the palace are just mediocre.
00:06:10.920,00:06:13.030,这病好得慢些,00:06:11.980,00:06:14.560,That's why people recover more slowly.
00:06:28.960,00:06:31.590,我乏了 得先歇着,00:06:30.200,00:06:33.060,I'm exhausted. I need to rest.
00:06:33.680,00:06:35.950,娘娘身子弱 原不能劳累的,00:06:34.400,00:06:36.720,Your Highness has a weak constitution.
00:06:36.680,00:06:38.710,今天不分白天黑夜地劳心劳力,,,
00:06:39.240,00:06:41.230,身子怎么吃得消,00:06:37.880,00:06:41.980,Your Highness must be exhausted - exerting your mind and body all day.
00:06:41.840,00:06:45.950,若不是为了想做的事还没有做完,00:06:43.040,00:06:47.020,"If not for the tasks my mind desires to do,"
00:06:47.280,00:06:50.470,我还要这副破身子干什么,00:06:48.480,00:06:51.280,I would have no reason to live in my debilitated body.
00:06:51.000,00:06:53.270,那娘娘也不用夜深露重去碎玉轩,00:06:52.100,00:06:54.600,But Your Highness didn't have to go out on this cold and frosted night
00:06:53.720,00:06:55.710,与莞贵人说那样多的话,00:06:54.760,00:06:57.000,and talk for so long with Lady Sourie.
00:06:57.200,00:06:58.950,孩子都是无辜的,00:06:58.320,00:07:00.380,All the children are innocent.
00:07:00.160,00:07:04.030,孩子无辜 做娘的也无辜,00:07:01.420,00:07:04.760,So are their mothers.
00:07:04.760,00:07:07.670,自然不能见死不救,00:07:05.800,00:07:08.820,I cannot look on when she's in peril.
00:07:11.240,00:07:15.150,只可惜我这一辈子,00:07:12.480,00:07:15.800,It's unfortunate that
00:07:16.600,00:07:18.830,都不会有孩子了,00:07:17.760,00:07:20.260,I won't have a child in this life.
00:07:45.240,00:07:47.350,娘娘 您不能再吃了,00:07:45.200,00:07:48.480,"Your Highness, please stop eating."
00:07:47.600,00:07:48.710,这酸黄瓜伤胃呀,00:07:48.620,00:07:50.440,Pickled cucumbers damage the Stomach.
00:07:57.920,00:08:00.590,娘娘 您不能这样为难自己啊,00:07:59.040,00:08:01.940,"Your Highness, please don't do this to yourself."
00:08:06.600,00:08:07.710,本宫吐了,00:08:07.660,00:08:09.420,I vomited.
00:08:10.320,00:08:13.430,颂芝 本宫吐了,00:08:11.740,00:08:14.320,"Song Zhi, I vomited."
00:08:13.880,00:08:15.470,你不为本宫高兴吗,00:08:14.860,00:08:16.860,Aren't you happy for me ?
00:08:18.680,00:08:19.740,快去传太医呀,00:08:19.920,00:08:21.660,Summon the imperial doctors!
00:08:23.240,00:08:23.990,娘娘,00:08:24.500,00:08:25.740,Your Highness.
00:08:26.640,00:08:30.790,富察贵人有了 莞贵人也有了,00:08:27.760,00:08:30.000,Lady Fuca was pregnant.
,,,00:08:30.280,00:08:31.900,And Lady Sourire too.
00:08:32.720,00:08:34.470,人人都能生,00:08:33.980,00:08:35.760,They all can carry a child.
00:08:36.080,00:08:38.510,为什么就本宫生不了,00:08:37.280,00:08:39.340,Why can I not?
00:08:41.280,00:08:45.270,娘娘 您还年轻 迟早会有的,00:08:42.680,00:08:46.480,"Your Highness, you are young and it's just a matter of time."
00:08:47.360,00:08:53.390,本宫曾经有过 那是一个男孩,00:08:48.580,00:08:50.440,I was pregnant before.
,,,00:08:52.660,00:08:54.660,I had a boy.
00:08:59.440,00:09:01.190,就是因为她,00:09:01.000,00:09:03.220,It was because of her!
00:09:09.800,00:09:11.390,娘娘吃了药嘴发苦,00:09:10.980,00:09:12.580,The medicine is bitter.
00:09:11.680,00:09:13.790,这碗慧米甜羹润喉凝神,,,
00:09:14.120,00:09:15.710,娘娘吃了便可睡了,00:09:12.640,00:09:16.620,"Having the sweet coix soup after will
soothe your throat and calm your mind."
00:09:16.120,00:09:18.470,华妃娘娘驾到,00:09:17.140,00:09:19.620,Her Highness Consort Fleur.
00:09:20.760,00:09:21.670,华妃娘娘,00:09:21.960,00:09:23.360,Consort Fleur.
00:09:30.320,00:09:32.190,华妃娘娘 端娘娘已经睡下了,00:09:30.600,00:09:33.280,"Your Highness, Consort Honnête has retired for the night."
00:09:32.480,00:09:34.150,您要看望娘娘 请明日再来吧,00:09:33.600,00:09:35.440,Please visit tomorrow if Your Highness wishes to see her.
00:09:34.760,00:09:35.510,起开,00:09:35.900,00:09:37.020,Out of my way!
00:09:39.080,00:09:39.670,嗻,,,
00:09:41.760,00:09:42.510,看好人,00:09:40.300,00:09:41.180,Yes.
00:09:42.680,00:09:43.310,嗻,00:09:42.720,00:09:43.800,Keep her still.
,,,00:09:43.820,00:09:44.580,Aye.
00:09:43.560,00:09:46.350,娘娘 娘娘 娘娘,00:09:44.580,00:09:45.300,Your Highness.
,,,00:09:45.340,00:09:46.300,Your Highness.
,,,00:09:46.380,00:09:47.620,Your Highness.
00:10:03.080,00:10:04.270,多少年了,,,
00:10:05.440,00:10:08.070,你每次发脾气闯到我宫里,00:10:04.100,00:10:06.080,How many years have passed
00:10:09.360,00:10:11.350,都是这样的架势,00:10:06.540,00:10:12.060,and you still storm into my palace like this?
00:10:11.680,00:10:12.900,多少年了,00:10:12.720,00:10:14.380,How many years have passed?
00:10:13.800,00:10:16.180,只要想到我那个未出生的孩子,00:10:14.880,00:10:17.600,"Whenever I think of my unborn child,"
00:10:17.040,00:10:19.270,我就恨不得吃你的肉 喝你的血,00:10:18.140,00:10:21.420,how I wish I could eat your flesh and drink your blood!
00:10:20.920,00:10:24.230,吃我的肉 喝我的血,00:10:22.100,00:10:24.960,Eat my flesh and drink my blood?
00:10:25.480,00:10:28.950,这些年不都是这样的吗,00:10:26.640,00:10:30.240,Isn't that exactly what you've been doing all these years?
00:10:30.120,00:10:33.590,我真恨 恨不能亲手杀了你,00:10:31.300,00:10:32.540,How I wish...
,,,00:10:32.720,00:10:34.840,I wish I could kill you with my own hands!
00:10:40.240,00:10:45.180,我缠绵于病榻 生不如死,00:10:41.160,00:10:43.260,"I am confined to bed by illness,"
,,,00:10:44.620,00:10:46.740,living a life that is no better than death.
00:10:46.440,00:10:50.310,这难道不比杀了我还痛快,00:10:47.500,00:10:51.120,Isn't that better than killing me?
00:10:50.720,00:10:52.350,就算你生不如死,,,
00:10:53.080,00:10:54.710,也补不了我丧子之痛,00:10:51.760,00:10:53.920,"Even if your life is no better than death,"
00:10:56.080,00:10:59.620,皇上登基尊你为妃,00:10:54.220,00:10:57.060,it doesn't ease my pain of losing a child.
00:10:59.960,00:11:02.070,与我平起平坐 还留你一条命,00:10:57.380,00:11:02.960,"His Majesty didn't kill you, and after his coronation
he even promoted you to Consort."
00:11:03.200,00:11:04.340,我怎能不恨,,,
00:11:05.560,00:11:07.510,像你这种狠毒妇人,00:11:04.320,00:11:06.020,How I hate you!
00:11:08.480,00:11:10.430,就应该做成人彘等死,00:11:06.640,00:11:11.400,"How I wish you can be made into a ""human swine"" and die!"
00:11:11.840,00:11:14.270,如果我真的是罪大恶极,00:11:13.040,00:11:16.560,"Had I committed the unpardonable crime that you described,"
00:11:15.720,00:11:19.910,皇上也不会留我苟活至今,00:11:16.960,00:11:21.380,His Majesty wouldn’t have let me live until this day.
00:11:20.760,00:11:22.990,皇上信你 护着你,00:11:21.920,00:11:24.360,His Majesty trusted you and protected you.
00:11:23.720,00:11:25.310,可是我死都不会信,00:11:24.780,00:11:27.320,But I won't believe you even after I die.
00:11:27.080,00:11:29.380,那碗安胎药是你端给我的,00:11:28.220,00:11:30.720,You brought me that bowl of prenatal tonic.
00:11:30.560,00:11:33.790,整个王府里就你与世无争,,,
00:11:34.160,00:11:35.190,我才信你两分,00:11:31.700,00:11:36.600,"You were the only concubine who stayed out of all
the rivalries and that was why I let my guard down."
00:11:35.640,00:11:37.990,可是没想到你这么狠毒,00:11:36.860,00:11:39.580,I never imagined how vicious you were.
00:11:39.160,00:11:41.720,竟下了药打下我的孩子,00:11:40.340,00:11:43.460,That you would poison me to abort my child!
00:11:44.680,00:11:46.270,可怜我的孩子,00:11:45.920,00:11:47.700,My poor child.
00:11:47.600,00:11:50.190,那是个已经成形的男胎,00:11:48.840,00:11:51.440,He was a well formed boy.
00:11:50.640,00:11:52.550,竟活活断送在你的手里,00:11:51.820,00:11:54.440,And you killed him with your own hands!
00:11:55.160,00:11:57.460,当年你不分青红皂白,,,
00:11:57.680,00:12:00.030,把所有的事情都加在我的头上,00:11:56.380,00:12:00.920,You had no evidence and dumped all the blame on me.
00:12:01.760,00:12:03.910,深夜闯进我的阁中,,,
00:12:04.160,00:12:06.230,灌我喝下一壶红花,00:12:03.100,00:12:07.200,"You broke into my chamber and
poured a pot of boiled safflower into my mouth."
00:12:07.000,00:12:08.430,你固然惨死一子,00:12:08.020,00:12:09.460,"Yes, you lost your child."
00:12:08.760,00:12:11.060,可是我却再也不能够生育,00:12:09.500,00:12:12.260,But because of you I will never have children!
00:12:12.680,00:12:14.110,你不能生育又如何,00:12:13.420,00:12:15.060,So what?
00:12:15.080,00:12:17.640,我恨不得你永生永世都断子绝孙,00:12:16.180,00:12:19.740,I hope your entire family will never be able to have children!
00:12:20.920,00:12:22.790,如果你真有铁证,00:12:21.880,00:12:24.520,"If you ever had any evidence,"
00:12:23.920,00:12:26.110,早就把我剉骨扬灰,00:12:25.020,00:12:28.120,"you would have already ""ground my bones and scattered my ashes""."
00:12:28.280,00:12:30.310,何必还站在这里,00:12:29.440,00:12:32.200,There’s no need for wasting your breath standing here...
00:12:32.520,00:12:34.590,只要你在这宫中一日,00:12:33.960,00:12:36.940,"As long as you are still breathing in this palace,"
00:12:35.800,00:12:37.550,我断断不会放过你,00:12:37.220,00:12:39.600,we are not done with this!
00:12:41.360,00:12:46.110,你放不放过我 都无所谓呀,00:12:42.580,00:12:47.120,Why does that even matter?
00:12:48.320,00:12:50.310,我也已经认命了,00:12:49.480,00:12:51.760,I have accepted my destiny.
00:12:51.800,00:12:54.070,我折在你的手里了,00:12:52.820,00:12:55.400,My life has been ruined by your hands.
00:12:55.760,00:12:57.150,天色已晚,00:12:57.040,00:12:58.580,It’s late now.
00:12:57.920,00:13:01.110,惊动了太后也是无益的,00:12:58.920,00:13:02.020,There’s no good in disturbing the Empress Dowager.
00:13:01.440,00:13:02.550,你以为我会怕,00:13:02.460,00:13:05.420,Do you think I am afraid of that?
00:13:06.120,00:13:07.550,你当然会怕,00:13:07.240,00:13:09.220,Of course you are afraid.
00:13:09.120,00:13:10.470,太后知道了,00:13:09.700,00:13:11.800,"If Her Majesty finds out about this,"
00:13:11.240,00:13:13.150,皇上回来也就知道了,00:13:12.440,00:13:15.340,His Majesty will be told when he returns.
00:13:14.920,00:13:18.110,这些年你圣眷不断,00:13:16.140,00:13:19.900,"All these years, you have been continually in His Majesty's favor."
00:13:19.320,00:13:23.790,你最怕的就是失去皇上的宠幸,00:13:20.760,00:13:24.680,What you fear the most is the loss of his favor.
00:13:25.080,00:13:26.430,你今儿这么一闹,,,
00:13:26.920,00:13:28.790,无非就是富察贵人,,,
00:13:29.480,00:13:31.750,还有莞贵人接连怀孕,00:13:26.300,00:13:32.640,You're creating chaos tonight out of spite for Lady Fuca and Lady Sourire.
00:13:32.520,00:13:34.590,你心生忌恨,00:13:33.600,00:13:36.080,You resent them out of jealousy.
00:13:36.400,00:13:38.110,你今天这么一闹,,,
00:13:38.960,00:13:41.030,难道就不怕皇上怀疑,00:13:37.320,00:13:42.320,Aren't you afraid that His Majesty will be suspicious that
00:13:42.040,00:13:43.750,富察贵人小产,,,
00:13:44.600,00:13:47.310,还有莞贵人受伤是你所为,00:13:43.280,00:13:48.420,"you were the one responsible for Lady Fuca's
 miscarriage and Lady Sourire's injury?"
00:13:48.920,00:13:51.950,到时候 你大可以看看,00:13:49.880,00:13:53.320,You are welcome to wait and see
00:13:52.840,00:13:54.630,皇上是以你为重,,,
00:13:56.440,00:13:59.110,还是以皇家子嗣焉重,00:13:53.960,00:14:00.000,whether His Majesty gives priority to you or his children.
00:13:59.960,00:14:01.350,今日之事跟我无关,,,
00:14:01.840,00:14:03.590,有没有关系不重要,00:14:01.040,00:14:02.820,What happened to them has nothing to do with me!
,,,00:14:02.980,00:14:05.480,That does not matter.
00:14:04.960,00:14:07.030,重要的是皇上怎么看,00:14:06.200,00:14:08.760,What matters is His Majesty’s judgement.
00:14:08.040,00:14:11.630,就像你当年认定我杀了你的孩子,00:14:09.140,00:14:13.960,"Just like when you were convinced that I had killed your child,"
00:14:13.520,00:14:15.630,你怎么都不会放过我,,,
00:14:16.600,00:14:18.350,那是一样的道理,00:14:14.720,00:14:19.120,you would not believe the opposite.
00:14:20.360,00:14:21.910,宫中时日长久,00:14:21.440,00:14:23.480,Time passes slowly in the palace.
00:14:22.720,00:14:24.470,你就慢慢在我手里熬吧,00:14:23.840,00:14:25.880,You will stew in your own juice.
00:14:25.920,00:14:30.310,我要看着你苟延残喘 生不如死,00:14:27.060,00:14:32.400,"I will take delight in seeing you ""linger on your
 last breath"" while you wish you could die."
00:14:47.320,00:14:49.350,内务府的封赏一律不许给延庆殿,,,
00:14:49.760,00:14:51.550,例银全部按在太医院头上,00:14:48.620,00:14:50.660,The Household Department will send no money to the Yanqing Hall.
00:14:51.800,00:14:53.270,说是她喝药开销掉的,00:14:50.880,00:14:53.120,All her stipends will be sent to the Imperial Infirmary.
,,,00:14:53.120,00:14:54.800,That's to pay for her medicine.
00:14:54.200,00:14:57.710,还有不许浣衣局给她宫里洗衣服,00:14:55.180,00:14:58.660,"Also, the Palace Laundry is not allowed
to wash clothes for her palace."
00:14:58.080,00:14:59.910,新鲜的吃食也不许给,00:14:59.180,00:15:00.940,No fresh food will be sent to her palace.
00:15:00.400,00:15:01.430,全都不许给,00:15:01.540,00:15:02.620,Nothing!
00:15:02.880,00:15:04.190,娘娘千万不要生气,00:15:03.880,00:15:05.600,Your Highness must not be angry.
00:15:04.480,00:15:06.940,一向都是这样做的 奴婢知道了,00:15:05.620,00:15:08.300,It has always been done like that. Don't worry.
00:15:10.400,00:15:11.910,宫里的太医不中用,,,
00:15:12.760,00:15:14.230,明日派人告诉哥哥,00:15:11.520,00:15:13.520,The imperial doctors are useless.
00:15:15.080,00:15:17.190,太后同意从外面找个大夫来,00:15:13.820,00:15:16.100,Send someone to tell my brother tomorrow
00:15:24.000,00:15:26.590,陈大夫 听说您是青海一带,00:15:16.100,00:15:18.940,that I have Her Majesty's permission to see a doctor from outside.
00:15:26.840,00:15:28.990,最德高望重的杏林圣手了,00:15:25.020,00:15:30.220,"Dr. Chen, I’ve heard that you are
the most eminent doctor across Qinghai."
00:15:29.240,00:15:30.790,做奴才的难得见上,,,
00:15:31.120,00:15:32.390,今儿伺候您一回,,,
00:15:32.720,00:15:34.150,也是积德积福的事,00:15:30.300,00:15:35.260,"What a blessing from Heaven that I have
this opportunity to meet and serve you!"
00:15:34.560,00:15:36.030,公公 您客气了,,,
00:15:36.400,00:15:37.990,青海乃不毛之地,00:15:35.700,00:15:36.900,"Sir, I am flattered."
00:15:38.200,00:15:40.150,老朽是混口饭吃而已,00:15:37.100,00:15:41.400,"In the barren land of Qinghai, my only option
was to take up my family's medical practice."
00:15:40.400,00:15:43.710,哪能和这宫里的太医相比呀,00:15:41.600,00:15:44.640,I can’t hold a candle to the imperial doctors here.
00:15:44.080,00:15:45.910,真是自惭形秽呀,00:15:45.260,00:15:47.060,I am vastly inferior.
00:15:47.120,00:15:48.230,奴才不懂医术,,,
00:15:48.480,00:15:49.950,但是太后娘娘有心,00:15:48.160,00:15:49.400,I know nothing about medicine.
00:15:50.320,00:15:52.230,说陈大夫难得入京一趟,00:15:49.420,00:15:51.380,Her Majesty the Empress Dowager kindly thought
00:15:52.440,00:15:54.710,自然想跟太医们切磋切磋,00:15:51.460,00:15:55.640,"you would want to exchange views with the imperial
doctors since you have travelled all the way to Beijing."
00:15:55.000,00:15:57.230,回去也是造福一方的事,00:15:56.140,00:15:58.580,It would also benefit the people in Qinghai.
00:15:57.640,00:16:01.390,太后娘娘慈心体谅 惠泽万民哪,00:15:58.760,00:16:02.500,Her Majesty’s benevolent consideration is a blessing to thousands.
00:16:01.840,00:16:02.590,请,,,
00:16:02.920,00:16:03.980,好好好,00:16:02.720,00:16:03.960,This way please.
,,,00:16:04.160,00:16:05.560,Thank you.
00:16:15.560,00:16:19.030,陈大夫 听说您要给华妃诊脉,00:16:16.440,00:16:19.920,"Dr. Chen, I’ve heard that you’re here to visit Consort Fleur."
00:16:19.320,00:16:19.870,这是华妃呢,,,
00:16:20.160,00:16:23.630,进宫以来一直的脉案 留给您用,00:16:20.380,00:16:23.480,"These are Her Highness’s medical records
since she entered the palace."
00:16:24.120,00:16:25.750,提供一些个方便嘛,00:16:23.900,00:16:27.160,I hope this will be of help to you.
00:16:28.000,00:16:29.590,多谢院判大人,00:16:29.180,00:16:31.180,"Thank you very much, head doctor."
00:16:30.520,00:16:33.710,华妃娘娘位分尊贵 荣宠万千,,,
00:16:34.160,00:16:35.630,最得皇上宠爱,00:16:31.700,00:16:36.700,"Consort Fleur is a distinguished concubine
and in the highest favor of His Majesty."
00:16:36.160,00:16:39.190,所以呢 太医院对她格外地上心,00:16:36.800,00:16:40.180,"That's why the Imperial Infirmary pays
particular attention to her."
00:16:39.440,00:16:41.510,前后有二＋多人给她诊脉,00:16:40.380,00:16:42.840,More than twenty doctors have visited her for pulse diagnosis.
00:16:41.960,00:16:43.070,且都是国手啊,,,
00:16:43.280,00:16:45.310,是是 临行前,00:16:42.940,00:16:44.460,They are all nationally renowned doctors.
00:16:45.640,00:16:48.310,年大将军也是反复地叮嘱啊,00:16:44.460,00:16:48.840,"Yes, General Nian also repeatedly impressed upon me"
00:16:48.600,00:16:51.350,要老朽慎重给娘娘把脉,00:16:49.000,00:16:52.500,the paramount importance of Her Highness’s diagnosis.
00:16:51.840,00:16:53.910,老朽很不安哪,00:16:52.860,00:16:54.640,I’m really nervous.
00:16:54.200,00:16:54.790,就是,00:16:54.640,00:16:56.060,I can understand.
00:16:55.000,00:16:57.150,幸好事先和太医谈过,00:16:56.060,00:16:58.380,"I'm fortunate to speak with you beforehand, doctor."
00:16:57.360,00:16:59.550,否则也是战战兢兢,00:16:58.500,00:17:00.660,"Otherwise, I would be trembling with fear."
00:17:01.120,00:17:02.100,这就对了,00:17:01.680,00:17:03.140,There you go.
00:17:04.320,00:17:04.910,你在青海,,,
00:17:05.120,00:17:07.110,一直跟在本宫哥哥身边吗,00:17:05.500,00:17:08.040,Have you been serving my brother all along in Qinghai?
00:17:08.000,00:17:08.670,是,,,
00:17:10.000,00:17:10.910,伺候多久了,00:17:08.960,00:17:10.000,Yes.
00:17:12.840,00:17:15.790,从 从大将军到了青海,00:17:11.100,00:17:13.060,For how long?
00:17:16.080,00:17:17.220,一直伺候着,00:17:14.700,00:17:18.380,I've been the General's doctor since he moved to Qinghai.
00:17:18.560,00:17:19.990,青海蛮荒之地,,,
00:17:20.480,00:17:22.070,本宫哥哥身体安康,00:17:19.680,00:17:21.580,Qinghai is an undeveloped land.
00:17:22.360,00:17:23.550,也有你的一份功劳,00:17:21.580,00:17:25.060,You made a contribution to my brother’s good health.
00:17:24.600,00:17:25.430,颂芝,00:17:25.660,00:17:27.400,Song Zhi.
00:17:29.520,00:17:30.470,多谢娘娘,,,
00:17:30.800,00:17:32.790,这一百两银子看着不沉,00:17:30.700,00:17:31.940,I thank Your Highness.
00:17:33.600,00:17:35.710,要是使劲往脑袋上一砸,00:17:31.940,00:17:33.940,A hundred taels of silver does not look heavy.
00:17:36.160,00:17:37.550,也是能砸死人的,00:17:34.680,00:17:38.620,But they can still kill a person if thrown upon his head.
00:17:38.520,00:17:40.550,你若调理得好本宫的身子,,,
00:17:41.200,00:17:43.150,本宫赏你一万两都是少的,00:17:39.620,00:17:44.020,"If you can restore my health, even ten thousand taels
will be an insufficient reward."
00:17:44.200,00:17:45.670,若是调理不好,00:17:45.140,00:17:46.900,"But if you cannot,"
00:17:46.240,00:17:47.950,本宫也赏你一万两,00:17:47.360,00:17:49.520,I will still reward you ten thousand taels ...
00:17:49.440,00:17:51.230,作为你的殓葬之费,00:17:50.640,00:17:52.380,for your funeral.
00:17:51.960,00:17:54.990,娘娘饶命 奴才不敢不尽力,00:17:52.720,00:17:56.740,"I beg Your Highness to spare my life.
I dare not withhold my efforts."
00:17:57.200,00:18:00.590,起来吧 本宫喜欢把话说到前头,00:17:58.140,00:18:01.680,Rise. I like to make things clear in advance.
00:18:01.520,00:18:03.270,你若真是尽心尽力,,,
00:18:04.160,00:18:06.390,本宫自然不会亏待你,00:18:02.760,00:18:07.240,I will certainly give you what you deserve if you do your utmost.
00:18:09.680,00:18:13.070,本宫的身子怎么样 能不能有孕,00:18:10.620,00:18:14.200,How is my health? Am I able to conceive?
00:18:14.040,00:18:15.070,娘娘万安,00:18:15.160,00:18:17.260,Your Highness is in good health.
00:18:17.160,00:18:20.860,既然如此本宫为何一直未能有孕,00:18:18.380,00:18:22.080,"If so, why haven’t I become pregnant again?"
00:18:23.440,00:18:25.230,可是当时落胎受了影响,00:18:24.640,00:18:27.060,Is it because of the miscarriage I had?
00:18:26.000,00:18:28.560,娘娘落胎是几年前的事了,00:18:27.160,00:18:29.780,It has been a few years since the miscarriage.
00:18:29.400,00:18:31.510,照理说已经无虞,00:18:30.520,00:18:32.840,It should no longer have any influence.
00:18:32.040,00:18:34.470,否则太医院那么多太医,,,
00:18:34.760,00:18:36.310,也不会诊断不出来,00:18:33.100,00:18:37.260,"Otherwise, the imperial doctors would have noticed."
00:18:37.360,00:18:40.980,至于受孕一事需要天时人和,00:18:38.420,00:18:41.780,Pregnancy comes from Heaven's blessing and the right effort.
00:18:41.440,00:18:42.950,更需要机缘哪,00:18:42.460,00:18:44.640,"But most importantly, the right time."
00:18:43.680,00:18:45.510,恕奴才多嘴一句,00:18:44.800,00:18:47.100,"I beg Your Highness’s pardon,"
00:18:46.040,00:18:48.600,娘娘是否一直盼望得子,00:18:47.120,00:18:49.580,but has Your Highness been very eager for a conception?
00:18:48.920,00:18:49.710,这个自然,,,
00:18:50.800,00:18:51.710,这就是了,00:18:49.960,00:18:51.280,Of course.
00:18:53.120,00:18:55.030,这事啊 不能太急,00:18:51.780,00:18:52.980,That's it.
00:18:55.840,00:18:57.470,越急越得不来,00:18:54.320,00:18:56.780,Eagerness is not good for a conception.
00:18:57.840,00:18:59.230,娘娘放宽了心,00:18:56.960,00:18:58.520,An eager heart makes it harder.
,,,00:18:58.900,00:19:00.720,"When Your Highness calms your mind,"
00:18:59.800,00:19:02.830,兴许一下就会有了,00:19:01.000,00:19:03.960,it will happen immediately.
00:19:03.480,00:19:04.350,你指的是,00:19:04.500,00:19:05.640,Are you referring to …
00:19:04.560,00:19:08.150,心情 凡事太急 反而不易得,00:19:05.640,00:19:09.140,Mood. You are pushing it away with an eager heart.
00:19:10.560,00:19:13.990,这么说 本宫还能怀上龙胎,00:19:11.680,00:19:14.980,"You mean, I’m still able to carry a child?"
00:19:14.200,00:19:16.990,娘娘福泽深厚 只待时机,00:19:15.120,00:19:18.100,"Your Highness is deeply blessed.
All you need is good timing."
00:19:25.000,00:19:28.070,时机要紧 人为也不能少,00:19:26.000,00:19:29.660,Timing is important but we can't just sit and wait.
00:19:30.000,00:19:31.990,帮本宫配些上好的坐胎药来,00:19:30.800,00:19:33.420,Prescribe me the best medicine.
00:19:32.400,00:19:33.150,是,,,
00:19:34.720,00:19:36.350,这些银子你且收下,00:19:33.420,00:19:34.720,Yes.
00:19:36.760,00:19:38.350,稍后还有两千两银票,00:19:35.880,00:19:37.760,Take those silver ingots with you.
00:19:38.640,00:19:39.510,会送到你府上,00:19:37.800,00:19:41.860,Two thousand taels will be delivered to your residence later.
00:19:41.680,00:19:42.990,多谢娘娘,00:19:42.640,00:19:45.300,I humbly thank Your Highness.
00:19:46.080,00:19:46.910,起来吧,,,
00:19:47.440,00:19:48.350,谢娘娘,00:19:47.300,00:19:48.580,You may raise.
00:19:52.120,00:19:54.190,陈大夫 您这是怎么了,00:19:48.580,00:19:50.140,I thank Your Highness.
00:19:54.760,00:19:56.030,今儿天不热呀,00:19:53.180,00:19:55.880,"Doctor Chen, is everything all right?"
00:19:56.360,00:19:57.990,您怎么进了一趟翊坤宫,00:19:56.000,00:19:57.320,"The weather is not hot today,"
00:19:58.320,00:19:59.270,出这么些汗哪,00:19:57.440,00:20:00.640,"Why are you sweating so much after
visiting the Palace of Earthly Honor?"
00:19:59.640,00:20:01.350,惭愧 惭愧呀,,,
00:20:01.800,00:20:04.030,天子居处 皇家重地,00:20:00.840,00:20:02.900,I am abashed.
00:20:04.520,00:20:07.310,老朽心生敬意呀,00:20:02.900,00:20:07.900,The palace of the imperial family inspires awe in my humble mind.
00:20:07.640,00:20:09.030,陈大夫若不急的话,00:20:08.740,00:20:10.420,"Dr. Chen, if you are not in a rush,"
00:20:09.240,00:20:11.350,再去给太后宫中的姑姑瞧瞧吧,00:20:10.420,00:20:12.420,would you mind checking on a maid who serves the Empress Dowager?
00:20:11.560,00:20:13.510,岂敢岂敢 请公公带路,00:20:12.420,00:20:14.920,"I am flattered to obey. Please lead the way, sir."
00:20:23.320,00:20:26.750,陈大夫 我的病还能治好吗,00:20:24.400,00:20:28.220,"Dr. Chen, can my illness be cured?"
00:20:29.360,00:20:32.390,姑姑身体康健 什么病也没有啊,00:20:30.560,00:20:33.760,"Madam, you are in good health and not sick at all."
00:20:33.080,00:20:35.380,不 我看过太医了,00:20:34.040,00:20:36.760,"No, I've already seen the imperial doctors."
00:20:35.920,00:20:36.870,都说我的病,,,
00:20:37.480,00:20:40.040,要花上好一顿工夫才能治好呢,00:20:36.920,00:20:41.300,They all said it would take a long time for me to be cured.
00:20:42.720,00:20:44.270,如果一个人没病,,,
00:20:44.800,00:20:47.150,身边的人个个都说她有病,00:20:43.780,00:20:48.300,If a person is not ill but everyone around her says she is.
00:20:48.040,00:20:50.710,而就你陈大夫一个人说了实话,,,
00:20:51.320,00:20:52.510,会是怎样的呢,00:20:49.120,00:20:53.480,"What would happen if you are the only one
that speaks the truth, Dr. Chen?"
00:20:53.600,00:20:54.150,那,00:20:54.600,00:20:55.480,I ...
00:20:54.360,00:20:57.070,相反 有一个人明明有病,,,
00:20:57.560,00:20:58.870,却没人敢说,00:20:55.480,00:20:59.800,"On the contrary, if a person is ill
but no one dares to speak of it,"
00:20:59.720,00:21:02.750,而只有你陈大夫察觉了说出来了,00:21:00.960,00:21:03.760,"and only you noticed and spoke out, Dr. Chen,"
00:21:03.120,00:21:04.230,会怎么样呢,00:21:04.160,00:21:05.380,what would happen?
00:21:04.760,00:21:06.670,那我会被认作是疯子,00:21:05.880,00:21:08.180,Then everyone would think I have gone mad.
00:21:08.880,00:21:11.340,是啊 一辈子的名医,,,
00:21:11.720,00:21:13.670,突然被认为是疯子了,00:21:09.060,00:21:14.920,"They would, despite having been a renowned doctor all your life."
00:21:15.160,00:21:17.910,那可是除了老朽,00:21:16.540,00:21:19.020,"But... besides myself,"
00:21:18.280,00:21:19.950,还会有其他的太医,00:21:19.320,00:21:21.280,there would still be other imperial doctors.
00:21:20.320,00:21:22.350,那万一别的大夫说出来呢,00:21:21.420,00:21:23.380,What if they revealed the truth?
00:21:22.560,00:21:25.190,不可能 永远不会,00:21:23.380,00:21:26.600,It is not possible; it will never happen.
00:21:26.360,00:21:30.110,太医院的嘴都长着同一条舌头,00:21:27.500,00:21:31.880,"The entire Imperial Infirmary ""speaks with the same tongue""."
00:21:33.040,00:21:37.230,那 那老朽也是同一条舌头,00:21:34.060,00:21:35.640,Then ...

00:21:51.880,00:21:54.670,皇上 皇上,00:21:53.580,00:21:56.420,Your Majesty.
00:21:58.680,00:21:59.550,你醒了,,,
00:22:01.560,00:22:03.030,皇上什么时候回来的,00:21:59.740,00:22:01.740,You're finally awake.
00:22:03.440,00:22:04.350,臣妾都不知道,00:22:02.480,00:22:04.380,When did Your Majesty come back?
00:22:05.040,00:22:06.070,朕在河南,00:22:04.380,00:22:06.000,I didn't even hear you.
00:22:07.160,00:22:09.390,听说了富察贵人和你的事,00:22:06.120,00:22:10.500,I heard about the incident that befell you and Lady Fuca while I was in Henan.
00:22:10.600,00:22:11.550,记挂得很,,,
00:22:12.840,00:22:14.630,一料理完事情就回来了,00:22:11.700,00:22:13.480,I was very concerned.
00:22:16.520,00:22:17.740,皇上风尘仆仆,00:22:13.800,00:22:16.500,So I came back as soon as things were properly dealt with.
00:22:18.280,00:22:19.910,应该先回养心殿歇息,00:22:17.600,00:22:19.200,Your Majesty has endured a long journey.
,,,00:22:19.200,00:22:21.880,"You should have rested at the Hall of
Mental Cultivation before visiting me."
00:22:21.200,00:22:22.390,朕想来看看你,00:22:22.280,00:22:24.260,I wanted to see how you are.
00:22:25.200,00:22:26.870,富察贵人的孩子没有了,00:22:26.320,00:22:28.360,Lady Fuca had a miscarriage.
00:22:28.880,00:22:30.590,朕又没有了一个孩子,00:22:30.080,00:22:32.180,I've lost another child.
00:22:32.040,00:22:34.070,为什么朕的孩子,00:22:33.220,00:22:34.300,Why ...
00:22:34.400,00:22:35.750,都不能好好地活下来,00:22:34.660,00:22:37.600,Why is it so difficult for my children to survive?
00:22:37.120,00:22:37.990,四郎累了,00:22:38.160,00:22:40.020,"Si Lang, you are tired."
00:22:39.800,00:22:41.830,在臣妾这儿先睡一会儿吧,00:22:40.840,00:22:43.760,You should get some rest here.
00:22:46.440,00:22:47.870,你一定要把孩子生下来,00:22:47.600,00:22:50.280,You must safely give birth to this child.
00:22:49.400,00:22:53.390,朕一定会好好地疼他 爱他,00:22:50.560,00:22:54.100,I will love him and cherish him.
00:22:58.440,00:22:59.950,皇上别这样看着臣妾,00:22:59.340,00:23:01.720,"Your Majesty, don't look at me like that."
00:23:00.920,00:23:03.350,臣妾受伤了 丑得很,00:23:02.020,00:23:04.300,I look so ugly with my wounds.
00:23:07.680,00:23:11.910,不要紧 朕让太医定给你治好,00:23:08.940,00:23:13.440,"Don't worry, I will make sure the imperial doctors heal the wound."
00:23:15.120,00:23:16.590,你的手臂怎么样了,00:23:16.180,00:23:18.920,How about the injury on your arm?
00:23:18.320,00:23:19.110,没事,,,
00:23:19.800,00:23:20.910,你也真是傻,00:23:19.420,00:23:20.800,It's all right.
00:23:22.360,00:23:23.750,就算你没有孩子,00:23:20.940,00:23:22.480,That was silly of you.
00:23:24.040,00:23:25.750,这样扑去救富察贵人,00:23:23.480,00:23:25.260,"Even if you were not pregnant,"
00:23:26.520,00:23:28.630,万一要伤着自己的身子怎么好,00:23:25.260,00:23:29.100,what if you hurt yourself trying to save Lady Fuca?
00:23:29.280,00:23:30.470,臣妾不是救她,00:23:30.240,00:23:31.760,I was not saving her.
00:23:31.720,00:23:34.020,臣妾是救她腹中皇上的骨肉,00:23:32.420,00:23:35.320,I was saving an imperial heir.
00:23:35.440,00:23:36.870,即使她怀着孩子,00:23:36.600,00:23:38.420,"Even though she was carrying an imperial heir,"
00:23:37.920,00:23:41.070,在朕的心中也不能和你相较,00:23:38.520,00:23:42.920,she still cannot compare to you in my heart.
00:23:44.160,00:23:47.830,朕知道 因为华妃的事,00:23:45.340,00:23:47.280,I understand that
00:23:49.080,00:23:52.270,朕让你和你的父亲都受了委屈,00:23:47.820,00:23:53.200,you and your father are upset about what Consort Fleur did.
00:23:53.280,00:23:57.150,你放心 朕不会再叫你伤心了,00:23:54.420,00:23:58.680,Don't worry. I won't let you down again.
00:24:00.400,00:24:02.750,伤不伤心原也由不得人,00:24:01.500,00:24:03.860,It was not something I could control.
00:24:04.560,00:24:06.630,只要皇上有这样的心思也罢了,00:24:05.120,00:24:08.140,I appreciate Your Majesty thinking of me.
00:24:09.000,00:24:11.460,不过你父亲做了言官,00:24:10.300,00:24:13.380,"But since your father has been appointed to be a supervisory official,"
00:24:12.480,00:24:15.310,以后有些事情做起来就更方便了,00:24:13.540,00:24:16.840,now he can rightfully report on anyone's misconduct.
00:24:17.560,00:24:19.070,朕已经告诉皇后,00:24:18.740,00:24:20.580,I have told the Empress that
00:24:20.000,00:24:23.540,敬妃册封之日就晋你为莞嫔,00:24:21.120,00:24:24.840,"you will be promoted to Concubine on
the day of Consort Estime's promotion."
00:24:24.800,00:24:28.310,朕不会让你再受别人的委屈,00:24:26.000,00:24:29.140,I won't let you suffer any more injustices.
00:24:29.240,00:24:30.270,臣妾不委屈,00:24:30.220,00:24:32.440,I don't feel there was an injustice.
00:24:32.960,00:24:34.750,等所有的事情都了结了,00:24:34.080,00:24:36.260,"When all of this is settled,"
00:24:36.120,00:24:37.710,咱们的孩子也就出世了,00:24:37.240,00:24:39.380,our child will be born.
00:24:39.240,00:24:41.230,朕会晋你为妃,00:24:40.440,00:24:42.640,I will then promote you to Consort
00:24:42.040,00:24:44.310,再建一个新殿给你居住,00:24:43.260,00:24:45.660,and build a new palace for you.
00:24:45.520,00:24:47.110,碎玉轩已经很好了,00:24:46.400,00:24:48.640,The Palace of Pearl Jade is good for me.
00:24:47.600,00:24:49.270,臣妾也不稀罕什么妃位,00:24:48.840,00:24:50.680,And I do not care about the titles.
00:24:51.320,00:24:52.990,只要这样平安地过下去,00:24:52.440,00:24:54.655,I just want a peaceful life
00:24:53.960,00:24:56.390,和皇上 和孩子一起,00:24:54.980,00:24:57.600,with Your Majesty and our child.
00:25:00.680,00:25:01.310,绘春,,,
00:25:01.760,00:25:02.630,苏公公来了,00:25:01.760,00:25:03.840,"- Spring.
- Mr.Su."
00:25:03.440,00:25:04.750,苏公公是来传旨的吗,,,
00:25:05.360,00:25:06.470,还没有到黄昏啊,00:25:04.540,00:25:05.960,"Are you here to deliver the decree, sir?"
00:25:08.080,00:25:08.910,娘娘在吗,00:25:06.480,00:25:07.780,It's not dusk yet.
00:25:09.440,00:25:11.310,在里头呢 奴婢这就去通传,00:25:09.200,00:25:10.460,Is Her Majesty inside?
00:25:11.920,00:25:12.710,有劳了,00:25:10.560,00:25:12.540,"Yes, I'll go inform Her Majesty."
,,,00:25:13.280,00:25:14.680,Thank you.
00:25:18.320,00:25:20.030,娘娘 苏公公来了,00:25:19.520,00:25:21.380,"Your Majesty, Mr. Su is here."
00:25:21.400,00:25:23.590,方才还说皇上回宫,00:25:22.600,00:25:23.900,We were just saying
00:25:23.880,00:25:25.470,只去了碎玉轩和翊坤宫,00:25:23.900,00:25:26.800,His Majesty visited only the Palaces of Earthly Honor and Pearl Jade after returning.
00:25:26.080,00:25:27.590,原来皇上还是惦记着,,,
00:25:28.000,00:25:29.270,来陪皇后娘娘的,00:25:27.000,00:25:30.380,"It turns out His Majesty was intending to
visit and stay with Your Majesty."
00:25:29.800,00:25:31.430,今儿是＋五月圆之夜,,,
00:25:31.760,00:25:33.230,皇上定是想着娘娘,00:25:30.880,00:25:32.680,"Today is the 15th, night of full moon."
00:25:33.440,00:25:35.390,所以急着让苏公公来宣旨,00:25:32.920,00:25:36.320,"His Majesty must be thinking of Your Majesty
so he sent Mr. Su here early."
00:25:35.560,00:25:38.190,越发贪嘴了 快点请他进来吧,00:25:36.540,00:25:39.120,That's enough. Show him in.
00:25:38.480,00:25:39.150,在,,,
00:25:41.240,00:25:42.220,苏公公有请,00:25:39.580,00:25:40.740,Yes.
00:25:45.920,00:25:47.140,皇后娘娘吉祥,00:25:42.340,00:25:44.460,"Please come in, Mr. Su."
00:25:47.520,00:25:48.350,起来吧,00:25:47.000,00:25:48.440,Peace to Your Majesty.
,,,00:25:48.500,00:25:49.860,You may rise.
00:25:49.120,00:25:52.070,皇上这个时候叫你过来可是有事,00:25:50.160,00:25:52.880,Why has His Majesty sent you over?
00:25:52.480,00:25:54.070,皇上叫奴才来传旨,00:25:53.680,00:25:55.600,His Majesty wishes to inform Your Majesty that
00:25:54.560,00:25:57.710,说皇上今儿个 不到景仁宫来了,00:25:55.780,00:25:58.980,he will not come to the Palace of Great Benevolence today.
00:25:59.920,00:26:00.900,每月十五,00:26:01.000,00:26:02.220,"On the fifteenth of each month,"
00:26:01.160,00:26:03.620,必定是皇上会来皇后宫中的日子,00:26:02.240,00:26:04.840,His Majesty always visits Her Majesty.
00:26:04.560,00:26:06.190,今儿是怎么了,00:26:05.640,00:26:07.680,What's going on today?
00:26:07.400,00:26:09.990,是华妃请皇上去用晚膳了,00:26:08.460,00:26:11.000,Did Consort Fleur invite His Majesty for dinner?
00:26:10.400,00:26:12.270,还是皇上身体不适了,,,
00:26:12.760,00:26:14.750,皇上说莞贵人才有孕,00:26:11.420,00:26:13.600,Or he is feeling unwell?
00:26:15.160,00:26:16.590,所以处理完政务,00:26:13.940,00:26:16.260,"His Majesty said since Lady Sourire just got pregnant,"
00:26:17.200,00:26:19.230,就赶去看莞贵人了,00:26:16.440,00:26:20.360,he went to visit her immediately after finishing with state affairs.
00:26:19.760,00:26:21.670,请皇后娘娘早些歇息,00:26:20.880,00:26:22.780,Your Majesty can rest early tonight.
00:26:22.600,00:26:23.820,那也是应当的,00:26:23.320,00:26:24.640,Certainly.
00:26:24.920,00:26:28.460,莞贵人温柔聪慧 最善体察圣心,00:26:26.160,00:26:27.780,Lady Sourire is smart and sweet-natured.
,,,00:26:28.080,00:26:29.660,She always understands His Majesty's heart.
00:26:28.800,00:26:30.990,皇上多陪陪她也是应当的,00:26:29.880,00:26:32.320,His Majesty should spend more time with her.
00:26:32.960,00:26:33.710,绘春,00:26:34.080,00:26:35.460,Spring.
00:26:36.120,00:26:36.750,在,00:26:37.320,00:26:38.180,Yes.
00:26:37.320,00:26:40.430,等下去库房选两柄和田玉如意,00:26:38.400,00:26:41.360,Select a pair of Hetian jade ruyi from the storehouse
00:26:40.880,00:26:42.470,送给莞贵人安枕吧,00:26:41.600,00:26:43.780,to place on Lady Sourire pillows to wish her good sleep.
00:26:42.760,00:26:43.510,是,00:26:43.940,00:26:45.100,Yes.
00:26:45.040,00:26:47.870,娘娘 那奴才先告退了,00:26:45.800,00:26:48.860,"Allow me to take my leave, Your Majesty."
00:26:48.520,00:26:49.430,去吧,00:26:49.640,00:26:51.060,You may go.
00:27:01.800,00:27:02.780,天色还早,00:27:03.060,00:27:04.680,It's still early.
00:27:04.240,00:27:07.430,皇上去皇后娘娘宫里歇息吧,00:27:05.200,00:27:08.140,Your Majesty should rest in the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:27:08.200,00:27:09.030,不要紧,,,
00:27:11.560,00:27:13.190,皇上不该陪着臣妾,00:27:09.420,00:27:10.940,It's all right.
00:27:13.800,00:27:15.670,而误了与娘娘的月圆之夜,00:27:12.760,00:27:17.320,"Your Majesty should not miss the night of
full moon with Her Majesty because of me."
00:27:17.400,00:27:19.990,朕想和自己喜欢的人在一起,00:27:18.600,00:27:20.720,I want to stay where my heart is
00:27:20.320,00:27:21.230,不管什么时候,00:27:21.320,00:27:22.740,on any night.
00:27:22.400,00:27:24.070,可是皇后待臣妾不薄,00:27:23.460,00:27:25.840,But Her Majesty has always been good to me.
00:27:25.200,00:27:27.150,臣妾不愿让皇后娘娘伤心,00:27:26.460,00:27:28.740,I don't want to make Her Majesty upset.
00:27:29.520,00:27:34.380,好吧 那朕明日陪皇后用膳,00:27:30.840,00:27:35.780,All right then. I'll have breakfast with her tomorrow.
00:28:16.440,00:28:17.230,皇上,00:28:17.680,00:28:19.360,Your Majesty.
00:28:25.800,00:28:26.510,酸,00:28:26.960,00:28:28.360,It's sour.
00:28:27.480,00:28:29.470,臣妾没试过 不知道是酸的,00:28:28.580,00:28:30.400,"Sorry, I hadn't tasted it. I didn't know it was sour."
00:28:29.760,00:28:30.670,皇上还是别吃了,00:28:30.620,00:28:31.940,Your Majesty shouldn't have more.
00:28:31.120,00:28:33.710,酸得厉害 先别着急扔了,00:28:32.180,00:28:34.840,"It's very sour. But, don't discard it."
00:28:34.560,00:28:35.750,给莞贵人送去,00:28:35.640,00:28:37.400,Send them to Lady Sourire.
00:28:36.440,00:28:38.740,她现在改了胃口 最爱吃酸的,00:28:37.400,00:28:39.900,Her appetite has changed. She loves sour food now.
00:28:40.560,00:28:43.630,酸儿辣女 是好兆头啊,00:28:41.600,00:28:44.380,An appetite for sour food signifies it's a boy.
00:28:43.880,00:28:45.020,富察贵人的胎没了,,,
00:28:45.720,00:28:47.230,莞贵人才刚有了孕,00:28:44.900,00:28:46.580,Lady Fuca has lost her child.
,,,00:28:46.880,00:28:48.880,And Lady Sourire just got pregnant.
00:28:48.520,00:28:50.390,皇后一定要小心照顾,00:28:49.740,00:28:51.620,You must take good care of them.
00:28:50.840,00:28:51.870,这是自然的,00:28:51.920,00:28:53.040,Certainly.
00:28:52.280,00:28:55.190,莞贵人是头一胎 还要格外小心,00:28:53.440,00:28:56.560,"It's Lady Sourire's first time being pregnant.
She must be taken special care of."
00:28:55.760,00:28:59.830,一定要小心着 别像纯元一样,00:28:56.940,00:29:01.280,That's for sure. She can't be like Empress Première.
00:29:02.880,00:29:03.910,姐姐命苦,00:29:04.000,00:29:05.340,My sister had a tragic fate.
00:29:04.280,00:29:06.190,臣妾不会让历史重演了,00:29:05.340,00:29:07.320,I won't let history repeat itself.
00:29:06.840,00:29:10.230,朕倒觉着既要细心照顾,00:29:07.920,00:29:10.960,"You should not only take good care of her,"
00:29:11.440,00:29:13.110,也要防患于未然,00:29:12.520,00:29:14.480,but also take precautions.
00:29:14.360,00:29:15.950,这次富察贵人的事,,,
00:29:16.200,00:29:17.470,是臣妾不够小心,00:29:15.580,00:29:17.200,What happened to Lady Fuca ...
,,,00:29:17.300,00:29:19.080,It was my lack of care.
00:29:18.800,00:29:21.390,要小心防范 尽量避免,00:29:19.960,00:29:22.280,You must do all you can to prevent that.
00:29:22.040,00:29:24.910,记着 以后宫里不许养猫了,00:29:23.180,00:29:26.160,"Remember, cats are no longer allowed in the palace."
00:29:25.360,00:29:26.110,是的,00:29:26.400,00:29:27.280,Yes.
00:29:26.320,00:29:28.590,另外 册封莞贵人的事,,,
00:29:28.840,00:29:30.630,要好好办起来 冲冲喜,00:29:27.280,00:29:30.460,"Also, Lady Sourire's promotion
ceremony must be carefully prepared."
00:29:31.560,00:29:32.670,臣妾知道了,00:29:30.960,00:29:32.740,It will dispel the bad luck in the palace.
,,,00:29:32.740,00:29:34.160,I understand.
00:29:36.600,00:29:39.670,皇后 后日就是册封的日子了,00:29:37.600,00:29:40.680,Her promotion ceremony will take place in two days.
00:29:40.040,00:29:41.260,准备得怎么样啊,00:29:40.920,00:29:43.060,Is everything ready?
00:29:42.240,00:29:44.540,莞贵人也算是个正经主子,00:29:43.360,00:29:45.400,Lady Sourire is now a proper concubine.
00:29:44.880,00:29:46.590,是要行册封之礼的,,,
00:29:48.040,00:29:49.990,只是日子有些紧凑,00:29:46.080,00:29:48.460,and will have a formal ceremony.
00:29:50.640,00:29:51.990,未免有些仓促,00:29:49.220,00:29:53.240,"If only we had a few more days to
adequately prepare for her promotion."
00:29:54.560,00:29:55.700,臣妾不敢妄求,00:29:55.700,00:29:57.320,I need nothing more.
00:29:56.200,00:29:58.580,一切全凭太后 皇后做主,00:29:57.320,00:29:59.640,I will entirely obey Your Majesties.
00:29:59.680,00:30:00.590,你且坐着,00:30:00.800,00:30:02.000,You don't have to stand.
00:30:01.040,00:30:03.110,哀家知道你是个懂事的,00:30:02.160,00:30:04.400,I know you are always thoughtful.
00:30:05.520,00:30:07.030,只是虽然仓促,00:30:06.560,00:30:08.420,"Even though we don't have more time for the preparation,"
00:30:07.520,00:30:09.390,这礼数是不能失的,00:30:08.660,00:30:10.420,we have to follow the proper procedure.
00:30:09.680,00:30:12.270,皇额娘放心 臣妾已经准备妥当,00:30:10.820,00:30:13.380,"Don't worry, Imperial Mother.
I have taken care of everything."
00:30:13.080,00:30:15.350,只是莞贵人册封当日的吉服,,,
00:30:15.680,00:30:16.630,来不及赶制,00:30:14.120,00:30:17.460,But a new ceremonial robe could not be made in the limited time.
00:30:17.240,00:30:18.590,臣妾便让礼部,,,
00:30:18.800,00:30:21.830,拿敬妃封嫔时的吉服改制了,00:30:18.440,00:30:23.420,"So I asked the Ministry of Rites to alter the robe that
Consort Estime used for her Concubinary Ceremony."
00:30:24.000,00:30:26.630,事从权宜 又不失礼数,00:30:25.140,00:30:28.220,That's an expedient solution and yet appropriate.
00:30:28.000,00:30:29.790,皇后 你做得好,00:30:29.240,00:30:31.560,You've done well.
00:30:32.920,00:30:33.590,春貌,,,
00:30:33.920,00:30:34.550,在,00:30:33.840,00:30:35.120,Spring-bloom.
,,,00:30:35.180,00:30:36.220,Yes.
00:30:44.480,00:30:46.780,这支簪子好眼熟啊,00:30:45.540,00:30:47.700,That hairpin looks so familiar.
00:30:47.040,00:30:49.230,好像是从前惠贵人怀孕时,,,
00:30:49.520,00:30:50.950,皇额娘所赐的那支,00:30:48.040,00:30:51.740,"It looks like the one Your Majesty
awarded Lady Vertu when she was pregnant."
00:30:51.240,00:30:52.380,你的眼力真好,00:30:52.040,00:30:54.060,You have such sharp eyes.
00:30:53.280,00:30:55.950,当日皇帝一怒之下掷了出去,00:30:54.440,00:30:57.480,The Emperor was angry and tossed this hairpin onto the floor.
00:30:56.720,00:30:58.630,替子一角摔坏了,00:30:57.840,00:30:59.840,The hairpin was damaged at the top.
00:30:59.280,00:31:01.740,如今已经用宝石镶好了,00:31:00.440,00:31:02.940,I have had it repaired with a ruby.
00:31:02.840,00:31:05.750,哀家就把这赤金合和如意簪,00:31:03.900,00:31:07.800,The design is of the Two Gods of Harmony. I wish for you to have it.
00:31:06.040,00:31:06.910,赐与你,,,
00:31:08.240,00:31:08.910,你过来,00:31:09.360,00:31:10.620,Come here.
00:31:15.840,00:31:16.870,果然好看,00:31:16.860,00:31:18.780,It looks very good on you.
00:31:18.280,00:31:20.840,惠贵人无福戴上这支簪子,00:31:19.480,00:31:22.400,"Sadly Noble Lady Vertu did not
have Heaven's blessing to wear it."
00:31:21.520,00:31:22.950,你要好好积福,00:31:22.620,00:31:24.340,May you accumulate Heaven's blessings
00:31:23.320,00:31:26.030,为皇帝多添皇子才是,00:31:24.360,00:31:27.360,and carry more children for the Emperor.
00:31:29.760,00:31:30.950,多谢太后赏赐,00:31:30.960,00:31:33.000,I thank Your Majesty.
00:31:35.280,00:31:36.070,这是什么呀,00:31:36.280,00:31:38.100,What are these?
00:31:38.480,00:31:40.670,这个都是皇上刚派人送来的,00:31:39.340,00:31:41.540,They were sent by His Majesty.
00:31:41.520,00:31:43.750,这个呢 是玉露琼脂膏,00:31:42.660,00:31:44.980,This is the Jade Dew Salve.
00:31:44.160,00:31:45.790,听说祛疤效果最好了,00:31:45.360,00:31:47.900,It's said to be the most effective for scar removal.
00:31:48.320,00:31:50.620,这个呢 是复颜如玉粉,00:31:48.760,00:31:51.480,This is the Jade Repair Powder.
00:31:50.920,00:31:51.830,凝结血痕的,00:31:51.960,00:31:53.560,To reduce the redness.
00:31:53.440,00:31:55.670,这样的药皇上赐了许多呢,00:31:54.160,00:31:57.400,His Majesty has also awarded other medicine like these.
00:32:02.920,00:32:05.150,猫这一爪抓得并不深,00:32:04.020,00:32:06.700,The scratch was not deep.
00:32:05.720,00:32:07.630,可看着总是触目惊心,00:32:06.900,00:32:09.500,But it's still dreadful to look at.
00:32:09.280,00:32:10.070,从今儿起,,,
00:32:10.680,00:32:12.670,小主万事可要格外小心,00:32:10.340,00:32:13.740,"From now on, you have to be
extra careful about everything, My Lady."
00:32:13.440,00:32:14.580,饮食方面的事呢,,,
00:32:14.840,00:32:16.630,奴婢会格外为您照看的,00:32:14.500,00:32:17.780,I will also pay special attention to your food.
00:32:17.800,00:32:19.430,皇上也已经从御膳房,,,
00:32:19.680,00:32:20.790,拨了一个御厨来,,,
00:32:21.080,00:32:22.590,专门照看小主的饮食,00:32:18.400,00:32:23.520,"His Majesty has also sent a cook from the
Imperial Kitchen to prepare all your food."
00:32:22.880,00:32:23.790,旁人不得插手,,,
00:32:24.320,00:32:25.430,小主吃的药呢,00:32:23.820,00:32:25.300,No one else can lay a finger on it.
00:32:25.680,00:32:28.140,今后由章太医专门为小主打点,00:32:25.460,00:32:28.200,Dr. Zhang will be responsible for your medication.
00:32:28.600,00:32:29.910,章太医为人老成,,,
00:32:30.240,00:32:31.990,想必不会有什么差错,00:32:28.500,00:32:33.580,"He is an experienced and respected doctor.
I do not believe he will make any mistakes."
00:32:37.480,00:32:39.430,小主 安常在来了,00:32:38.640,00:32:40.940,"My Lady, Attendant An is here."
00:32:40.040,00:32:40.750,快请进来,,,
00:32:41.000,00:32:41.590,嗻,00:32:41.060,00:32:42.040,Show her in please.
,,,00:32:42.180,00:32:43.080,Yes.
00:32:48.480,00:32:49.230,姐姐,00:32:49.520,00:32:50.960,Sourire.
00:32:52.600,00:32:53.580,惊着姐姐了,,,
00:32:54.080,00:32:55.060,陵容这个样子,00:32:53.560,00:32:54.960,I hope my voice does not startle you.
00:32:55.360,00:32:56.710,实在是不应该出门的,00:32:55.140,00:32:57.840,I know I shouldn't go out when I'm sick.
00:32:57.560,00:32:58.910,怎么嗓子成这样了,00:32:58.500,00:33:00.500,What happened to your voice?
00:33:00.880,00:33:01.590,快坐,,,
00:33:02.560,00:33:03.910,咳疾总是不见好,00:33:01.820,00:33:03.100,Have a seat.
00:33:04.680,00:33:05.950,有些伤到嗓子了,00:33:03.540,00:33:07.080,My cough hasn't gotten better. My voice is affected.
00:33:09.960,00:33:11.230,什么糊涂太医,,,
00:33:11.520,00:33:12.580,怎么也不好好治呢,00:33:10.900,00:33:12.400,Why are the doctors so useless?
00:33:13.280,00:33:14.670,是我自己身子弱,00:33:12.540,00:33:13.880,Why didn't they treat you carefully?
00:33:14.920,00:33:16.350,太医才不敢下重了药,00:33:14.400,00:33:17.620,"The doctors wouldn't prescribe strong
medication because of my fragile health."
00:33:17.120,00:33:19.630,那日我强撑着去陪皇后娘娘赏花,00:33:18.220,00:33:20.560,I managed to accompany Her Majesty to appreciate the flowers that day.
00:33:19.960,00:33:22.230,结果因为富察贵人的事受了惊吓,00:33:21.020,00:33:23.260,I was shocked by what happened to Lady Fuca.
00:33:22.920,00:33:24.060,加重了风寒,00:33:24.060,00:33:25.480,The stress also aggravated my condition.
00:33:24.480,00:33:27.040,所以这些日子都没能来看姐姐,,,
00:33:27.320,00:33:28.270,恭贺姐姐大喜,00:33:25.600,00:33:29.420,That's why I couldn't come earlier to congratulate you.
00:33:29.120,00:33:30.070,这些都是小事,,,
00:33:30.480,00:33:31.830,你自己的身子要紧,00:33:30.040,00:33:32.780,That is nothing compared to your health.
00:33:32.600,00:33:33.510,皇上可知道了,00:33:33.680,00:33:35.360,Is His Majesty aware?
00:33:35.720,00:33:36.780,回宫之后,,,
00:33:37.040,00:33:38.830,皇上倒是召我去过养心殿,00:33:36.640,00:33:40.160,I was summoned once to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:33:40.080,00:33:42.030,可惜我自己不能唱出声来,00:33:41.120,00:33:42.960,But I couldn't sing.
00:33:42.720,00:33:44.590,皇上便嘱咐我好生休养,00:33:43.900,00:33:45.900,His Majesty told me to have a good rest.
00:33:45.440,00:33:48.110,之后 就再没召幸过我了,00:33:46.580,00:33:49.100,Since then I haven't see him again.
00:33:50.320,00:33:51.510,什么时候的事啊,,,
00:33:52.160,00:33:53.190,我竟然都不知道,00:33:51.440,00:33:52.940,I didn't know.
00:33:54.200,00:33:55.590,不是什么光彩的事,00:33:53.140,00:33:54.740,When did that happen?.
00:33:55.840,00:33:57.190,何必人人都知道呢,00:33:55.260,00:33:58.020,It's not something that I would want people to know.
00:34:00.320,00:34:03.190,光顾着说 我倒让姐姐伤心了,00:34:01.420,00:34:04.280,I talked too much. I made you feel bad.
00:34:03.440,00:34:04.750,竟忘了今日的来意,00:34:04.460,00:34:06.280,It's not the reason for my visit.
00:34:05.840,00:34:07.310,姐姐的伤可好些了吗,00:34:06.880,00:34:08.840,Has your wound got better?
00:34:08.560,00:34:09.590,已经在愈合了,,,
00:34:10.320,00:34:11.270,太医看过了,00:34:09.640,00:34:11.260,It is healing.
00:34:11.560,00:34:12.870,皇上也赐了药下来,00:34:11.340,00:34:12.660,The doctors have seen it.
00:34:13.280,00:34:14.630,想来养几日就好了,00:34:12.660,00:34:14.040,And His Majesty granted some medicine.
00:34:16.720,00:34:18.310,皇上赐的药倒是好的,00:34:14.420,00:34:16.360,I think I'll be fine after a few days.
00:34:19.080,00:34:20.990,只是姐姐有了身孕,00:34:17.820,00:34:19.900,The medicines from His Majesty are good.
00:34:21.400,00:34:23.070,可不能随便什么药都用,00:34:20.140,00:34:24.080,But certain herbs can't be used when you are pregnant.
00:34:23.800,00:34:25.990,再者皇上赏的这些药,,,
00:34:26.280,00:34:27.500,大多都是外头进贡的,00:34:24.900,00:34:28.500,"Also, most of these medications are probably tributary offerings."
00:34:27.880,00:34:29.350,也未必合咱们的体质,,,
00:34:29.720,00:34:30.830,姐姐 你说是不是,00:34:28.940,00:34:31.720,They might not be suitable for your constitution.
00:34:31.360,00:34:32.340,你说得也有理,00:34:32.280,00:34:33.620,You are right.
00:34:34.560,00:34:40.510,对了 这盒舒痕胶是陵容家传的,00:34:35.680,00:34:36.960,Here.
00:34:41.320,00:34:42.230,据说当年,00:34:39.260,00:34:41.900,I have this Scar Relief Gel which is a family formula.
00:34:42.480,00:34:44.150,吴主孙和的爱妃邓夫人,00:34:42.260,00:34:43.720,The formula was said to have cured
00:34:44.560,00:34:45.510,被玉如意伤了脸,00:34:43.720,00:34:47.540,"King Sun He's beloved consort Lady Deng
when she was hurt by a jade ruyi."
00:34:45.920,00:34:46.950,就是以此复原的,,,
00:34:47.760,00:34:49.950,这舒痕胶中的桃花和珍珠粉,,,
00:34:50.360,00:34:51.270,令人好颜色,00:34:48.680,00:34:52.140,"It contains peach blossoms and pearl
power to brighten your complexion."
00:34:51.760,00:34:54.950,鱼骨胶 蜂蜜可以使肌肤光滑,00:34:52.840,00:34:55.920,Fish bone gelatin and honey smooth your skin.
00:34:55.640,00:34:58.230,玉屑和琥珀都是愈合伤口,,,
00:34:58.640,00:34:59.750,平复疤痕的,00:34:56.640,00:35:00.620,"Fine powders of jade and amber can
heal the wound and remove the scar."
00:35:00.240,00:35:02.800,尤为珍贵的是白獭髓了,00:35:01.400,00:35:03.600,The most precious ingredient is the white otter marrow.
00:35:03.240,00:35:05.620,可以使疤痕退色 光复如新,00:35:04.240,00:35:06.620,It fades the scar and restores your skin to pristine condition.
00:35:06.000,00:35:07.060,其他的也就罢了,,,
00:35:07.680,00:35:09.550,这白獭髓是极难得的,00:35:06.980,00:35:09.500,The white otter marrow is terribly rare.
00:35:10.280,00:35:11.630,恐怕宫中也很少有,00:35:09.800,00:35:12.820,I doubt there is much of it even here in the palace .
00:35:12.280,00:35:13.030,是啊,00:35:13.320,00:35:14.280,That's right.
00:35:13.280,00:35:15.740,白獭一般只在富春江一带出产,00:35:14.360,00:35:16.820,The white otters are found along the Fuchun River.
00:35:16.240,00:35:19.150,偶尔死后有碎骨藏于石穴之中,,,
00:35:19.440,00:35:21.030,才能取出一些骨髓来,00:35:17.360,00:35:22.040,"The marrow is usually extracted from the
rarely-found bone remains of dead white otters."
00:35:22.880,00:35:24.910,最好还是得趁新鲜的时候,00:35:23.620,00:35:25.840,It is best when the marrow is fresh.
00:35:25.360,00:35:27.230,否则的话即便有用,,,
00:35:27.560,00:35:29.270,效力也远远不及新鲜的了,00:35:26.380,00:35:30.140,"Otherwise, the medicinal effect is greatly reduced."
00:35:29.600,00:35:30.390,好香啊,,,
00:35:30.760,00:35:32.790,本想用香料调和气味的,00:35:30.540,00:35:31.760,It smells so good.
00:35:33.280,00:35:34.990,又想着姐姐是有身子的人,00:35:31.840,00:35:34.100,I would usually perfume it with spices.
00:35:35.360,00:35:36.190,忌用香料,00:35:34.460,00:35:37.420,But I thought they would not be good for you when you are pregnant.
00:35:36.560,00:35:39.020,所以我就用了鲜花调和气味,00:35:37.660,00:35:39.860,So I used fresh flowers instead.
00:35:39.320,00:35:40.030,这样的话,,,
00:35:40.280,00:35:42.030,姐姐闻着也不觉得有药气了,00:35:40.240,00:35:43.140,This way it does not smell like medicine.
00:35:43.440,00:35:47.310,好是极好的 只是太名贵了,00:35:44.480,00:35:48.280,This is extremely good medicine but too costly.
00:35:47.680,00:35:48.630,我怎么好收呢,00:35:48.720,00:35:50.160,I shouldn't accept it.
00:35:49.480,00:35:51.780,我的东西便是姐姐的东西,00:35:50.560,00:35:53.040,"Whatever I have is yours, Sourire."
00:35:52.880,00:35:55.550,姐姐的伤口好了 我便心安了,00:35:53.820,00:35:56.600,I'll feel relieved to see your wound healed.
00:35:56.680,00:35:59.030,另外 姐姐那里有伤,00:35:57.800,00:36:00.160,"Besides, in the springtime,"
00:35:59.760,00:36:03.070,如今春日里 花粉大 灰尘多,00:36:00.740,00:36:04.040,there is more dust and pollen in the air
00:36:03.600,00:36:05.950,若不当心沾上了 反而是不利,00:36:04.720,00:36:06.920,which can negatively affect your wound.
00:36:06.640,00:36:09.990,再者这舒痕胶抹上之后也忌吹风,00:36:07.540,00:36:10.060,The gel should not be exposed to wind.
00:36:10.560,00:36:11.950,姐姐若是出门的话,,,
00:36:12.280,00:36:14.070,可得把伤口好好遮住了,00:36:10.060,00:36:14.980,You must cover the wound if you go out.
00:36:15.120,00:36:16.100,你这样细心,,,
00:36:17.080,00:36:18.510,我都不知道怎么谢你了,00:36:16.140,00:36:18.020,That's very considerate of you.
,,,00:36:18.180,00:36:20.320,Words cannot describe how grateful I am.
00:36:23.200,00:36:23.990,尝尝这个,00:36:23.900,00:36:25.840,Try this.
00:36:28.720,00:36:30.510,听说姐姐临盆的时候,,,
00:36:30.960,00:36:33.340,娘家的母亲就可以进宫来陪着,00:36:29.680,00:36:34.580,"I hear that your mother can visit you
and accompany you during childbirth."
00:36:33.600,00:36:34.390,是真的吗,00:36:34.660,00:36:35.660,Is that true?
00:36:34.640,00:36:37.390,是啊 到了八个月的时候,,,
00:36:37.760,00:36:38.950,皇上就有恩旨了,00:36:35.660,00:36:40.740,"Yes,  His Majesty will grant her permission to come
to the palace when I'm eight months pregnant."
00:36:43.600,00:36:45.590,你整日里笑呵呵的没什么心事,00:36:44.700,00:36:46.880,You are always cheery day and night;
00:36:46.000,00:36:47.910,怎么突然学会叹气了,00:36:47.140,00:36:49.360,when did you start to sigh?
00:36:48.600,00:36:50.630,我好久都没有见到娘亲了,00:36:49.700,00:36:52.400,I haven't seen my mother for so long.
00:36:52.760,00:36:55.270,姐姐倒好 等肚子里娃娃大了,,,
00:36:55.680,00:36:56.950,就能见到母亲了,00:36:53.940,00:36:58.320,"You are so lucky, Sourire. You can see
your mother when the baby is bigger."
00:36:57.680,00:37:00.830,你比我小两岁 在家里又是幼女,00:36:58.840,00:37:02.200,"You are two years younger than me
and the youngest child in your family."
00:37:01.520,00:37:03.870,进宫至今都未见过家里人一面,00:37:02.700,00:37:05.040,And you haven't seen your family ever since you moved into the palace.
00:37:04.240,00:37:05.270,可不是要想家了,00:37:05.320,00:37:07.340,You must miss them so much.
00:37:08.240,00:37:10.950,没事的 小主在宫中过得好,,,
00:37:11.400,00:37:14.030,那夫人在府中岂不是高兴啊,00:37:09.440,00:37:14.920,"It's all right, Attendant Chun. Your family will be happy
knowing your life in the palace is good."
00:37:14.920,00:37:17.220,再说了 咱们宫中的吃食,,,
00:37:17.560,00:37:18.910,那外面哪能比得了呢,00:37:16.100,00:37:20.200,"Besides, the food outside cannot compare to what we have here."
00:37:21.560,00:37:23.790,这是现蒸的牛乳菱粉香糕,00:37:22.800,00:37:24.860,These are freshly made milk and water caltrop cakes.
00:37:24.040,00:37:25.180,热腾腾的最好吃了,00:37:25.120,00:37:27.380,It tastes the best when it's just out of the steamer.
00:37:30.640,00:37:31.510,好吃,00:37:31.080,00:37:32.900,"Ummm, so good!"
00:37:32.920,00:37:33.980,我真羡慕你,,,
00:37:34.880,00:37:35.940,只要一有吃的,00:37:33.800,00:37:35.360,How I envy you!
00:37:36.280,00:37:37.150,便什么烦心事,,,
00:37:37.440,00:37:38.830,都抛到九霄云外去了,00:37:35.540,00:37:39.960,You can always toss your worries out of the clouds when you see food.
00:37:39.720,00:37:42.150,书中常说心思悟纯,00:37:40.880,00:37:43.640,I've read in books that one's heart and mind follow innate purity.
00:37:42.720,00:37:44.990,大抵就是说你这样性子的人吧,00:37:43.960,00:37:46.420,That is probably how you would be described.
00:37:46.040,00:37:47.630,我才不管什么心思纯不纯,,,
00:37:47.920,00:37:49.270,东西好吃我便高兴,00:37:47.160,00:37:48.680,I don't care about purity.
00:37:49.960,00:37:52.030,我听雨儿说你喜欢吃菱粉香糕,00:37:48.980,00:37:50.980,"When the food is good, my heart will follow."
00:37:52.400,00:37:53.830,就让小厨房给备下了,00:37:50.980,00:37:53.340,I heard from Mist that you like water caltrop cakes.
00:37:54.480,00:37:55.750,又兑了些牛乳进去,00:37:53.560,00:37:56.680,so I told the kitchen to make some for you with milk.
00:37:56.080,00:37:57.140,会格外松软一些,00:37:56.900,00:37:58.360,The milk makes it more fluffy.
00:37:57.560,00:37:59.350,你这里做的比我们那儿好吃多了,00:37:58.460,00:38:00.440,The cake is much better than what we have at home.
00:37:59.760,00:38:00.510,你若喜欢吃,,,
00:38:00.800,00:38:02.310,我就让小厨房天天备着,00:38:00.920,00:38:03.240,I'll tell the kitchen to make this everyday if you like.
00:38:02.960,00:38:05.070,只是一样 不许吃撑了肚子,00:38:04.080,00:38:06.960,"But remember, don't overindulge yourself."
00:38:08.920,00:38:09.630,莞姐姐,00:38:10.180,00:38:11.520,"Sourire,"
00:38:10.920,00:38:12.950,真的有个小孩在你肚子里面吗,00:38:12.140,00:38:14.380,is there really a baby growing in your belly?
00:38:13.880,00:38:14.670,是啊,,,
00:38:15.120,00:38:17.420,不过他还是个很小很小的孩子,00:38:15.100,00:38:16.120,Yes.
00:38:17.760,00:38:19.430,连手和脚都没有长出来呢,00:38:16.120,00:38:20.260,But he is so small that he might not even have hands or feet yet.
00:38:19.800,00:38:20.670,这样小啊,00:38:20.980,00:38:22.200,Really?
00:38:25.800,00:38:26.710,你若喜欢他,,,
00:38:27.400,00:38:29.230,我把他给你做外甥好不好,00:38:26.960,00:38:30.220,"If you like him, he will be your nephew."
00:38:29.960,00:38:32.310,真的吗 我可以做他姨娘,00:38:31.080,00:38:33.100,Really? I will be his aunt?
,,,00:38:33.360,00:38:34.320,Yes.
00:38:37.280,00:38:38.750,那 这是我的定礼,00:38:38.200,00:38:39.840,This is my deposit
00:38:38.960,00:38:40.670,以后他就得管我叫姨娘了,00:38:39.840,00:38:41.860,for him to be my nephew.
00:38:41.240,00:38:43.620,礼都收下了 自然是赖不了了,00:38:42.280,00:38:44.740,"Since I have received your gift, I can't renege on it now."
00:38:45.120,00:38:46.630,你瞧你姨娘对你多好,00:38:45.740,00:38:47.700,How nice your aunt is to you!
00:38:46.840,00:38:49.030,还没个影儿呢 礼都送来了,00:38:47.860,00:38:50.400,She has already sent her gift before you are born.
00:38:51.480,00:38:55.070,宝贝 宝贝 你要快快地长啊,00:38:52.640,00:38:55.620,"Nephew, grow up quickly."
00:38:55.680,00:38:56.590,等你长大了,,,
00:38:56.800,00:38:58.630,姨娘就把天底下最好吃的东西,,,
00:38:58.920,00:38:59.870,都让给你吃,00:38:56.880,00:39:00.960,"When you grow up, I will give you all the delicious food in the world."
00:39:00.560,00:39:03.870,什么桃花姬 糯米糕 豆沙卷,00:39:01.540,00:39:06.680,"Taohuaji cakes, rice cakes, red bean rolls, and pickled lychee."
00:39:04.240,00:39:05.460,还有荔枝好郎君,,,
00:39:06.120,00:39:07.550,绝对不和你抢,,,
00:39:08.040,00:39:09.990,你就等着吃成一个胖娃娃吧,00:39:07.360,00:39:09.080,I'll never say you can't have them.
00:39:10.400,00:39:12.550,还有啊 你姨娘还要给你生,00:39:09.320,00:39:11.060,You will be a plump child.
00:39:12.800,00:39:14.430,好多好多宝贝孩儿跟你做伴呢,00:39:11.480,00:39:15.260,"And your aunt is going to have so many
children so you will have friends."
00:39:14.720,00:39:15.590,高不高兴啊,00:39:15.620,00:39:17.240,Are you happy about that?
00:39:16.240,00:39:18.190,姐姐不害羞 笑话我呢,00:39:17.280,00:39:19.300,"Sourire, stop teasing me!"
00:39:22.720,00:39:23.860,淳小主跑得真快,,,
00:39:24.120,00:39:25.180,一溜烟儿就没影了,00:39:23.600,00:39:26.980,Attendant Chun goes like the wind.
00:39:29.160,00:39:31.790,姐姐 那我生七八个小孩,00:39:30.340,00:39:34.200,"Sourire, how about I have seven or eight
kids to play hide-and-seek with him?"
00:39:32.200,00:39:34.270,陪姐姐的小孩躲猫猫 够吗,00:39:34.200,00:39:35.280,Is that enough?
00:39:34.480,00:39:36.710,够了够了 再多咱们也管不了了,00:39:35.380,00:39:38.080,That's enough. They will be a lot of work.
00:39:51.280,00:39:54.790,娘娘 两位江太医刚才来过了,00:39:52.400,00:39:57.560,"Your Highness, Dr. Jiang Chen and
Dr. Jiang Shen were here for a routine visit."
00:39:55.120,00:39:56.470,要给娘娘请平安脉,,,
00:39:57.240,00:39:59.190,后来得知皇上要过来用膳,00:39:58.000,00:40:00.460,But they were informed that His Majesty is coming for lunch
00:39:59.680,00:40:01.350,他们两个在这里不方便,00:40:00.800,00:40:02.680,and it would be improper for them to be here.
00:40:01.600,00:40:04.430,所以便留下话说傍晚时候再来,00:40:02.840,00:40:05.520,So they said they will come this evening.
00:40:05.960,00:40:06.750,对了,,,
00:40:08.000,00:40:10.300,碎玉轩那个有身孕不能侍寝,00:40:07.040,00:40:08.420,"By the way,"
00:40:10.640,00:40:11.950,皇上还常去看她,00:40:09.180,00:40:12.820,"His Majesty still visits the Palace of
Pearl Jade a lot even though she's pregnant."
00:40:12.680,00:40:14.750,让江太医提醒皇上少去,00:40:13.940,00:40:16.240,Ask Dr. Jiang to advise His Majesty not to.
00:40:16.800,00:40:20.150,虽说莞贵人现在有了身孕 可是,00:40:17.820,00:40:20.200,"Even though Lady Sourire is now pregnant,"
00:40:20.400,00:40:22.310,还有一个小狐媚子淳常在呢,00:40:20.600,00:40:23.600,there's also that little vixen Attendant Chun.
00:40:23.400,00:40:24.380,倒是便宜了她,00:40:24.400,00:40:26.900,It's lucky for her that Sourire cannot serve the Emperor overnight.
00:40:26.160,00:40:28.150,小小年纪一股子妖媚,00:40:27.120,00:40:29.440,What a bewitching young girl!
00:40:28.920,00:40:30.790,装天真无知博皇上喜欢,00:40:29.960,00:40:32.840,She acts innocent and plays dumb to gain His Majesty's favor.
00:40:33.960,00:40:34.990,娘娘别生气,,,
00:40:35.400,00:40:37.270,不过是一个小丫头片子罢了,00:40:34.980,00:40:36.480,Your Highness must not be angry.
00:40:37.720,00:40:38.780,她言行无状,00:40:36.600,00:40:38.280,She is nobody in the palace.
00:40:39.880,00:40:41.230,娘娘什么时候寻个由头,00:40:38.660,00:40:40.320,She is ill-mannered
00:40:41.600,00:40:42.910,把她料理了便是了,00:40:40.900,00:40:44.280,and Your Highness will be able to find a reason to remove her.
00:40:46.560,00:40:48.550,姑姑是宫里积年的老姑姑了,,,
00:40:48.920,00:40:50.950,能得姑姑为我梳册封的发髻,00:40:48.080,00:40:49.980,"Madam, you are well respected in the palace."
00:40:51.280,00:40:52.230,那真是我的福气,00:40:50.100,00:40:53.020,"I am distinctly honored to have you
arrange my hair for the ceremony, Madam."
00:40:53.360,00:40:56.980,小主啊 您的额发生得真高,00:40:54.440,00:40:57.960,"My Lady, your hairline is high."
00:40:58.120,00:40:59.030,老奴啊,,,
00:40:59.240,00:41:01.700,在宫里为那么多的小主梳过头,00:40:59.060,00:41:02.660,"Of all the concubines I have served,"
00:41:02.000,00:41:04.270,就属小主的额发最高,00:41:03.040,00:41:05.320,you have the tallest.
00:41:05.520,00:41:08.590,如今哪 小主又身怀有孕,00:41:06.567,00:41:09.637,"Now that you are with child, My Lady,"
00:41:09.160,00:41:11.790,真是福泽深厚啊,00:41:10.183,00:41:12.813,it shows you have great blessings from Heaven.
00:41:12.200,00:41:14.390,其他人是不能比的,00:41:13.271,00:41:15.461,No one else is comparable.
00:41:14.640,00:41:16.390,是啊 宫里人都知道,,,
00:41:16.760,00:41:18.430,额发生得越高福气越大,00:41:15.640,00:41:19.485,"Exactly. Everyone knows that the higher
one's hairline is, the more blessed they are."
00:41:18.640,00:41:20.030,小主一看就是有福的人,00:41:19.560,00:41:21.600,"It's evident that you are greatly blessed, My Lady."
00:41:22.120,00:41:22.870,好重啊,00:41:22.280,00:41:24.040,"Ah, it's so heavy."
00:41:23.640,00:41:24.780,如今只是封莞嫔,,,
00:41:25.000,00:41:26.430,小主就嫌头上首饰重了,00:41:24.620,00:41:27.640,"If you think this head ornament is too heavy,"
00:41:26.840,00:41:28.830,那以后当了贵妃 可怎么好呢,00:41:27.840,00:41:29.940,what happens when you become a Noble Consort?
00:41:29.160,00:41:29.870,别胡说,00:41:30.040,00:41:31.120,Stop it!
00:41:30.360,00:41:31.870,姑娘所言极是,00:41:31.300,00:41:32.980,Vermilion is right.
00:41:32.400,00:41:35.070,小主要是生下皇子,00:41:33.440,00:41:36.120,"If you give birth to a prince, My Lady,"
00:41:35.680,00:41:38.750,还怕没有封贵妃的那一日吗,00:41:36.714,00:41:40.686,there will come a day when you become a Noble Consort.
