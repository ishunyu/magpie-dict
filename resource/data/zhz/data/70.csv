00:02:23.010,00:02:23.880,这是怎么了,,,
00:02:24.260,00:02:25.090,你还有脸问,00:02:23.743,00:02:25.260,What is going on?
00:02:26.060,00:02:27.220,你妹妹挑来的人,00:02:25.260,00:02:26.846,You should be ashamed to ask.
00:02:27.890,00:02:29.680,做出这种不知廉耻的事,00:02:26.846,00:02:28.890,The woman your sister sent here
00:02:30.190,00:02:31.600,是谁不知廉耻,00:02:28.890,00:02:31.080,committed an utterly shameless act.
,,,00:02:31.190,00:02:33.560,Is she truly the shameless one?
00:02:32.610,00:02:35.600,这信到底也不是瑛贵人写的,00:02:33.610,00:02:36.800,"After all, it was not Noble Lady Lustré
who wrote this letter."
00:02:36.440,00:02:37.150,什么信哪,,,
00:02:37.650,00:02:38.310,是这样,00:02:37.097,00:02:38.650,What letter?
00:02:39.150,00:02:41.270,昨儿我让如意去御膳房拿宵夜,00:02:38.650,00:02:40.150,This is what happened.
,,,00:02:40.160,00:02:42.556,"Last night, I asked Ruyi to bring some snacks
from the Imperial Kitchen."
00:02:41.820,00:02:44.490,正好碰见三阿哥身边的小乐子,00:02:42.820,00:02:45.520,"She happened to see Xiao-Lezi,
the Third Prince's servant."
00:02:44.830,00:02:46.530,在长街上鬼鬼祟祟,00:02:45.680,00:02:47.345,He was lurking around Long Street.
00:02:46.790,00:02:47.900,三阿哥一向稳重,,,
00:02:48.460,00:02:49.370,不是那样的人,00:02:47.360,00:02:49.158,The Third Prince has always been prudent.
00:02:49.870,00:02:50.740,一向稳重,00:02:49.460,00:02:50.870,He's not that kind of person.
00:02:51.420,00:02:53.160,恐怕也是表像而已,00:02:50.870,00:02:52.420,He's been prudent?
,,,00:02:52.420,00:02:54.500,I'm afraid that's just a façade.
00:02:53.840,00:02:56.580,皇后娘娘 恕臣妾冒昧,00:02:54.840,00:02:57.760,"Your Majesty, please forgive my bluntness."
00:02:57.010,00:02:59.540,娘娘教子不善哪,00:02:57.949,00:03:00.540,But you haven't educated your son well.
00:02:59.840,00:03:01.670,三阿哥年轻 不懂人事,00:03:00.540,00:03:03.040,The Third Prince is young and lacks worldly wisdom.
00:03:02.430,00:03:03.590,一定是贱婢勾引,00:03:03.430,00:03:05.600,This worthless wretch must have seduced him.
00:03:04.680,00:03:08.010,皇上 臣妾没有 臣妾没有,00:03:05.680,00:03:08.835,"Your Majesty, I did not...  I did not!"
00:03:08.270,00:03:09.630,人是果郡王府挑上来的,00:03:08.835,00:03:10.761,She was selected by Noble Prince Guo's estate.
00:03:10.440,00:03:12.220,粗使的贱婢能有什么好的,00:03:11.251,00:03:13.328,No good can come from a lowly maid.
00:03:13.310,00:03:14.970,臣妾以为 这件事,,,
00:03:15.190,00:03:17.310,三阿哥一定是无辜受牵连哪,00:03:14.310,00:03:18.480,"I believe that the Third Prince is innocent here
and has been framed."
00:03:17.780,00:03:19.060,可是现在人赃俱在,,,
00:03:19.570,00:03:21.180,这信是三阿哥的亲笔呀,00:03:18.614,00:03:20.480,But the messenger was caught red-handed.
00:03:21.450,00:03:23.060,那也一定是贱婢勾引在先,00:03:20.570,00:03:22.400,The Third Prince wrote this letter himself!
00:03:23.240,00:03:23.520,可是,00:03:22.450,00:03:24.120,This wretch must have first seduced him!
00:03:23.700,00:03:24.860,好了 别吵了,,,
00:03:25.120,00:03:25.820,皇上,00:03:24.249,00:03:26.080,"- But...
- Enough, stop arguing."
00:03:26.240,00:03:28.230,您别冤枉了您的亲生儿子呀,00:03:26.120,00:03:27.240,Your Majesty!
,,,00:03:27.240,00:03:29.280,You cannot let your own son suffer such injustice!
00:03:29.290,00:03:32.620,皇上 臣妾真的没有勾引三阿哥,00:03:30.290,00:03:33.600,"Your Majesty, I truly didn't seduce the Third Prince!"
00:03:32.830,00:03:34.950,你行事不检 勾引皇子,00:03:33.760,00:03:36.245,You acted improperly and seduced an imperial prince.
00:03:36.000,00:03:37.240,朕赐你一个了断,00:03:36.962,00:03:38.880,I now grant you a way to end your own life.
00:03:37.880,00:03:40.120,皇上 真的没有,00:03:38.880,00:03:41.120,"Your Majesty, I didn't do it!"
00:03:40.670,00:03:42.460,前因后果你都讲了一遍,,,
00:03:42.880,00:03:43.960,朕不想再听了,00:03:41.670,00:03:45.420,"You have told me your whole story,
and I don't want to hear any more of it."
00:03:44.760,00:03:45.340,苏培盛,,,
00:03:45.890,00:03:46.420,奴才在,,,
00:03:47.180,00:03:48.420,带下去 赐白绫,00:03:45.760,00:03:48.080,"- Su Peisheng.
- Your Majesty."
00:03:49.100,00:03:49.760,嗻,00:03:48.180,00:03:50.040,Take her out and bestow her a length of white silk.
00:03:50.230,00:03:50.930,皇上,00:03:50.100,00:03:51.080,Yes.
00:03:51.060,00:03:51.760,来人,00:03:51.230,00:03:53.640,"- Your Majesty!
- You two, come here!"
00:03:52.640,00:03:54.380,皇上 皇上,00:03:53.640,00:03:55.380,Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
00:03:54.810,00:03:55.770,我冤枉啊,00:03:55.810,00:03:57.020,I'm not guilty!
00:03:56.020,00:03:58.140,皇上,00:03:57.020,00:03:58.600,Your Majesty!
00:03:58.320,00:03:59.060,好了,00:03:58.680,00:03:59.160,Your Majesty.
00:03:59.440,00:04:00.770,我冤枉啊,00:03:59.160,00:04:00.060,Enough!
,,,00:04:00.060,00:04:02.123,I'm not guilty!
00:04:04.870,00:04:07.150,弘时在奉先殿已经跪了大半夜了,00:04:05.870,00:04:08.880,"Hongshi has been kneeling since late last night
in Fengxian Hall [for Ancestor Worship]."
00:04:08.370,00:04:10.320,今日之事就到此为止,00:04:09.370,00:04:11.320,This matter ends here.
00:04:11.000,00:04:13.950,朕不想在宫里听到一句闲话,00:04:12.000,00:04:15.200,"I don't want to hear a word
of gossip in the palace."
00:04:14.420,00:04:15.200,是,,,
00:04:15.920,00:04:16.830,你们先退下,00:04:15.420,00:04:16.920,Yes.
00:04:17.540,00:04:19.280,朕有事问熹贵妃,00:04:16.920,00:04:18.540,You two are dismissed.
,,,00:04:18.540,00:04:20.884,I have a question for Noble Consort Lumière.
00:04:22.010,00:04:23.170,臣妾告退,00:04:23.010,00:04:24.727, I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:04:29.140,00:04:32.720,瑛贵人是玉福晋挑来的,00:04:30.140,00:04:34.440,Did Lord Consort Yu select Noble Lady Lustré?
00:04:33.600,00:04:34.220,是,,,
00:04:34.730,00:04:35.810,会不会有人,00:04:34.600,00:04:35.730,Yes.
,,,00:04:35.730,00:04:37.770,Is it possible that...
00:04:36.770,00:04:39.940,教唆瑛贵人勾引朕的皇子,00:04:37.770,00:04:40.960,"someone arranged for Noble Lady Lustré
to seduce an imperial prince,"
00:04:40.280,00:04:41.190,意图皇位,00:04:41.040,00:04:42.320,in order to usurp my throne?
00:04:41.570,00:04:43.930,皇上为何这样问,00:04:42.320,00:04:45.030,"Your Majesty, why do you ask?"
00:04:46.870,00:04:48.230,弘时是长子,00:04:47.654,00:04:49.402,Hongshi is my eldest son.
00:04:49.370,00:04:53.200,朝中立长立幼之争此起彼伏,00:04:50.370,00:04:54.426,"The court is hotly debating whether to name
him or a younger prince as the Crown Prince."
00:04:54.210,00:04:55.660,败坏了弘时的名声,00:04:55.210,00:04:57.250,Destroying Hongshi's reputation
00:04:56.250,00:04:57.910,也就是败坏了朕的名声,00:04:57.250,00:04:59.255,is the same as destroying mine.
00:05:00.380,00:05:02.990,皇上 玉隐万万不敢,00:05:01.380,00:05:04.465,"Your Majesty, Yuyin would absolutely never dare to do that."
00:05:04.930,00:05:07.710,她不敢 果郡王呢,00:05:05.930,00:05:08.800,"She would not, but what about
Noble Prince Guo?"
00:05:08.140,00:05:09.090,臣妾也敢担保,,,
00:05:09.550,00:05:10.510,你凭什么担保,00:05:08.960,00:05:10.550,"I can vouch for him, too."
,,,00:05:10.550,00:05:12.481,On what grounds do you vouch for him?
00:05:12.560,00:05:14.010,这宫里的每一个人,00:05:13.215,00:05:15.096,Everyone in this palace
00:05:15.140,00:05:18.850,都经历过先帝九王夺嫡之乱,00:05:16.140,00:05:20.236,"experienced the chaos of the nine lords'
battle for the throne"
00:05:19.820,00:05:23.350,皇子们对皇位的渴望是多么可怕,00:05:20.820,00:05:24.640,"and how terrifying the princes' lust
for the throne was."
00:05:24.990,00:05:25.900,果郡王,,,
00:05:27.110,00:05:29.650,也曾是先帝属意的太子人选,00:05:25.990,00:05:30.640,"Noble Prince Guo was one of the prior emperor's
preferred choices for Crown Prince."
00:05:31.540,00:05:34.400,皇上英明 果郡王真的不敢,00:05:32.540,00:05:35.600,"Your Majesty is wise.
But Noble Prince Guo truly would not dare."
00:05:34.700,00:05:35.940,朕怕就怕在,,,
00:05:36.870,00:05:38.280,他不敢对朕如何,00:05:35.700,00:05:37.870,My concern is that
00:05:39.250,00:05:41.290,所以借玉福晋之手,00:05:37.870,00:05:40.000,"although he dares not do anything to me,"
00:05:42.300,00:05:43.960,打朕的皇子们的主意,00:05:40.250,00:05:42.775,he could be using Lord Consort Yu's hands
00:05:44.460,00:05:45.200,这些年,00:05:43.341,00:05:45.526,to scheme against my sons.
00:05:46.380,00:05:48.370,果郡王对皇上是忠心耿耿的,00:05:45.703,00:05:49.584,"All these years, Noble Prince Guo's heart has been
loyal and devoted to Your Majesty."
00:05:48.640,00:05:49.590,忠心耿耿,00:05:49.584,00:05:50.963,Loyal and devoted?
00:05:51.140,00:05:53.130,谁能挖出他的心来看一看,00:05:52.140,00:05:54.777,Who can gouge out his heart and prove that?
00:05:58.140,00:05:59.480,所以今天的事,,,
00:06:00.310,00:06:03.480,哪怕你和敬贵妃,00:05:59.140,00:06:06.560,"So, even though you and Noble Consort Estime
feel that I have wrongly convicted Noble Lady Lustré,"
00:06:03.780,00:06:05.390,都觉得朕冤了瑛贵人,,,
00:06:05.820,00:06:07.940,朕也要保全皇家的名声,00:06:06.760,00:06:09.019,I have to protect the reputation of the imperial family.
00:06:08.570,00:06:09.810,保全自己的皇子,00:06:09.396,00:06:11.320,I must protect my son.
00:06:10.410,00:06:12.490,不能给任何人以可乘之机,00:06:11.410,00:06:14.000,"I can't expose myself
to any potential manipulation."
00:06:13.030,00:06:13.690,皇上,00:06:14.030,00:06:15.247,"Your Majesty,"
00:06:14.700,00:06:17.490,瑛贵人着实冤屈,00:06:15.700,00:06:18.721,Noble Lady Lustré has truly suffered injustice.
00:06:17.910,00:06:18.870,为了大清,00:06:18.910,00:06:20.460,"It was done for the Great Qing,"
00:06:19.460,00:06:21.700,冤了她一个不算冤,00:06:20.460,00:06:23.200,therefore it was not an injustice to have wronged her.
00:06:23.380,00:06:25.540,既然玉隐是你的义妹,00:06:24.380,00:06:26.797,"Since Yuyin is your honorary sister,"
00:06:27.170,00:06:28.750,你确实得避一避嫌,00:06:28.170,00:06:30.240,suspicion must be averted from you.
00:06:30.140,00:06:32.090,最近宫中琐事繁多,00:06:31.140,00:06:34.180,"There have been so many trivial matters
in the palace lately."
00:06:33.180,00:06:34.170,你也许累了,00:06:34.180,00:06:35.660,Perhaps you're tired.
00:06:35.810,00:06:38.170,有事情就让皇后打理吧,00:06:36.810,00:06:39.520,The Empress will take care of the palace affairs
00:06:38.520,00:06:40.260,或者敬贵妃也可以帮忙,00:06:39.520,00:06:41.637,and Noble Consort Estime will assist her.
00:06:40.980,00:06:41.930,皇上这样说,00:06:41.980,00:06:44.243,Is Your Majesty...
00:06:45.030,00:06:46.270,是怀疑臣妾吗,,,
00:06:46.860,00:06:47.940,皇后说得对,00:06:45.912,00:06:47.662,suspicious of me?
00:06:49.200,00:06:50.230,你有皇子,00:06:47.680,00:06:49.341,The Empress is right.
00:06:51.450,00:06:53.690,此事确实脱不了干系,00:06:50.200,00:06:52.450,"As the mother of an imperial prince,"
,,,00:06:52.450,00:06:55.135,you cannot escape suspicion.
00:07:28.150,00:07:28.770,皇阿玛,00:07:29.150,00:07:30.935,Imperial Father.
00:07:47.170,00:07:48.250,这两个耳光,00:07:48.170,00:07:50.307,Two slaps:
00:07:49.760,00:07:53.370,一个打你敢觊觎皇阿玛的女人,00:07:50.760,00:07:55.022,"One for coveting your Imperial Father's woman,"
00:07:54.550,00:07:57.640,一个打你敢觊觎天子的女人,00:07:55.550,00:07:59.154,The other for coveting the Emperor's woman.
00:07:59.470,00:08:00.090,皇阿玛,,,
00:08:00.850,00:08:01.810,都是儿臣的错,00:08:00.470,00:08:01.850,Imperial Father!
00:08:02.480,00:08:03.560,求皇阿玛宽恕,00:08:01.850,00:08:02.923,This is all my fault.
,,,00:08:03.480,00:08:04.711,I beg for your forgiveness.
00:08:04.480,00:08:05.940,朕当然会宽恕你,00:08:05.480,00:08:07.015,Of course I will forgive you.
00:08:06.690,00:08:08.730,不仅是因为你是朕的长子,00:08:07.690,00:08:10.178,"Not only because you're my eldest son,"
00:08:09.480,00:08:11.190,更是爱新觉罗的子孙,00:08:10.480,00:08:12.480,but also a son of the Aisin-Gioro Clan.
00:08:11.820,00:08:13.400,不能丢皇家的颜面,00:08:12.820,00:08:15.160,The prestige of the imperial family must be protected.
00:08:14.320,00:08:16.190,是 儿臣知错了,00:08:15.320,00:08:17.570,"Yes, I admit my fault."
00:08:16.570,00:08:17.400,你知错,00:08:17.570,00:08:19.280,You admit your fault.
00:08:18.330,00:08:20.780,这个错会有人替你背起来,00:08:19.330,00:08:21.780,But someone else has shouldered the blame for you.
00:08:21.580,00:08:23.320,朕已经处死了瑛贵人,00:08:22.580,00:08:24.800,I have already executed Noble Lady Lustré.
00:08:25.790,00:08:27.750,她 她,00:08:26.790,00:08:28.750,She... she...
00:08:28.040,00:08:29.080,她当然是无辜的,,,
00:08:29.670,00:08:30.660,错在你,00:08:28.750,00:08:30.670,Of course she was innocent.
00:08:31.840,00:08:33.170,可你是朕的儿子,00:08:30.670,00:08:32.425,You're the one to blame.
00:08:34.470,00:08:36.800,朕不能为了一个女人,00:08:32.840,00:08:34.472,"But you are my son,"
00:08:37.470,00:08:38.680,而不保全你,00:08:35.470,00:08:40.000,"and I can't expose you to harm
just because of a woman."
00:08:41.140,00:08:42.550,是我害死了她,,,
00:08:43.230,00:08:43.930,对,00:08:41.784,00:08:44.230,I caused her death!
00:08:44.600,00:08:45.720,就是你害了她,00:08:44.230,00:08:45.600,Yes.
00:08:46.650,00:08:47.730,不知天高地厚,00:08:45.600,00:08:47.160,You caused her death!
00:08:48.270,00:08:49.350,不知人伦纲纪,00:08:47.650,00:08:49.270,"You forgot ""the bounds of Heaven and Earth"""
00:08:50.070,00:08:50.770,皇阿玛,00:08:49.270,00:08:51.070,"and ""the moral ethics of human beings."""
00:08:51.860,00:08:53.940,好好在这儿忏悔你的过失,00:08:51.070,00:08:52.860,Imperial Father...
00:08:55.860,00:08:57.150,若再有过失,00:08:52.860,00:08:55.283,Stay here and reflect deeply on your wrongdoings.
00:08:57.910,00:08:59.400,朕也保全不了你,00:08:56.860,00:08:58.800,"If you make another mistake,"
,,,00:08:58.910,00:09:01.000,even I will not be able to save you.
00:09:21.100,00:09:21.760,妹妹,,,
00:09:24.430,00:09:25.670,妹妹这里真安静啊,00:09:22.100,00:09:23.553,Lumière.
00:09:26.480,00:09:27.970,连落花的声音都听得见,00:09:25.430,00:09:27.065,It's so quiet here.
00:09:30.020,00:09:32.010,难得妹妹的宫里,00:09:27.480,00:09:29.613,You can even hear the flowers falling.
00:09:32.480,00:09:33.890,也有这么安静的时候,00:09:31.020,00:09:34.880,Your palace is hardly ever this quiet.
00:09:35.780,00:09:38.070,宫里的人不会专宠一辈子的,00:09:36.780,00:09:39.070,No one in the palace is favored forever.
00:09:39.570,00:09:41.280,想明白了便也不怕了,00:09:40.570,00:09:42.575,"Once you realize this, there is nothing to fear."
00:09:42.330,00:09:43.160,失宠,,,
00:09:44.080,00:09:45.570,你若觉得这日子煎熬,00:09:43.330,00:09:44.740,Losing favor -
00:09:46.160,00:09:47.620,那这日子过得也煎熬,00:09:45.080,00:09:47.160,"If you treat it as a torment,"
00:09:48.330,00:09:49.200,你若坦然,00:09:47.160,00:09:49.330,then your life will be a torment.
00:09:49.580,00:09:51.070,这日子过得也坦然,00:09:49.330,00:09:50.580,"If you face it calmly,"
00:09:52.960,00:09:54.250,一切无关其他,00:09:50.580,00:09:52.670,then your life will be calm.
00:09:54.880,00:09:56.290,只在于自己的心境,00:09:53.960,00:09:57.600,Nothing matters but one's own state of mind.
00:09:58.640,00:09:59.420,姐姐有空,,,
00:10:00.140,00:10:02.050,陪我为瑛贵人上灶香吧,00:09:59.338,00:10:01.329,"When you get a chance, Estime,"
00:10:03.060,00:10:04.010,也是可怜人,00:10:01.329,00:10:03.645,could you offer incense to Noble Lady Lustré with me?
00:10:04.520,00:10:05.130,好,00:10:04.060,00:10:05.520,She is a pitiful soul.
00:10:06.350,00:10:07.510,这次都是怪我,00:10:05.520,00:10:06.822,All right.
00:10:08.060,00:10:10.180,本想借着三阿哥的事打压皇后,00:10:07.350,00:10:09.060,It was all my fault.
00:10:11.230,00:10:12.560,谁想下手太重,00:10:09.060,00:10:11.652,My intention was to limit the Empress's power.
00:10:14.150,00:10:15.610,反而伤了你和瑛贵人,00:10:12.381,00:10:14.374,But I pushed too hard
00:10:16.570,00:10:17.980,瑛贵人的确无辜,00:10:15.015,00:10:17.181,and blame fell upon you and Noble Lady Lustré instead.
00:10:18.910,00:10:21.490,可是果郡王无端被疑,00:10:17.584,00:10:19.774,Noble Lady Lustré indeed suffered injustice.
00:10:22.280,00:10:23.150,更是无辜,00:10:20.000,00:10:24.345,"Yet Noble Prince Guo was cast under
undue suspicion: a far greater injustice."
00:10:23.830,00:10:24.740,我也没想到,00:10:24.571,00:10:26.320,I never expected this.
00:10:25.410,00:10:27.450,皇上一向是不喜欢三阿哥的,00:10:26.410,00:10:28.450,His Majesty has never liked the Third Prince.
00:10:28.410,00:10:30.410,这件事却处处维护着三阿哥,00:10:29.410,00:10:31.875,Yet he has protected him throughout this affair.
00:10:31.290,00:10:33.530,反而下了重手 杀了瑛贵人,00:10:32.290,00:10:34.744,"He showed a heavy hand in executing Noble Lady Lustré,"
00:10:34.250,00:10:36.210,倒是让皇后趁机反皎一口,00:10:35.250,00:10:37.614,which has given the Empress a chance to bite back
00:10:36.840,00:10:37.800,占了上风,,,
00:10:38.340,00:10:39.420,皇上爱面子,00:10:37.840,00:10:39.340,and gain the upper hand.
00:10:40.140,00:10:41.800,自然要顾及皇家颜面,00:10:39.340,00:10:43.308,"His Majesty values prestige, so he always considers the good name of the imperial family."
00:10:43.100,00:10:44.680,哪怕自己儿子再不好,,,
00:10:45.350,00:10:46.680,可都是自己儿子,00:10:44.100,00:10:46.350,"No matter how much an heir misbehaves,"
00:10:47.270,00:10:48.100,何况此事,00:10:46.350,00:10:48.200,he is still the Emperor's son.
00:10:48.560,00:10:50.470,又关系到国本立嗣之事,00:10:48.270,00:10:51.800,"And in this instance, the designation of
the Crown Prince is also at stake."
00:10:50.980,00:10:52.520,皇上自然更加多心,00:10:51.980,00:10:54.463,"Naturally, His Majesty is more cautious."
00:10:55.320,00:10:57.650,我做了几道你素日爱吃的点心,00:10:56.320,00:10:58.650,I made some of your favorite desserts.
00:10:58.650,00:10:59.940,我倒没什么胃口,00:10:59.427,00:11:01.832,I don't have much of an appetite.
00:11:02.200,00:11:03.730,怎么会突然没有胃口了呢,00:11:03.200,00:11:04.730,What's the matter?
00:11:04.030,00:11:05.400,许是平日里吃多了,00:11:04.730,00:11:07.018,Perhaps I've had too many these days.
00:11:07.410,00:11:09.450,槿汐 制碗酸梅汤来,00:11:08.410,00:11:10.450,"Jinxi, prepare a bowl of sour plum soup."
00:11:09.660,00:11:10.240,是,00:11:10.450,00:11:11.361,Yes.
00:11:11.420,00:11:13.280,你素日里是不吃酸的,00:11:12.266,00:11:14.340,You don't usually like sour food.
00:11:16.210,00:11:18.670,许久没吃了 倒也馋得很,00:11:16.833,00:11:20.399,"It's been a while.
I'm rather craving it now."
00:11:20.470,00:11:22.500,能吃就好 能吃是福,00:11:21.470,00:11:23.764,A good appetite is a blessing in itself.
00:11:26.220,00:11:26.960,妹妹,00:11:25.280,00:11:26.163,Oh...
00:11:28.470,00:11:29.840,你是不是又,00:11:27.182,00:11:28.380,"Lumière,"
,,,00:11:29.280,00:11:31.438,are you again...?
00:11:33.190,00:11:34.850,真是好福气呀,00:11:33.020,00:11:36.236,"Ah, what wonderful blessings you have!"
00:11:35.230,00:11:36.270,有了这个孩子,00:11:36.236,00:11:37.690,"With this baby,"
00:11:36.690,00:11:39.520,眼下的困境就迎刃而解了,00:11:37.690,00:11:40.734,all our current difficulties will be resolved.
00:11:40.570,00:11:42.030,我这就禀告皇上去,00:11:41.570,00:11:43.221,I will go inform His Majesty immediately.
00:11:42.410,00:11:44.990,以宽解我连累你的内疚之心啊,00:11:43.410,00:11:45.990,This soothes my remorse over implicating you.
00:11:46.620,00:11:48.110,我的困境不难解,00:11:47.457,00:11:49.437,My difficulties aren't hard to resolve.
00:11:49.290,00:11:52.450,可我就是担心果郡王和玉隐,00:11:50.290,00:11:53.750,But I'm worried about Noble Prince Guo and Yuyin.
00:11:55.630,00:11:57.080,熹贵妃这两天怎么样,00:11:56.584,00:11:58.487,How has Noble Consort Lumière been these days?
00:11:58.550,00:12:01.540,太医说娘娘脾胃不和,00:11:59.550,00:12:03.953,"The doctors say that Her Highness has been languid
due to disharmony between Spleen and Stomach."
00:12:01.930,00:12:03.040,整日恹恹的,,,
00:12:04.220,00:12:06.050,娘娘心里头一直委屈着,,,
00:12:06.600,00:12:07.680,这也难怪她,00:12:05.220,00:12:08.680,"Her Highness has been feeling aggrieved recently.
She's not to blame."
00:12:08.260,00:12:09.090,不怪她,,,
00:12:10.770,00:12:11.430,怪朕,00:12:09.260,00:12:11.078,She's not?
00:12:12.350,00:12:13.090,奴才不敢,00:12:11.770,00:12:13.161,So I am to blame?
,,,00:12:13.350,00:12:14.589,"I would not dare, Your Majesty."
00:12:15.270,00:12:18.100,朕那天那样问她是事出有因,00:12:16.270,00:12:19.515,I had my reasons for asking her those questions.
00:12:19.570,00:12:20.430,今儿早朝,00:12:20.570,00:12:22.030,"This morning,"
00:12:21.860,00:12:23.770,鄂尔泰和马齐争辩起来,00:12:22.860,00:12:24.985,Ortai and Maci had a heated debate.
00:12:24.740,00:12:26.020,朕听来听去,,,
00:12:26.570,00:12:27.810,还是为了立嗣的事,00:12:25.740,00:12:29.272,"Back and forth... still about
the designation of the Crown Prince."
00:12:28.830,00:12:30.070,这宫里宫外,00:12:29.830,00:12:31.922,"Whether inside or outside the palace,"
00:12:31.450,00:12:32.820,不知道有多少人,00:12:32.450,00:12:34.611,who knows how many people are
00:12:34.290,00:12:36.000,盯着朕的这张龙椅,00:12:35.040,00:12:37.865,eyeing my Dragon Throne.
00:12:38.090,00:12:41.330,公开建储肯定会闹得鸡犬不宁,00:12:39.090,00:12:42.330,"Announcing my chosen Crown Prince is sure to cause
""a tumult of chickens and dogs."""
00:12:42.760,00:12:45.790,朕得有个好法子以备不虞,00:12:43.812,00:12:47.176,I should come up with a plan lest things go wrong.
00:12:46.720,00:12:47.630,皇上说得是,00:12:47.591,00:12:49.178,Your Majesty is wise.
00:12:48.760,00:12:51.430,熹贵妃现在有着身孕,00:12:49.760,00:12:52.430,Noble Consort Lumière is now with child.
00:12:54.310,00:12:56.270,朕不想让她受委屈啊,00:12:55.222,00:12:57.711,I do not wish to see her distressed.
00:12:56.810,00:12:57.770,说来也怪,,,
00:12:58.560,00:12:59.770,怎么这几回的事,00:12:57.711,00:12:59.511,It is strange
00:13:00.150,00:13:03.110,回回都是冲着熹贵妃来的呢,00:12:59.511,00:13:04.472,that all of the recent events have been targeting Noble Consort Lumière.
00:13:04.240,00:13:05.440,颇有蹊跷啊,00:13:05.240,00:13:07.200,It is rather suspicious.
00:13:06.200,00:13:07.440,朕不是不知道,00:13:07.200,00:13:08.704,Not that I'm unaware.
00:13:10.030,00:13:10.900,后宫,00:13:11.030,00:13:12.560,The harem
00:13:13.370,00:13:15.160,表面看起来风平浪静,00:13:14.296,00:13:17.049,seems tranquil on the surface
00:13:16.580,00:13:18.120,实则一团污秽,00:13:17.615,00:13:19.511,but murky waters lie beneath.
00:13:19.340,00:13:20.670,朕有心要清理,,,
00:13:21.670,00:13:22.330,说穿了,00:13:20.341,00:13:22.400,I intend to purify the waters.
00:13:23.090,00:13:24.950,很多时候不过是女人的事,00:13:22.670,00:13:24.090,"But once you touch the bottom,"
00:13:25.170,00:13:26.000,犯不上,00:13:24.090,00:13:27.251,"it is mostly women's concerns, unworthy of my time."
00:13:26.930,00:13:30.760,二则 总有纯元的情分在,00:13:27.930,00:13:31.760,Empress Première's devotion to her sister has led me
00:13:32.720,00:13:35.220,许多时候睁只眼闭只眼,00:13:33.720,00:13:36.021,to turn a blind eye in many situations
00:13:35.520,00:13:36.350,也就过去了,00:13:36.021,00:13:37.440,and the events pass.
00:13:37.730,00:13:38.430,再加上,,,
00:13:39.360,00:13:41.890,仅仅是后宫倒也罢了,00:13:38.730,00:13:43.183,"In sum, trouble within the harem is nothing."
00:13:42.900,00:13:44.060,朕担心的是,00:13:43.900,00:13:45.530,What I'm more concerned about
00:13:45.320,00:13:48.360,后宫和前朝瓜葛着,00:13:46.360,00:13:49.743,is collusion between the court and the harem
00:13:49.950,00:13:50.860,要算计朕,00:13:50.858,00:13:53.404,to plot against me.
00:13:53.490,00:13:55.990,朕不得不小心留意啊,00:13:54.233,00:13:56.733,I have no choice but to be wary.
00:13:58.210,00:13:59.070,皇上英明,00:13:59.210,00:14:00.480,Your Majesty is sage.
00:14:00.380,00:14:03.290,你把朕用的点心送到永寿宫去,00:14:01.380,00:14:04.762,Deliver my desserts to the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:14:04.510,00:14:06.790,让熹贵妃知道朕惦记她,00:14:05.510,00:14:08.180,"Let Noble Consort Lumière know
that I am thinking of her."
00:14:07.180,00:14:08.880,嗻 奴才这就去办,00:14:08.180,00:14:09.880,Yes. I will go right away.

00:14:58.230,00:15:00.060,今天是十五的大日子,00:14:59.230,00:15:01.730,"Today is the fifteenth day of the month -
a grand occasion."
00:15:00.730,00:15:02.220,皇上敬香祈福,00:15:01.730,00:15:04.110,"With His Majesty's incense offering,"
00:15:03.110,00:15:05.440,我大清一定会国泰民安,00:15:04.110,00:15:07.297,our Great Qing will be peaceful and prosperous.
00:15:12.620,00:15:15.280,朕也有好些日子没抱六阿哥了,00:15:13.234,00:15:16.709,I haven't held the Sixth Prince for quite a while.
00:15:19.460,00:15:20.290,又重了些,,,
00:15:21.540,00:15:23.030,六阿哥又长高了,00:15:20.460,00:15:22.540,He's gained some weight.
00:15:23.710,00:15:25.070,到底皇上挂心,00:15:22.540,00:15:24.332,The Sixth Prince has grown taller again.
00:15:25.290,00:15:26.750,六阿哥也想着要为皇上,00:15:24.710,00:15:26.290,"Because of Your Majesty's care,"
00:15:27.130,00:15:28.420,快点长高长大呢,00:15:26.290,00:15:29.410,he wants to grow taller and stronger for Your Majesty.
00:15:28.710,00:15:30.420,朕记挂着阿哥和公主,00:15:29.712,00:15:32.108,"I care for the princes and the princesses,"
00:15:31.760,00:15:33.300,自然也记挂着你们,00:15:32.760,00:15:34.857,and of course I care for all of you.
00:15:35.390,00:15:37.130,天一天比一天的热了,00:15:36.390,00:15:38.130,The days are getting hotter.
00:15:38.310,00:15:40.220,别贪凉吃生冷的东西,00:15:39.310,00:15:41.220,Don't seek relief by eating raw or cold foods.
00:15:41.020,00:15:42.470,别挂着汗去吹风,00:15:42.020,00:15:43.850,Don't stand in a draught when you're sweating.
00:15:42.850,00:15:45.350,多谢皇上关怀,00:15:43.850,00:15:46.560,I thank Your Majesty for your caring words.
00:15:45.610,00:15:48.440,今日晨起听见熹贵妃咳嗽了两声,00:15:46.610,00:15:49.440,I heard Noble Consort Lumière coughing when getting up this morning.
00:15:49.650,00:15:51.520,朕心里便不大安乐,00:15:50.650,00:15:52.671,It made my mind ill at ease.
00:15:53.110,00:15:54.820,熹贵妃素来劳累,00:15:54.110,00:15:56.061,Noble Consort Lumière has always exerted herself.
00:15:55.740,00:15:57.610,如果你们未能帮衬,00:15:56.740,00:15:58.876,"If you cannot be helpful,"
00:15:58.580,00:16:00.410,反而叫她添了一丝烦恼,00:15:59.253,00:16:01.750,"and instead cause her even a shred of worry,"
00:16:00.750,00:16:03.490,那便是叫朕心里更不安乐,00:16:01.750,00:16:04.490,that will upset me even more.
00:16:04.710,00:16:05.950,是,00:16:05.710,00:16:06.950,Yes.
00:16:06.710,00:16:09.200,如今宫里人多,00:16:07.710,00:16:10.200,There are a large number of servants in the harem.
00:16:10.130,00:16:11.590,难免闲话也多,00:16:11.130,00:16:12.854,"Inevitably, that leads to gossip."
00:16:14.220,00:16:15.420,由你宫里起,00:16:15.220,00:16:16.963,"Starting with your own palace,"
00:16:16.680,00:16:19.590,将汉军旗和蒙军旗的宫女,,,
00:16:19.850,00:16:20.800,放出去一批,00:16:17.642,00:16:22.008,expel maids who come from the Han and Mongolian banners.
00:16:22.140,00:16:24.810,只留满军旗的轮流伺候就是,00:16:22.989,00:16:25.920,"The maids from the Manchu banners
will take turns serving."
00:16:25.900,00:16:26.560,是,00:16:26.900,00:16:28.020,Yes.
00:16:27.020,00:16:30.140,只是皇上身边的人是不用裁的,00:16:28.020,00:16:31.140,"Nevertheless, Your Majesty's close servants
should not be expelled."
00:16:31.650,00:16:34.110,朕最不喜欢奴才多话,00:16:32.650,00:16:35.261,I loathe servants who gossip.
00:16:36.490,00:16:39.230,先将那些爱背后生事的,00:16:37.490,00:16:41.990,"First expel those who like to cause trouble
 behind others' backs."
00:16:39.990,00:16:40.730,都赶出去,,,
00:16:42.330,00:16:46.570,如今准葛尔部虎视耽耽,00:16:44.573,00:16:49.633,The Dzungars are now a rising threat on the borders.
00:16:47.540,00:16:48.870,边境不安定,,,
00:16:49.840,00:16:51.700,宫里省下的银子再少,00:16:50.840,00:16:53.564,"Cutting spending within the palace, even small amounts,"
00:16:53.130,00:16:55.840,也是救济前线银粮的一点心意,00:16:54.130,00:16:57.120,demonstrates our support for the front lines.
00:16:57.680,00:17:00.800,你们好自为之吧,00:16:58.680,00:17:02.314,You should all act appropriately.
00:17:03.140,00:17:05.850,臣妾谨遵教诲 儿臣谨遵教诲,00:17:04.140,00:17:07.148,I will obey Your Majesty's instructions.
00:17:09.190,00:17:11.100,我要这个 这个该放这儿,00:17:09.743,00:17:11.910,"- I want this.
- This one should be here."
00:17:12.070,00:17:13.270,这个放这儿比较好,00:17:12.684,00:17:14.490,Putting it here is better.
00:17:13.490,00:17:15.520,我听说宫里裁人了,00:17:14.490,00:17:17.384,I heard servants are being expelled from all over the palace.
00:17:16.610,00:17:19.320,这是皇上在给皇后脸色看呢,00:17:17.610,00:17:21.314,"This is how His Majesty expresses his
displeasure with the Empress."
00:17:20.540,00:17:22.700,皇上的心思是最难猜的,00:17:21.540,00:17:23.856,His Majesty's mind is unfathomable.
00:17:23.120,00:17:24.910,现在天气也热了,00:17:24.045,00:17:26.210,It's getting warmer.
00:17:25.210,00:17:27.040,我看你呀 越发懒得动弹了,00:17:26.210,00:17:28.554,I've noticed that you've been more reluctant to walk around.
00:17:28.170,00:17:30.830,每天懒洋洋的 也没个精神,00:17:29.170,00:17:32.160, Every day you seem fatigued and lethargic.
00:17:31.250,00:17:33.040,此番有孕倒奇怪些,,,
00:17:33.510,00:17:35.000,尤其容易反胃念心,00:17:32.250,00:17:34.510,This pregnancy is a bit strange.
00:17:35.340,00:17:37.920,这心口又总是闷闷的不痛快,00:17:34.510,00:17:39.000,"I'm prone to feeling nauseous, and my chest feels heavy and tight."
00:17:39.100,00:17:42.460,我当年怀胧月的时候也不曾这样,00:17:40.000,00:17:43.810,That wasn't the case when I had Longyue.
00:17:42.810,00:17:45.340,我看 你还是找卫临来看看,00:17:43.810,00:17:46.340,I suggest consulting Doctor Wei Lin.
00:17:45.890,00:17:47.380,虽然之前也生育过,00:17:46.890,00:17:48.720,"Although you've given birth to children before,"
00:17:47.900,00:17:50.310,但凡事还是当心为好,00:17:48.900,00:17:51.310,it's always better to take extra care.
00:17:51.570,00:17:52.900,敬贵妃说得对呀,00:17:52.570,00:17:54.240,Noble Consort Estime is right.
00:17:53.730,00:17:55.850,当初纯元皇后怀孕的时候,,,
00:17:56.150,00:17:57.390,也是百般的不适,00:17:54.730,00:17:58.849,"Empress Première also experienced
much discomfort when she was pregnant."
00:17:58.490,00:17:59.850,这女人生孩子呀,,,
00:18:00.280,00:18:02.440,就如同在鬼门关上走了一遭,00:17:59.490,00:18:04.022,"Giving birth to a child is like
walking by ""the Gate of the Ghosts."""
00:18:03.660,00:18:05.870,纯元皇后这样精心地养着,00:18:04.660,00:18:07.330,"Even though Empress Première was carefully attended to,"
00:18:06.330,00:18:07.950,终究还是母子俱亡,00:18:07.330,00:18:09.613,she and her child didn't escape death.
00:18:09.170,00:18:11.080,宫里的孩子难将养,00:18:09.613,00:18:12.037,Nurturing a child in the palace is hard.
00:18:11.710,00:18:13.540,你前些日子又这样地伤神,00:18:12.710,00:18:14.540,You've been so worried and preoccupied lately.
00:18:14.050,00:18:15.630,还是多多保养为宜,00:18:15.050,00:18:17.273,You should take better care of yourself.
00:18:16.720,00:18:18.000,我也算会偷懒了,,,
00:18:18.430,00:18:19.710,可还是不舒服,00:18:17.720,00:18:20.480,"I've become good at lazing around, but still feel unwell."
00:18:25.270,00:18:27.010,姐姐 姐姐 快追她,00:18:25.620,00:18:28.160,"Sister, sister, chase her!"
00:18:27.310,00:18:29.100,姐姐 姐姐 姐姐 追,,,
00:18:29.400,00:18:31.850,姐姐 姐姐 姐姐,00:18:28.160,00:18:31.080,"Sister, sister! Sister chased by sister!"
00:18:32.060,00:18:33.180,姐姐追着姐姐,00:18:31.124,00:18:32.480,"Sister! Chase her, sister!"
00:18:33.400,00:18:34.230,给我吧 给我吧,00:18:32.550,00:18:34.186,A sister... chased by her sister...
,,,00:18:34.186,00:18:35.817,"Give it to me, give it to me!"
00:18:34.860,00:18:37.600,皇后杀了皇后,00:18:36.194,00:18:39.405,The Empress... killed by the Empress!
00:18:41.160,00:18:43.400,皇后杀了皇后,00:18:42.160,00:18:44.694,The Empress was killed by the Empress?
00:18:45.490,00:18:46.230,你说什么呢,,,
00:18:48.710,00:18:49.990,你就算恨毒了皇后,00:18:46.276,00:18:48.760,What did you say?
00:18:50.370,00:18:51.660,也不能宣之于口啊,00:18:49.710,00:18:53.174,"Even if you resent the Empress to the core,
you cannot say this out loud."
00:18:54.380,00:18:56.330,快 把阿哥和公主都带走,00:18:55.380,00:18:57.654,"Quickly, take the prince and princesses away."
00:18:56.960,00:18:57.790,出去玩吧,00:18:57.960,00:18:59.960,Go play outside.
00:19:07.640,00:19:09.380,你刚才说谁杀了谁,00:19:08.426,00:19:10.852,You were saying who killed who?
00:19:12.730,00:19:14.140,皇后杀了皇后,00:19:13.730,00:19:15.306,The Empress was killed by the Empress.
00:19:15.400,00:19:16.100,皇后,00:19:16.400,00:19:17.486,The Empress...
00:19:18.690,00:19:20.150,你知道了什么是不是,00:19:19.690,00:19:21.321,Have you discovered something?
00:19:23.120,00:19:24.480,并非是我胡言乱语,00:19:23.906,00:19:25.880,I wasn't speaking nonsense;
00:19:25.740,00:19:28.950,这句话是陵容生前的最后一句话,00:19:26.740,00:19:30.207,those were Lingrong's last words before she passed away.
00:19:31.250,00:19:32.830,我总以为她是恨毒了皇后,00:19:31.993,00:19:34.773,"I thought she was telling me
she was killed by the Empress,"
00:19:33.710,00:19:35.420,想要我为她杀了皇后,00:19:34.773,00:19:36.902,and wanted me to kill the Empress for her.
00:19:37.670,00:19:38.710,以她的心机,,,
00:19:39.550,00:19:42.380,若是真恨 大可自己动手,00:19:38.670,00:19:43.748,"With a scheming mind like hers, she could have
taken revenge with her own hands."
00:19:43.390,00:19:45.300,不必临死才来托付于你,00:19:43.962,00:19:46.818,There was no need to entrust you with a dying wish like that.
00:19:46.510,00:19:48.380,我从前从未细想过她这句话,00:19:47.510,00:19:49.747,I hadn't thought carefully about her words before.
00:19:49.980,00:19:51.970,我是方才听灵犀偶然说起一句,,,
00:19:52.400,00:19:53.730,才想起其中的关窍,00:19:50.803,00:19:54.942,"Hearing Lingxi say ""sister chasing sister""
made me think differently..."
00:19:54.940,00:19:58.100,或许还有另一层意思,00:19:55.940,00:19:56.830,maybe...
00:20:01.110,00:20:02.520,看姐姐方才的神情,00:19:57.711,00:20:00.352,Lingrong's words can be understood literally.
00:20:03.280,00:20:04.520,仿佛早有此猜想,00:20:01.954,00:20:05.987,"From the look on your face, it seems like
you‘ve had similar doubts for a long time."
00:20:08.790,00:20:11.620,当年 皇上还是王爷,00:20:09.790,00:20:13.057,"Back when His Majesty was still a lord,"
00:20:12.420,00:20:13.780,宜修又是庶女,00:20:13.057,00:20:15.080,"since Yixiu was the daughter of a secondary wife,"
00:20:14.290,00:20:16.200,所以先封为侧福晋,00:20:15.080,00:20:17.540,she was initially given the title of Lord Consort.
00:20:16.540,00:20:19.290,只待生下皇子便可封为福晋,00:20:17.540,00:20:20.480,"She was to be promoted as the primary wife
if she gave birth to a prince."
00:20:20.670,00:20:24.510,直到那一日 纯元皇后奉旨入府,00:20:21.670,00:20:23.120,"That was until one day,"
00:20:24.800,00:20:26.290,陪伴初有身孕的妹妹,00:20:23.120,00:20:25.600,It was decreed that Empress Première should come to the estate
00:20:26.600,00:20:28.590,谁知在王府就遇上了皇上,00:20:25.600,00:20:27.600,to accompany her newly pregnant younger sister.
,,,00:20:27.600,00:20:30.000,"But when she came across His Majesty,"
00:20:29.520,00:20:31.350,皇上竟然对她一见钟情,00:20:30.520,00:20:32.980,"who could have imagined that
His Majesty would fall in love at first sight?"
00:20:31.980,00:20:34.930,立刻去恳请太后封她为福晋,00:20:32.980,00:20:36.770,"He immediately went to ask the Empress Dowager
to make Empress Première his primary wife."
00:20:35.770,00:20:36.980,皇上执意如此,00:20:36.770,00:20:38.394,"Since His Majesty was so determined and earnest,"
00:20:37.820,00:20:39.930,太后也不能违拗其心意,00:20:38.600,00:20:41.610,the Empress Dowager could not change his mind.
00:20:40.610,00:20:42.400,那 皇上在之前,,,
00:20:43.070,00:20:44.650,从没见过纯元皇后吗,00:20:41.610,00:20:45.672,So His Majesty had never seen the Empress Première before that?
00:20:44.990,00:20:45.980,从未见过,00:20:45.672,00:20:47.005,Never.
00:20:47.830,00:20:50.070,皇上和太后执意如此,00:20:48.830,00:20:51.540,"Since Their Majesties had made up their minds, and"
00:20:50.540,00:20:51.740,宜修也只能说,,,
00:20:51.950,00:20:53.290,嫡庶尊卑有别,00:20:51.540,00:20:54.057,because her elder sister was born with a higher status
00:20:53.460,00:20:55.070,长姐入府应为福晋,00:20:54.057,00:20:57.080,Yixiu conceded that Première should become the primary wife.
00:20:56.080,00:20:58.870,皇上和太后这才松了一口气,00:20:57.080,00:21:00.000,"So, Their Majesties breathed a sigh of relief."
00:20:59.960,00:21:02.370,不久宜修就生下皇子,00:21:00.960,00:21:03.456,"Soon Yixiu gave birth to a prince,"
00:21:02.920,00:21:04.380,可是皇子胎里不足,,,
00:21:04.680,00:21:06.340,未满三岁就去世了,00:21:03.840,00:21:07.970,"but he had prenatal weakness and
passed away before reaching three years of age."
00:21:08.050,00:21:08.880,这个时候,,,
00:21:09.350,00:21:10.930,纯元皇后怀孕了,00:21:09.050,00:21:11.981,"At that time, Empress Première became pregnant."
00:21:11.560,00:21:13.970,纯元皇后入府便是专房之宠,00:21:12.560,00:21:15.734,"His Majesty had been favoring her exclusively
ever since she entered the family."
00:21:14.850,00:21:15.720,怀孕之后,,,
00:21:16.770,00:21:18.060,皇上就对宜修说,,,
00:21:18.810,00:21:19.850,你精通医理,00:21:15.923,00:21:22.922,"After Première conceived, His Majesty told Yixiu that
since she was well-versed in medicine,"
00:21:20.440,00:21:21.900,又是纯元的亲妹妹,,,
00:21:22.190,00:21:23.560,就让她侍奉左右,,,
00:21:23.820,00:21:25.560,帮着太医一同看方子,00:21:22.922,00:21:26.997,"she should take care of her elder sister
and assist the imperial doctors with their prescriptions."
00:21:26.450,00:21:29.310,纯元皇后怀孕后便是百般的不适,00:21:27.450,00:21:30.560,"Empress Première had all kinds of ailments during her pregnancy,"
00:21:29.910,00:21:31.900,临盆的时候惨痛异常,00:21:30.786,00:21:33.158,and suffered unusual and excruciating pain in labor.
00:21:32.330,00:21:34.820,生下一个死胎就撒手人寰,00:21:33.347,00:21:36.009,She departed this world after leaving behind a stillborn child.
00:21:36.710,00:21:37.870,临死的时候,,,
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.080,还伏在皇上的膝上说,00:21:37.710,00:21:41.364,"On her deathbed, she lay on His Majesty's knees and said:"
00:21:40.880,00:21:42.370,不要迁怒于太医,00:21:41.666,00:21:44.130,"""Please do not direct your anger
towards the imperial doctors,"
00:21:43.130,00:21:46.460,更要照顾好自己唯一的妹妹宜修,00:21:44.130,00:21:47.790,"and you must take care of my only sister, Yixiu."""
00:21:47.130,00:21:49.630,纯元皇后入府善待府中诸人,00:21:48.130,00:21:50.801,Empress Première was kind to everyone in the estate.
00:21:50.350,00:21:51.930,可是天不假年,00:21:51.178,00:21:53.280,"But unfortunately, Heaven did not bless her with longevity."
00:21:55.600,00:21:56.220,对了,,,
00:21:57.020,00:21:58.050,就连那个孩子,00:21:56.600,00:21:57.806,Also...
00:21:58.440,00:21:59.800,我也悄悄看过一眼,00:21:58.032,00:22:00.855,I took a secret glimpse of the baby.
00:22:00.270,00:22:02.760,那个孩子身上有好几块青斑,00:22:01.270,00:22:04.190,"That child had quite a few blue spots on his body,"
00:22:03.190,00:22:05.520,一出生便没了气息,00:22:04.190,00:22:06.520,and had no breath at birth.
00:22:06.650,00:22:07.480,青斑,,,
00:22:09.320,00:22:10.560,为何会有青斑呢,00:22:07.650,00:22:09.192,Blue spots?
00:22:11.160,00:22:11.990,皇上知道吗,00:22:10.000,00:22:11.946,Why did the baby have blue spots?
00:22:12.330,00:22:13.070,知道啊,00:22:11.946,00:22:13.330,Does His Majesty know about this?
00:22:13.870,00:22:16.580,太医说是胎中受惊,00:22:13.330,00:22:14.647,Yes.
00:22:16.830,00:22:18.370,血气不足才会如此,00:22:14.836,00:22:19.442,"The doctors said it was due to prenatal shocks,
resulting in weak blood and qi."
00:22:22.880,00:22:24.330,因为皇后的遗言,,,
00:22:24.760,00:22:26.040,太后也不愿,,,
00:22:26.380,00:22:27.840,皇上娶别门女子为正室,00:22:23.745,00:22:29.098,"Because of the Empress's dying wish, the Empress Dowager agreed to make Yixiu the primary wife"
00:22:28.680,00:22:31.010,便也同意了立宜修为福晋,00:22:29.588,00:22:32.056,instead of a woman from a different family.
00:22:32.100,00:22:34.710,这之后的事情你们也都知道了,00:22:32.924,00:22:35.974,You all know what happened after that.
00:22:37.180,00:22:38.470,乌拉娜拉氏宜修,,,
00:22:39.020,00:22:40.560,极看重她正室地位,00:22:38.137,00:22:41.874,"Ula-Nara Yixiu valued the status
of being primary wife above all else."
00:22:41.440,00:22:42.720,被人横刀夺去,,,
00:22:43.610,00:22:46.570,难道她就一点都没有恨意吗,00:22:42.440,00:22:47.520,"Wouldn't she have harbored resentment
when someone robbed it from her?"
00:22:48.030,00:22:49.110,正是如此,00:22:49.030,00:22:50.956,"She must have,"
00:22:50.660,00:22:53.020,可是苦于咱们没有证据呀,00:22:51.672,00:22:54.289,"but unfortunately, we don't have any evidence."
00:22:54.870,00:22:56.580,纯元皇后怀孕之后,,,
00:22:57.660,00:22:59.070,她在身边服侍着,00:22:55.870,00:23:00.281,"During Empress Première's pregnancy,
it was Yixiu who served by her side."
00:23:00.210,00:23:01.990,要是想买通皇后身边的,,,
00:23:02.330,00:23:03.410,那些宫人和太医,,,
00:23:03.880,00:23:05.160,倒是也未尝不可,00:23:01.210,00:23:06.119,"It would have been possible for her to bribe
the servants and doctors on duty."
00:23:06.420,00:23:07.160,夺位,,,
00:23:08.420,00:23:09.210,争宠,00:23:07.420,00:23:09.005,Usurpation...
00:23:10.590,00:23:11.300,丧子,00:23:09.420,00:23:10.789,fighting for favor...
00:23:12.760,00:23:14.050,如果真是她干的,00:23:11.600,00:23:13.057,destroying the child!
00:23:14.430,00:23:16.260,那么是她杀了纯元皇后和皇子,00:23:13.614,00:23:15.258,"If she did this,"
,,,00:23:15.258,00:23:17.752,"she was the one who murdered
Empress Première and the prince!"
00:23:17.890,00:23:20.180,可是咱们没有证据呀,00:23:18.800,00:23:21.180,But... we don't have any evidence.
00:23:20.440,00:23:21.180,一定会有的,00:23:21.180,00:23:23.040,There must be evidence!
00:23:22.150,00:23:24.930,安陵容在皇后身边这么久,00:23:23.150,00:23:26.129,An Lingrong was by the Empress's side for a long time.
00:23:25.650,00:23:27.060,她的心思最为细密,,,
00:23:28.280,00:23:29.770,她一定是看出了什么,00:23:26.393,00:23:30.772,"She had a most meticulous mind:
she must have discovered something."
00:23:30.400,00:23:33.320,要不然她断不能说出这样的话,00:23:31.400,00:23:34.560,"Otherwise, she would never say such a thing."
00:23:33.660,00:23:34.320,未必,00:23:34.660,00:23:36.160,Not necessarily.
00:23:35.620,00:23:38.530,或许是我们多心了也未可知啊,00:23:36.537,00:23:39.840,We don't know if we're just overthinking.
00:23:41.420,00:23:44.120,我和你一样恨极了她,00:23:42.206,00:23:45.467,I abhor her just as much as you do.
00:23:45.170,00:23:46.200,然而再恨,,,
00:23:47.300,00:23:49.910,如果我们不能一击将敌人击倒时,00:23:46.071,00:23:51.480,"Nonetheless, if we cannot knock the enemy down in one blow,"
00:23:50.670,00:23:52.340,只能极力地忍耐,00:23:51.595,00:23:53.864,we must endure with all our patience.
00:23:58.020,00:24:00.510,胧月 你怎么在这儿啊,00:23:59.020,00:24:01.553,"Longyue, why are you here?"
00:24:01.270,00:24:03.550,额娘 我困了,00:24:02.270,00:24:04.480,"Mother, I'm tired."
00:24:09.650,00:24:11.690,好了好了 我们一会儿就回去,00:24:10.393,00:24:12.819,"All right, we'll go in a moment."
00:24:16.080,00:24:17.860,此事还须从长计议,00:24:16.866,00:24:19.054,This requires a long-term plan.
00:24:18.830,00:24:20.110,谁也不得大意,00:24:19.680,00:24:21.280,We cannot be careless.
00:24:27.380,00:24:28.740,额娘怎么了,00:24:28.200,00:24:30.000,"Mother, what happened?"
00:24:31.760,00:24:32.590,没事,,,
00:24:33.510,00:24:35.300,额娘是看你熹娘娘,00:24:32.720,00:24:34.211,Don't worry.
00:24:35.590,00:24:37.180,现在怀孕怀得实在辛苦,00:24:34.400,00:24:38.080,"I'm just thinking about how difficult this
pregnancy is for your mother Lumière."
00:24:37.930,00:24:39.300,吃不了 睡不着的,00:24:38.800,00:24:40.740,She cannot eat much or sleep well.
00:24:40.220,00:24:41.510,真是难受得紧,00:24:41.160,00:24:42.900,It's so hard for her.
00:24:42.390,00:24:45.310,我看别的娘娘有孕也是这样啊,00:24:43.240,00:24:46.480,But I see other pregnant ladies like that too.
00:24:48.320,00:24:50.230,胧月 你知道吗,00:24:49.320,00:24:51.640,"Longyue, did you know"
00:24:50.860,00:24:52.400,你熹娘娘在怀你的时候,,,
00:24:52.700,00:24:53.680,吃了不少的苦,00:24:51.743,00:24:55.182,"your mother Lumière endured many hardships
when she was pregnant with you?"
00:24:54.610,00:24:56.400,现在日子刚刚好过一点,,,
00:24:56.990,00:24:57.900,又怀孕了,00:24:55.600,00:24:59.031,"Her days were getting a little better,
when she became pregnant again."
00:24:58.830,00:25:01.070,额娘真的是不忍心啊,00:24:59.760,00:25:02.070,I don't have the heart to watch her suffer.
00:25:03.460,00:25:05.990,那我晚上去向熹娘娘请安,00:25:04.320,00:25:06.990,Then I'll pay my respects to Her Highness in the evening.
00:25:07.460,00:25:08.320,好,,,
00:25:08.710,00:25:11.450,熹娘娘看见胧月一定会开心的,00:25:08.460,00:25:12.492,Good. She'll be so happy to see you.
00:25:12.510,00:25:14.170,我也要额娘高兴,,,
00:25:14.510,00:25:16.460,皇阿玛老陪着熹娘娘,00:25:13.510,00:25:15.510,"I want to make you happy too, Mother."
00:25:16.760,00:25:17.970,我就多陪着额娘,00:25:15.510,00:25:19.078,"Imperial Father is always with Her Highness,
so I will spend more time with you."
00:25:22.180,00:25:23.140,胧月真乖,,,
00:25:24.020,00:25:24.800,不过,00:25:23.000,00:25:24.672,What a good girl.
00:25:25.440,00:25:26.970,你熹娘娘越是得宠,00:25:25.020,00:25:28.243,"But the more favor your mother Lumière gains,"
00:25:27.860,00:25:29.190,越是有人要害她,00:25:28.734,00:25:30.690,the more someone will want to harm her.
00:25:29.690,00:25:32.310,所以胧月 答应额娘一件事,00:25:30.690,00:25:33.600,"Therefore, Longyue, you need to promise me one thing."
00:25:33.320,00:25:34.680,无论在什么时候,,,
00:25:35.240,00:25:36.650,你都要保护熹娘娘,00:25:34.320,00:25:37.867,"Regardless of the situation,
you must protect your mother Lumière."
00:25:37.490,00:25:39.100,别让皇额娘欺负了她,00:25:38.320,00:25:40.720,Don't let your Imperial Mother take advantage of her.
00:25:39.950,00:25:42.780,这话额娘说过多次 我都记得,00:25:40.800,00:25:43.800,"Mother, you've said this many times. I won't forget."
00:25:58.090,00:26:00.080,卫太医 我们娘娘这是怎么了,,,
00:26:00.180,00:26:01.130,吃什么吐什么,00:25:59.090,00:26:01.269,"Doctor Wei, what is the matter with Her Highness?"
00:26:01.430,00:26:02.390,晚上又睡不好,00:26:01.269,00:26:03.880,"She vomits anything she eats, and cannot sleep well."
00:26:02.970,00:26:04.010,这是怎么回事啊,,,
00:26:04.770,00:26:05.600,娘娘请息怒,00:26:03.970,00:26:05.560,What's happening?
00:26:06.190,00:26:06.920,微臣无能,00:26:05.600,00:26:08.320,May Your Highness calm your anger over my incompetence.
00:26:07.730,00:26:09.340,我看还是速速请温太医来,00:26:08.400,00:26:10.640,I would recommend bringing in Doctor Wen immediately.
00:26:09.860,00:26:11.940,此胎也许还能保得住,00:26:10.720,00:26:13.000,He may be able to save this pregnancy.
,,,00:26:23.961,00:26:25.508,[Eternal]
00:26:29.540,00:26:32.330,娘娘 永寿宫请了温实初回来,00:26:30.540,00:26:33.731,"Your Majesty, the Palace of Eternal Longevity
has brought in Dr. Wen Shichu."
00:26:34.590,00:26:36.870,是不是熹贵妃的胎有不妥,00:26:35.590,00:26:37.960,"Is there something wrong with
Noble Consort Lumière’s pregnancy?"
00:26:37.760,00:26:39.000,永寿宫的口风最紧,,,
00:26:39.260,00:26:40.170,什么也打探不出来,00:26:38.760,00:26:41.720,"The Palace of Eternal Longevity has tightly sealed  lips.
We can't get any information from them."
00:26:40.800,00:26:42.760,不过奴婢向太医院问,00:26:41.800,00:26:43.803,"But when I inquired at the Imperial Infirmary,"
00:26:43.060,00:26:44.040,说是暂无大碍,00:26:43.803,00:26:45.469,they said all has been well.
00:26:45.770,00:26:47.680,连温实初都请回来了,00:26:46.770,00:26:48.680,Yet they have brought in Wen Shichu.
00:26:48.230,00:26:50.310,可见她多重视这一胎呀,00:26:49.230,00:26:51.360,This pregnancy must be so important to her.
00:26:51.400,00:26:53.310,三月十八是先帝的生辰,00:26:52.400,00:26:54.536,"The anniversary of the prior emperor's birth
is the 8th day of the 3rd month."
00:26:53.610,00:26:54.520,你都准备好了吗,,,
00:26:54.730,00:26:56.100,皇上是最重孝道的,00:26:54.536,00:26:55.730,Is everything ready?
,,,00:26:55.730,00:26:57.100,His Majesty especially values filial piety.
00:26:56.940,00:26:59.440,已经盼咐了大师诵经七天七夜,00:26:57.940,00:27:00.740,"I've asked the monks to chant and pray for seven days and nights,"
00:26:59.740,00:27:00.820,而且手抄佛经,00:27:00.740,00:27:02.469,and to handwrite copies of sutras
00:27:01.280,00:27:03.490,在先帝生辰之日焚化祝祷,00:27:02.469,00:27:04.490,to be burned on that day for good wishes.
00:27:04.080,00:27:05.280,皇上是孝子,00:27:05.080,00:27:06.733,"His Majesty is a filial son,"
00:27:05.950,00:27:08.320,皇上的儿子自然也是孝子,00:27:06.950,00:27:09.320,and so is his own son.
00:27:09.410,00:27:11.500,三阿哥那边都妥当了吗,00:27:10.410,00:27:12.500,Is everything ready with the Third Prince?
00:27:11.880,00:27:13.210,已经按娘娘的盼咐,,,
00:27:13.590,00:27:15.450,三阿哥写诗进献给皇上,00:27:14.590,00:27:16.844,The Third Prince will present his poem to His Majesty.
00:27:16.260,00:27:18.120,想来有这么多日的准备,,,
00:27:18.340,00:27:19.630,皇上一定龙心大悦,00:27:17.260,00:27:19.340,"With so many days of effort,"
00:27:20.720,00:27:22.130,阿哥们素日的孝心,00:27:19.340,00:27:21.230,I'm sure the Emperor will be pleased.
00:27:22.390,00:27:23.550,都只在请安上,00:27:21.720,00:27:23.390,The princes usually show their filial hearts
00:27:24.890,00:27:26.050,先帝生辰之日,00:27:23.390,00:27:25.322,merely by paying respects.
00:27:26.350,00:27:27.960,皇上孺慕之情最重,00:27:25.890,00:27:28.800,"Every anniversary His Majesty is
engrossed in filial remembrance."
00:27:28.350,00:27:29.840,一定最容易被打动,00:27:29.050,00:27:31.040,His heart will be touched easily;
00:27:30.520,00:27:32.980,三阿哥只消稍稍准备就好,00:27:31.520,00:27:34.131,the Third Prince won't need to prepare much.
00:27:33.610,00:27:34.260,对了,00:27:34.440,00:27:35.520,"By the way,"
00:27:34.480,00:27:37.220,三阿哥的文采平日并不出众,00:27:35.520,00:27:38.400,the Third Prince is not the most talented writer.
00:27:37.610,00:27:39.470,记得让师傅们好好指点,00:27:38.610,00:27:40.990,Remember to ask the teachers to assist him.
00:27:39.990,00:27:41.400,王师傅博学鸿儒,00:27:40.990,00:27:42.740,His shifu Wang is educated and knowledgeable.
00:27:41.740,00:27:43.770,是皇上钦点教导三阿哥的,00:27:42.740,00:27:45.000,He was assigned to the Third Prince by His Majesty personally.
00:27:44.450,00:27:47.160,可见皇上对咱们三阿哥多器重啊,00:27:45.450,00:27:48.240,This shows His Majesty's high regard for the Third Prince.
00:27:47.540,00:27:48.490,但愿如此,00:27:48.240,00:27:49.774,I hope so.
00:27:49.200,00:27:50.910,三阿哥是皇上的长子,00:27:50.000,00:27:51.996,He is the eldest son.
00:27:51.210,00:27:52.990,皇上难免会寄予厚望,00:27:51.996,00:27:54.280,His Majesty naturally holds great expectations for him.
00:27:53.580,00:27:55.170,只是瑛贵人之死,00:27:54.360,00:27:56.654,But Lady Lustré died...
00:27:55.880,00:27:58.340,到底还是会连累了三阿哥,00:27:56.654,00:27:59.520,this incident could implicate the Third Prince after all.
00:27:59.590,00:28:01.050,本宫会想个法子,,,
00:28:01.300,00:28:04.130,悄悄联络朝中重臣为三阿哥说话,00:28:00.456,00:28:05.061,"I will secretly contrive for high-status officials
to speak on his behalf."
00:28:04.550,00:28:06.840,届时望他得人望,00:28:05.397,00:28:07.826,"Others will follow and he will gain public support,"
00:28:07.060,00:28:08.640,让皇上放心立他为储,00:28:07.826,00:28:09.920,earning His Majesty's trust and becoming the heir apparent.
00:28:09.520,00:28:11.970,有娘娘在一切自然无碍,00:28:10.520,00:28:12.970,He will. Nothing will hinder Your Majesty.
00:28:17.650,00:28:19.260,娘娘 温太医来了,00:28:18.650,00:28:20.260,"Your Highness, Dr Wen is here."
00:28:25.700,00:28:26.980,熹贵妃娘娘万安,00:28:26.700,00:28:28.800,Peace and grace to Your Noble Highness.
00:28:29.830,00:28:30.530,娘娘,,,
00:28:31.500,00:28:33.110,您的脸色怎么如此青白,00:28:30.830,00:28:32.500,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:28:32.500,00:28:34.582,why do you look so pale?
00:28:35.500,00:28:36.540,不到万不得已,00:28:36.243,00:28:38.375,I would not have troubled you
00:28:37.790,00:28:39.000,我也不愿打扰你,00:28:38.790,00:28:40.583,except as a last resort.
00:28:45.140,00:28:45.840,娘娘请,00:28:45.711,00:28:47.183,"Please, Your Highness."
00:29:05.740,00:29:06.520,娘娘,00:29:06.740,00:29:08.360,"Your Highness,"
00:29:07.700,00:29:09.530,我相信卫临已经尽力了,00:29:08.700,00:29:10.719,I believe that Dr. Wei Lin has done his utmost.
00:29:11.370,00:29:12.740,从娘娘的脉象上看,,,
00:29:13.290,00:29:14.400,卫临一早就发觉,00:29:12.370,00:29:13.920,"Based on your pulse,"
00:29:14.920,00:29:15.870,娘娘的胎像,00:29:14.000,00:29:16.162,"at this early stage, Wei Lin has detected"
00:29:16.290,00:29:17.870,倒比寻常人虚弱很多,00:29:16.162,00:29:17.532,that your pregnancy
00:29:18.960,00:29:20.830,所以一直用黄荒和白术,00:29:17.532,00:29:19.071,is more frail than normal.
00:29:21.380,00:29:22.920,那些温补的药,00:29:19.960,00:29:23.927,"So he has been using warm, stabilizing herbs
like huangqi and baizhu"
00:29:23.260,00:29:24.460,为娘娘补养身子,00:29:24.260,00:29:25.974,to nurture Your Highness's health.
00:29:25.970,00:29:26.710,只可惜,,,
00:29:26.970,00:29:27.800,可惜什么,00:29:26.840,00:29:27.970,But unfortunately...
00:29:29.390,00:29:30.470,娘娘刚刚怀孕,00:29:27.970,00:29:29.443,What is it?
00:29:31.060,00:29:33.170,便心气躁动 五内郁结,00:29:30.390,00:29:32.060,"At the beginning of Your Highness's pregnancy,"
00:29:34.850,00:29:36.340,加之娘娘怀孕的时候,00:29:32.060,00:29:34.472,your heart was fretful and the qi of your organs was stagnant.
00:29:37.230,00:29:39.060,当年产下双生子的虚亏,00:29:35.850,00:29:40.226,"On top of that, giving birth to the twins caused a depletion of qi,"
00:29:39.520,00:29:40.480,并没有补回来,,,
00:29:41.070,00:29:42.560,并不是怀孕的好时机,00:29:40.480,00:29:42.070,which had not yet recovered.
,,,00:29:42.070,00:29:44.082,It was not a good time for conception.
00:29:43.610,00:29:47.350,所以即便尽心补救也回天无力,00:29:44.610,00:29:48.350,"So even if I try my utmost, I cannot turn the tide."
00:29:47.820,00:29:50.240,龙胎只能是能保多久是多久,00:29:48.820,00:29:51.240,You can only keep the heir for as long as Heaven allows.
00:29:51.410,00:29:52.620,你告诉我一句实话,00:29:52.410,00:29:54.306,I need the truth.
00:29:54.450,00:29:57.410,这孩子我还能保多久,00:29:55.450,00:29:58.410,How much longer can I keep my baby?
00:29:58.750,00:30:00.290,娘娘已经怀胎四个月,00:29:59.750,00:30:02.190,Your Highness has had this child for four months.
00:30:01.880,00:30:02.740,这个孩子,,,
00:30:03.590,00:30:05.920,即便我和卫临拼尽一身医术,00:30:02.880,00:30:06.968,"Even if Wei Lin and I exhaust all our medical skills,"
00:30:07.590,00:30:09.800,也保他不过五个月,00:30:08.477,00:30:11.040,the baby will not survive the fifth month.
00:30:10.640,00:30:11.380,五个月,,,
00:30:11.760,00:30:12.470,是,00:30:11.640,00:30:12.760,The fifth month?
00:30:17.350,00:30:18.760,那我们的母子情分,00:30:12.760,00:30:13.779,Yes.
00:30:20.230,00:30:21.060,岂非,00:30:18.350,00:30:20.668,Then my remaining time with my baby
00:30:22.480,00:30:24.060,只剩下不到一个月了,00:30:21.536,00:30:25.148,is less than one month?
00:30:25.570,00:30:26.180,娘娘,,,
00:30:27.780,00:30:28.480,娘娘,00:30:26.570,00:30:28.037,"Your Highness,"
00:30:29.360,00:30:30.900,娘娘 娘娘 您身子要紧,00:30:28.780,00:30:30.000,"Your Highness,"
,,,00:30:30.340,00:30:32.500, Your Highness's health takes priority.
00:30:31.990,00:30:34.280,娘娘 您还会再有孩子的,00:30:32.990,00:30:35.280,"Your Highness will have
another baby in the future."
00:30:34.790,00:30:35.700,身子要紧啊,,,
00:30:37.210,00:30:38.290,这件事,00:30:35.790,00:30:37.257,Please take care of your health.
00:30:40.250,00:30:41.580,不许对任何人说,00:30:38.210,00:30:42.459,Tell absolutely no one about this.
00:30:43.670,00:30:45.790,你和卫临只要尽力保住这个孩子,00:30:44.670,00:30:47.128,You and Wei Lin will do whatever you can
00:30:47.800,00:30:49.260,能保多久是多久,00:30:48.800,00:30:50.891,to keep my baby as long as possible.
00:30:51.680,00:30:52.880,我怀孕后的药方,00:30:52.680,00:30:54.880,Wei Lin always keeps two copies
00:30:55.100,00:30:56.680,卫临一向是做两份的,00:30:56.100,00:30:58.709,of the prescriptions for my pregnancy.
00:30:59.140,00:31:00.680,一份在太医院存档,00:31:00.140,00:31:02.480,One is archived in the Imperial Infirmary;
00:31:01.480,00:31:02.340,一份在我这儿,00:31:02.480,00:31:03.983,the other copy is here.
00:31:03.610,00:31:04.640,你那里也是一样,00:31:04.610,00:31:06.026,You should do the same.
00:31:06.070,00:31:06.730,还有,00:31:07.070,00:31:08.320,"In addition,"
00:31:09.490,00:31:11.150,你要提前备好一副,00:31:10.233,00:31:12.407,prepare a formula in advance
00:31:12.660,00:31:14.400,送走这孩子的汤药,00:31:13.660,00:31:15.400,to let this child go.
00:31:16.830,00:31:17.940,或许有一天,00:31:17.830,00:31:19.510,"Maybe one day,"
00:31:20.420,00:31:22.370,这孩子能帮我一个大忙,00:31:21.420,00:31:23.636,this baby will bestow me a favor.
00:31:26.760,00:31:27.540,我明白了,00:31:27.503,00:31:29.055,I see.
00:31:29.510,00:31:31.120,只要不伤害到娘娘的身体,00:31:30.510,00:31:32.573,"As long as it doesn't endanger Your Highnss's health,"
00:31:32.140,00:31:33.340,让我做任何事情,00:31:33.140,00:31:34.491,I will do
00:31:34.180,00:31:35.040,我都会去做,00:31:35.180,00:31:36.812,anything you ask.
00:31:37.560,00:31:39.890,我乏了 你回去吧,00:31:38.560,00:31:40.890,"I am fatigued, you may leave now."
00:31:41.520,00:31:43.140,好 我去配药,00:31:42.520,00:31:44.221,"Yes, I will go prepare the medicine."
00:31:44.820,00:31:47.020,近日三阿哥在书房行走,00:31:45.883,00:31:48.230,"The Third Prince started assisting at Shang Shu Fang
[an academy for the princes]."
00:31:47.230,00:31:48.140,一切都还好吗,,,
00:31:48.490,00:31:49.190,都还好,00:31:48.230,00:31:49.490,Is everything all right?
,,,00:31:49.490,00:31:50.801,All is well.
00:31:49.990,00:31:53.320,三阿哥为人谨慎 尊师重道,00:31:50.990,00:31:54.320,The Third Prince is prudent and respectful to his teachers.
00:31:53.870,00:31:56.320,这孩子是老实些 心却不坏,00:31:54.870,00:31:57.749,"The boy is a bit simple-minded, but has a good heart."
00:31:57.700,00:31:58.940,昨儿还跟朕说,00:31:58.700,00:32:00.580,"Yesterday, he told me that"
00:31:59.580,00:32:02.450,想要好好操办先帝生辰的礼仪,00:32:00.580,00:32:03.676,"he wanted to arrange a grand ceremony for
the prior emperor's birth anniversary."
00:32:03.080,00:32:04.450,确是还有孝心,00:32:04.080,00:32:05.738,He is filial indeed.
00:32:05.040,00:32:06.120,皇上说得是,00:32:06.040,00:32:07.720,I agree with Your Majesty.
00:32:06.800,00:32:09.380,三阿哥除了在书房 素日还去哪里,00:32:07.800,00:32:10.380,"Where else does he normally visit, aside from Shang Shu Fang?"
00:32:10.130,00:32:11.620,除了书房和王府,00:32:11.130,00:32:13.130,"Aside from the academy and his own estate,"
00:32:12.130,00:32:15.130,三阿哥也喜欢与宫里朝臣,00:32:13.130,00:32:17.413,"The Third Prince also likes to discuss
state affairs with the court officials."
00:32:15.470,00:32:16.460,讨论国事,,,
00:32:17.060,00:32:18.390,想为皇上分忧,00:32:17.834,00:32:19.880,He hopes to share Your Majesty’s burdens.
00:32:19.020,00:32:20.470,你见了弘时师傅,00:32:20.020,00:32:21.930,"When you see Hongshi's tutor,"
00:32:20.930,00:32:22.420,也该让他提点弘时,00:32:21.930,00:32:23.680,ask him to inform Hongshi
00:32:22.890,00:32:25.060,先帝在时便没有这样的规矩,00:32:23.890,00:32:26.060,"there has been no such custom
since the prior emperor's reign."
00:32:26.020,00:32:26.680,是,00:32:27.020,00:32:28.097,Yes.
00:32:27.860,00:32:29.600,臣还有一事启奏,00:32:28.860,00:32:30.940,"Your Majesty, I have another topic to address."
00:32:30.280,00:32:32.270,既为先帝祈福祭祀,00:32:31.280,00:32:33.780,"Since there is a ritual to pray for the prior emperor,"
00:32:32.780,00:32:34.270,就应该先行准备好,,,
00:32:34.490,00:32:36.280,祭祀先帝的景陵,00:32:33.780,00:32:37.280,we need to prepare the prior emperor's mausoleum.
00:32:36.830,00:32:39.530,不知道皇上是否亲自前往,00:32:37.830,00:32:40.530,Does Your Majesty want to visit it personally?
00:32:40.200,00:32:42.870,朕近日总觉得疲倦,00:32:41.200,00:32:43.870,I have been feeling tired recently.
00:32:43.750,00:32:46.290,宫中皇后凤体又不安康,00:32:44.750,00:32:47.290,The Empress is also unwell.
00:32:46.840,00:32:48.450,还是让皇子代去吧,00:32:47.840,00:32:49.563,Send a prince on my behalf.
00:32:49.090,00:32:52.080,请旨 不知道是哪位皇子,00:32:50.090,00:32:53.080,May I request Your Majesty's decree on which prince will be sent?
00:32:53.090,00:32:56.170,臣好着礼部先行安排,00:32:54.090,00:32:57.170,So I can arrange with the Ministry of Rites.
00:32:56.470,00:32:57.180,不急,,,
00:32:58.430,00:32:59.840,朕定下了就告诉你,00:32:57.396,00:32:58.838,There is no haste.
00:33:00.640,00:33:01.430,你跪安吧,00:32:59.430,00:33:01.520,You'll know when I make a decision.
,,,00:33:01.640,00:33:03.000,You may leave now.
00:33:02.100,00:33:05.470,臣遵旨,00:33:03.100,00:33:06.899,I will obey Your Majesty's decree.
00:33:07.860,00:33:08.560,苏培盛,00:33:08.860,00:33:10.406,Su Peisheng.
00:33:12.400,00:33:13.060,奴才在,,,
00:33:13.360,00:33:14.230,去永寿宫,00:33:13.400,00:33:14.360,Your Majesty.
00:33:15.070,00:33:16.440,朕去看看熹贵妃,00:33:14.360,00:33:16.070,I'll go to the Palace of Eternal Longevity
00:33:16.740,00:33:17.320,嗻,00:33:16.070,00:33:17.740,to visit Noble Consort Lumière.
,,,00:33:17.740,00:33:18.720,Yes.
00:33:19.370,00:33:20.860,摆驾永寿宫,00:33:20.370,00:33:22.632,His Majesty is departing for the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:33:32.710,00:33:33.450,娘娘,00:33:33.496,00:33:34.800,"Your Noble Highness,"
00:33:33.800,00:33:35.710,温太医把您要的滑胎药送来了,00:33:34.800,00:33:36.852,Dr. Wen brought the abortifacient herbs you requested.
00:33:36.380,00:33:37.210,他嘱咐说,00:33:37.380,00:33:38.970,He told me that
00:33:37.970,00:33:40.260,这药一喝下去 即刻就会发作,00:33:38.970,00:33:41.637,"this medicine takes effect
immediately after you consume it."
00:33:42.640,00:33:43.350,知道了,00:33:43.383,00:33:44.950,I understand.
00:33:47.650,00:33:48.850,娘娘 皇上快过来了,,,
00:33:49.060,00:33:50.050,您准备着接驾吧,00:33:48.350,00:33:50.000,"Your Highness, His Majesty will be here soon."
,,,00:33:50.000,00:33:51.466,Please get ready.
00:33:51.690,00:33:53.020,我的妆看不出破绽吧,00:33:52.390,00:33:54.149,Does my makeup look passable?
00:33:53.400,00:33:55.940,皇上驾到 好着呢,00:33:54.400,00:33:56.940,"- His Majesty the Emperor.
- It looks good."
00:34:02.120,00:34:03.070,给皇上请安,00:34:02.906,00:34:04.542,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:34:08.120,00:34:09.330,朕忙于政务,00:34:08.863,00:34:10.880,I have been busy with state affairs.
00:34:09.880,00:34:12.240,怎么两日不见 你便这样憔悴了,00:34:10.880,00:34:13.240,"You look even more gaunt
than when I saw you two days ago."
00:34:13.800,00:34:14.910,臣妾憔悴,,,
00:34:15.920,00:34:18.130,都是被肚子里这个调皮鬼给闹的,00:34:14.800,00:34:19.120,It's all because of this naughty child in my belly.
00:34:19.090,00:34:19.880,皇上不知道,,,
00:34:20.720,00:34:22.800,昨夜他在臣妾肚子里,00:34:20.090,00:34:21.720,Your Majesty didn't know
00:34:23.060,00:34:24.010,折腾了一晚上,00:34:21.720,00:34:24.960,how he was tossing around in my belly all night.
00:34:24.470,00:34:25.590,臣妾都没睡好,,,
00:34:25.930,00:34:27.640,这个孩子这样活泼好动,00:34:25.470,00:34:26.930,I didn't sleep well.
,,,00:34:26.930,00:34:29.084,"This child is so active and playful,"
00:34:28.310,00:34:30.550,必定是个身子强健的皇子,00:34:29.310,00:34:31.550,he must be a healthy prince.
00:34:31.690,00:34:33.850,往后你再睡不着就告诉朕,00:34:32.690,00:34:34.724,"In the future, let me know if you can't sleep."
00:34:34.110,00:34:34.850,朕来陪你,,,
00:34:35.990,00:34:37.190,皇上国事繁忙,00:34:34.724,00:34:36.536,You'll have my company.
00:34:37.610,00:34:38.730,臣妾怎敢打扰,00:34:36.990,00:34:38.396,"Your Majesty is busy with state affairs,"
00:34:38.950,00:34:40.230,皇嗣也是国事啊,00:34:38.396,00:34:39.650,I dare not disturb your sleep.
00:34:40.950,00:34:42.860,朕希望你们母子平安,00:34:39.650,00:34:41.573,The imperial heir is also a state affair.
,,,00:34:41.950,00:34:44.503,I want you both to be safe and sound.
00:34:45.750,00:34:48.360,朕有一件事要跟你商量,00:34:46.750,00:34:49.360,I have something to discuss with you.
00:34:50.080,00:34:50.740,什么,,,
00:34:51.080,00:34:52.040,先帝生辰,00:34:50.866,00:34:51.720,What is it?
,,,00:34:52.080,00:34:53.455,"For the prior emperor's birth anniversary,"
00:34:52.920,00:34:56.040,朕打算让一个皇子代朕前去祭祀,00:34:53.920,00:34:57.040,"I want to send a prince to perform
the ceremony on my behalf."
00:34:56.550,00:34:58.040,你看谁比较合适,00:34:57.550,00:34:59.342,Who do you think is most suitable?
00:34:59.130,00:35:00.470,论长幼尊卑,00:35:00.130,00:35:01.696,"In terms of both age and status,"
00:35:01.300,00:35:03.210,都该是三阿哥前往最合适,00:35:02.300,00:35:04.399,the Third Prince is the most suitable candidate.
00:35:03.890,00:35:06.630,朕何尝不知道是弘时合适,00:35:04.890,00:35:07.856,I certainly know that Hongshi is the most appropriate one.
00:35:07.850,00:35:09.760,弘历和弘瞻出生前,,,
00:35:10.100,00:35:11.810,朕就只有他这一个儿子,00:35:08.850,00:35:12.800,He was my only son before Hongli and Hongyan were born.
00:35:12.650,00:35:14.230,如何能不寄予厚望,00:35:13.650,00:35:15.494,Naturally I had high expectations of him.
00:35:14.860,00:35:18.350,只是这孩子胆气不足 昏懦有余,00:35:15.860,00:35:19.350,"However, the boy is obtuse and faint-hearted,"
00:35:19.200,00:35:21.530,如今竟私下结交大臣,00:35:20.200,00:35:22.880,and has even been associating with officials privately.
00:35:22.370,00:35:23.950,岂不知先帝晚年,,,
00:35:24.200,00:35:25.440,正是因为诸皇子,00:35:23.370,00:35:24.950,"During the final years of the prior emperor's reign,"
00:35:25.740,00:35:27.450,私交大臣 意图皇位,00:35:24.950,00:35:26.740,there was great chaos
,,,00:35:26.740,00:35:29.080,because many princes associated with officials
00:35:28.080,00:35:29.910,才惹出这许多的是非来,00:35:29.080,00:35:30.910,and plotted to usurp the throne.
00:35:30.460,00:35:32.320,他竟如此不检点,00:35:31.460,00:35:33.320,How could he be so reckless?
00:35:34.000,00:35:35.160,三阿哥还年轻,,,
00:35:35.550,00:35:37.210,做事总有不周到的地方,00:35:35.000,00:35:36.550,The Third Prince is still young.
00:35:37.800,00:35:39.160,皇上告诉他就是了,00:35:36.550,00:35:38.587,Naturally he cannot thoroughly consider his actions.
00:35:39.510,00:35:42.090,这样的话即便朕跟他说了,00:35:38.800,00:35:40.510,Your Majesty can simply point it out to him.
00:35:42.680,00:35:45.010,他也早已有了觊觎皇位之心,00:35:40.510,00:35:43.090,"Even if I instruct him,"
00:35:45.310,00:35:46.040,又有何用,00:35:43.680,00:35:47.040,he already has his heart set on the throne.
00:35:47.020,00:35:49.260,就好像老八允撰,00:35:48.020,00:35:50.260,"Just like Yunsi, the former Eighth Prince."
00:35:50.140,00:35:51.430,皇阿玛在的时候,,,
00:35:51.900,00:35:53.510,如何劝导责骂,00:35:51.140,00:35:54.497,"No matter how our Imperial Father
advised or reprimanded the Eighth Prince,"
00:35:54.310,00:35:55.650,终究是无用的,00:35:55.310,00:35:56.896,it was futile.
00:35:56.110,00:35:57.720,三阿哥不像是这样的人,00:35:56.896,00:35:58.720,The Third Prince is not like that.
00:35:58.570,00:36:00.680,诸皇子中 他最年长,00:35:59.453,00:36:01.906,He is the eldest among the princes.
00:36:01.530,00:36:03.140,难免有自训之心,00:36:02.530,00:36:05.007,"It is inevitable that he thinks of himself
as my successor."
00:36:04.620,00:36:06.530,好啦 朕心里有数,00:36:05.620,00:36:07.530,"All right, I've thought it through."
00:36:07.370,00:36:09.780,你就好好养着身子,00:36:08.370,00:36:10.780,You just take care of your health.
00:36:11.540,00:36:14.780,琼州进贡了一株大珊瑚,00:36:12.540,00:36:15.780,A giant coral has arrived in tribute from Qiongzhou Province.
00:36:15.340,00:36:16.320,很是罕见,00:36:16.340,00:36:17.663,It is very rare.
00:36:17.210,00:36:20.830,藏教视红珊瑚为如来佛的化身,00:36:18.210,00:36:21.830,"Tibetan Buddhism sees red coral
as an embodiment of the Tathāgata Buddha."
00:36:21.260,00:36:23.370,朕想着给你安胎最好,00:36:22.260,00:36:24.370,I think it will bring peace to your pregnancy.
00:36:24.890,00:36:26.050,这么好的珊瑚,00:36:25.890,00:36:27.352,"If it is truly such a marvellous coral,"
00:36:27.140,00:36:29.170,若臣妾一人观赏也可惜了,00:36:28.140,00:36:30.472,it would be a pity if I am the only one to admire it.
00:36:30.480,00:36:33.340,倒不如请合宫嫔妃,00:36:31.480,00:36:34.560,"Why don't I invite all the concubines
to the Palace of Eternal Longevity"
00:36:33.560,00:36:35.100,一起来永寿宫观赏,00:36:34.560,00:36:36.364,to appreciate it together?
00:36:36.190,00:36:37.140,你喜欢就好,00:36:37.190,00:36:38.654,If you like.
00:36:38.610,00:36:39.310,正好,,,
00:36:39.940,00:36:41.230,宝华殿的法师,00:36:39.396,00:36:40.568,It's good timing.
00:36:41.440,00:36:42.600,为臣妾腹中的孩子,00:36:40.940,00:36:42.440,The priests at Baohua Hall
00:36:42.900,00:36:44.060,做了平安符祈福,00:36:42.440,00:36:45.040,made some talismans for my baby.
00:36:44.740,00:36:45.600,法师说了,,,
00:36:45.950,00:36:47.440,要宫中位分最高的人,00:36:45.740,00:36:48.830,They said that these talismans will be effective
00:36:47.830,00:36:49.990,亲手将平安符放入福袋,00:36:48.830,00:36:51.450,if people of the highest status in the harem
00:36:50.450,00:36:51.940,再系在臣妾床头,,,
00:36:52.330,00:36:53.570,才算是功德圆满,00:36:51.450,00:36:53.330,place them in the lucky sachets
00:36:54.210,00:36:56.450,臣妾想 最合适的人,00:36:53.330,00:36:54.910,and fasten them to my bed.
00:36:56.880,00:36:58.330,不外乎是皇后娘娘,00:36:55.210,00:36:57.880,"I think the most appropriate people, of course,"
00:36:58.840,00:37:00.250,皇贵妃 敬贵妃,00:36:57.880,00:37:01.240,"are the Empress, the Imperial Noble Consort,
and Noble Consort Estime."
00:37:00.670,00:37:02.500,再由臣妾亲手系上一个,00:37:01.670,00:37:03.500,And I will tie one myself.
00:37:02.840,00:37:04.080,也算是四角齐全,00:37:03.500,00:37:05.080,That covers the four corners of the bed.
00:37:04.550,00:37:06.130,这是积德积福的事,00:37:05.550,00:37:07.390,This will accumulate Heaven's blessings.
00:37:06.390,00:37:07.630,她们自然不会拒绝,00:37:07.390,00:37:08.630,They surely will not refuse.
00:37:08.300,00:37:09.970,皇后如今不爱出门,00:37:09.300,00:37:11.220,"Her Majesty doesn't go out nowadays,"
00:37:10.220,00:37:11.930,旁人请她都要推托,00:37:11.220,00:37:12.930,and has turned down many invitations.
00:37:12.730,00:37:14.090,可若皇后娘娘不来,00:37:13.730,00:37:15.354,"But if Her Majesty doesn't come,"
00:37:14.600,00:37:16.390,终究也不够圆满,00:37:15.600,00:37:17.692,Heaven's blessing will be incomplete.
00:37:17.560,00:37:20.350,你若喜欢 朕请她们来就是,00:37:18.560,00:37:21.350,"I will invite them, if you'd like that."
00:37:23.990,00:37:26.020,怎么这个时候皇后还没有过来,00:37:24.634,00:37:27.020,Why is the Empress still not here?
00:37:26.410,00:37:27.240,回皇上话,00:37:27.020,00:37:28.240,"Your Majesty,"
00:37:27.780,00:37:29.990,皇后娘娘方才已经派人来过了,00:37:28.780,00:37:30.990,"Her Majesty has already sent someone over,"
00:37:30.410,00:37:32.200,说今日身子不爽,00:37:31.410,00:37:33.620,saying that Her Majesty is not feeling well
00:37:32.620,00:37:33.740,怕是不能过来了,00:37:33.620,00:37:35.042,and may not come today.
00:37:34.460,00:37:37.040,怎么朕请她 她就身子不爽了,00:37:35.460,00:37:38.040,Why does she feel unwell when I invite her?
00:37:37.960,00:37:39.450,或许这永寿宫中,00:37:38.960,00:37:40.840,Maybe there's someone she doesn't want to see
00:37:39.840,00:37:41.450,有皇后不想见的人吧,00:37:40.840,00:37:42.450,in the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:37:42.170,00:37:44.380,所以一见身子就不爽,00:37:43.170,00:37:45.380,So she feels unwell whenever she comes.
00:37:46.590,00:37:47.170,苏培盛,,,
00:37:47.590,00:37:48.170,奴才在,00:37:47.590,00:37:48.590,Su Peisheng.
00:37:48.550,00:37:50.290,你亲自去请皇后过来,00:37:48.590,00:37:49.550,Your Majesty.
00:37:50.680,00:37:51.720,她是六宫之主,00:37:49.550,00:37:51.290,Go invite the Empress yourself.
00:37:52.060,00:37:53.420,这个时候不在 不合适,00:37:51.680,00:37:52.882,She is the head of the harem -
00:37:54.100,00:37:54.680,嗻,00:37:52.882,00:37:54.684,it's inappropriate for her to be absent.
,,,00:37:55.100,00:37:56.437,Yes.
00:37:57.150,00:38:00.260,你们看 这株珊瑚深赤通透,00:37:58.150,00:38:01.260,"Look, this red coral is dark red but translucent."
00:38:00.570,00:38:01.480,世所罕见,00:38:01.570,00:38:02.782,It is such a rarity.
00:38:02.230,00:38:04.770,到底是熹贵妃深受宠爱,00:38:03.230,00:38:05.770,Noble Consort Lumière is in great favor indeed.
00:38:05.320,00:38:07.230,还是皇上想得周到啊,00:38:06.320,00:38:08.230,Your Majesty is very considerate.
00:38:07.910,00:38:09.520,这珊瑚在夜色当中,,,
00:38:09.780,00:38:11.360,显得格外的光彩炤炤,00:38:08.910,00:38:12.360,This coral is even more radiant at night.
00:38:12.080,00:38:15.320,这珊瑚虽难得 究竟还是凡物,00:38:13.080,00:38:16.320,"This coral is rare, but the Heavenly thoughtfulness is rarer."
00:38:15.790,00:38:17.580,皇上看重熹贵妃,00:38:16.790,00:38:19.120,Your Majesty values Noble Consort Lumière
00:38:18.120,00:38:20.790,以珊瑚给熹贵妃安胎祈福,00:38:19.120,00:38:21.790,and bestows this coral to bring luck to her pregnancy.
00:38:21.380,00:38:23.910,臣妾觉得 皇上的心意,,,
00:38:24.170,00:38:26.500,才是让各位姐妹最为感动的呢,00:38:22.380,00:38:27.480,"I think the most touching thing
is Your Majesty's thoughtfulness."
00:38:27.260,00:38:28.000,皇上,00:38:28.260,00:38:29.470,"Your Majesty,"
00:38:28.470,00:38:30.880,皇后娘娘不会生臣妾的气吧,00:38:29.470,00:38:31.880,could Her Majesty be upset with me?
00:38:31.100,00:38:31.750,不会,00:38:31.880,00:38:33.200,She's not.
00:38:32.350,00:38:35.050,她是皇后 应该宽容大度,00:38:33.350,00:38:36.629,"As the Empress, she must be magnanimous."
00:38:37.940,00:38:38.600,娘娘,00:38:38.795,00:38:40.045,"Your Majesty,"
00:38:39.400,00:38:41.060,皇上特地让苏公公来请,00:38:40.400,00:38:42.060,His Majesty sent Mr. Su to invite you.
00:38:41.730,00:38:42.850,娘娘不能不去啊,00:38:42.730,00:38:44.076,Your Majesty has no choice now.
00:38:43.690,00:38:44.560,本宫知道,00:38:44.690,00:38:46.050,I know.
00:38:45.320,00:38:47.900,永寿宫一直想意图对本宫不利,00:38:46.320,00:38:48.900,"The Palace of Eternal Longevity has always
wanted to plot against me."
00:38:49.070,00:38:50.650,这样的是非之地,,,
00:38:50.990,00:38:52.530,本宫根本就不想踏入,00:38:50.070,00:38:53.520,"But I have no intention to step into such a
troublesome place."
00:38:53.160,00:38:55.070,可是娘娘总得顾及皇上啊,00:38:54.160,00:38:56.070,But you have to consider His Majesty.
00:39:02.880,00:39:05.580,皇后娘娘驾到,00:39:03.479,00:39:06.179,Her Majesty the Empress!
00:39:11.970,00:39:14.840,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:39:12.970,00:39:15.840,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:39:16.180,00:39:17.640,臣妾参见皇上,00:39:17.180,00:39:18.640,I respectfully greet Your Majesty.
00:39:18.060,00:39:19.640,愿皇上万福金安,00:39:19.060,00:39:20.640,May Your Majesty have grace and peace.
00:39:20.140,00:39:20.880,快起来吧,,,
00:39:21.440,00:39:22.050,是,00:39:21.140,00:39:22.440,Rise quickly.
00:39:22.860,00:39:23.810,你身子不适,00:39:22.440,00:39:23.584,Yes.
00:39:24.150,00:39:25.730,朕叫你来 勉强你了,00:39:23.860,00:39:25.150,You are in poor health.
00:39:26.110,00:39:26.890,不怪朕吧,00:39:25.150,00:39:27.880,Do you blame me for making you come?
00:39:27.190,00:39:27.900,怎会,,,
00:39:28.610,00:39:30.320,臣妾刚才身体不适,00:39:28.190,00:39:29.343,How could I?
00:39:30.570,00:39:31.810,所以不打算来的,00:39:29.494,00:39:32.806,"I was feeling unwell,
so I wasn't planning on attending."
00:39:32.070,00:39:34.280,但皇上一直惦记熹贵妃,00:39:33.070,00:39:35.724,But Your Majesty has been concerned about Noble Consort  Lumière.
00:39:34.950,00:39:37.530,臣妾同皇上夫妻本为一体,00:39:35.950,00:39:38.530,"As husband and wife, we are of one heart."
00:39:37.790,00:39:39.620,臣妾又怎么会不关心呢,00:39:38.719,00:39:40.620,How could I not care about her?
00:39:40.000,00:39:40.950,之所以来迟,,,
00:39:41.210,00:39:42.620,是因为臣妾到库房,00:39:40.620,00:39:43.771,I'm late because I went to the repository
00:39:42.960,00:39:44.620,去找了一尊送子观音,,,
00:39:44.960,00:39:46.080,送给熹贵妃,00:39:43.960,00:39:47.080,"to find a statue of Guanyin Carrying a Baby
for Noble Consort Lumiere."
00:39:46.710,00:39:49.580,希望熹贵妃能够顺利地产子,00:39:47.710,00:39:50.580,"I hope that Noble Consort Lumiere
 can give birth smoothly."
00:39:50.590,00:39:51.330,江福海,,,
00:39:51.630,00:39:52.290,嗻,00:39:51.590,00:39:52.630,Jiang Fuhai.
00:39:53.140,00:39:54.630,多谢皇后娘娘关怀,00:39:52.630,00:39:53.691,Yes.
00:39:56.060,00:39:58.510,臣妾一定把这尊观音放在寝殿,00:39:54.140,00:39:55.932,I thank Your Majesty for your care.
00:39:58.810,00:39:59.510,日夜敬香,00:39:57.060,00:40:00.480,"I will place this statue of Guanyin
in my chamber and offer incense day and night."
00:40:08.690,00:40:09.770,皇后贤惠,00:40:09.690,00:40:11.349,The Empress is virtuous.
00:40:10.740,00:40:13.440,皇上 臣妾有个不情之请,00:40:11.740,00:40:14.730,"Your Majesty, may I make a bold request?"
00:40:14.070,00:40:15.560,皇后娘娘垂爱六宫,00:40:15.070,00:40:17.120,"Since Her Majesty is so caring towards the harem,"
00:40:16.030,00:40:19.150,这株珊瑚臣妾想借花献佛,,,
00:40:19.580,00:40:21.190,能否赠与皇后娘娘,00:40:17.120,00:40:22.160,"I wish to dedicate my coral to her, like
""offering a borrowed flower to the Buddha"""
00:40:23.120,00:40:26.330,熹贵妃敬爱皇后之心真是难得,00:40:24.120,00:40:27.330,"It is admirable that Noble Consort Lumiere
has such esteem for Her Majesty."
00:40:26.540,00:40:27.620,只是这个珊瑚,,,
00:40:28.210,00:40:30.620,是皇上赐给贵妃安胎的呀,00:40:27.330,00:40:31.449,"It's just that His Majesty gave you this coral
on account of your pregnancy."
00:40:31.050,00:40:32.260,本宫什么都不缺,00:40:31.789,00:40:33.449,I want for nothing.
00:40:32.880,00:40:33.670,熹贵妃,,,
00:40:34.180,00:40:36.130,你就留着那个珊瑚观赏吧,00:40:33.880,00:40:37.120,"Noble Consort Lumiere,
you should keep the coral for your own pleasure."
00:40:36.800,00:40:38.260,千万不要枉费了,,,
00:40:38.560,00:40:40.260,皇上和本宫的心意,00:40:37.800,00:40:41.240,"You must not disappoint the good
intentions of His Majesty and mine."
00:40:41.850,00:40:43.010,皇后娘娘慈爱,,,
00:40:43.480,00:40:45.260,今日臣妾和皇贵妃来,00:40:42.850,00:40:44.312,Your Majesty is benevolent.
00:40:45.650,00:40:48.480,也是为了熹贵妃能早日诞下皇子,00:40:44.480,00:40:46.650,Imperial Noble Consort and I are also here today
00:40:48.780,00:40:49.760,安胎祈福的,00:40:46.650,00:40:51.192,"to pray for Noble Consort Lumiere's
timely delivery of another prince."
00:40:52.860,00:40:53.650,熹贵妃,00:40:53.860,00:40:55.662,"Noble Consort Lumiere,"
00:40:54.910,00:40:56.990,法师的平安符都到了吗,00:40:55.910,00:40:57.990,have the priests delivered the talismans?
00:40:57.580,00:40:58.410,都送来了,00:40:58.402,00:40:59.534,They're here.
00:40:59.240,00:41:00.030,小允子,00:41:00.240,00:41:01.413,Xiao Yunzi?
00:41:01.500,00:41:02.240,娘娘,00:41:02.500,00:41:03.542,Your Highness.
00:41:11.130,00:41:12.340,回禀皇后娘娘,00:41:12.130,00:41:13.340,"Your Majesty,"
00:41:12.970,00:41:13.830,法师说了,00:41:13.970,00:41:15.220,the priests said that
00:41:14.220,00:41:16.630,这平安符和福袋都是吉祥之物,00:41:15.220,00:41:17.630,both the talismans and lucky sachets can bring auspiciousness.
00:41:17.100,00:41:18.800,能够祈祷臣妾腹中的孩子,00:41:18.100,00:41:19.800,They can bless the baby in my belly
00:41:19.060,00:41:19.890,平安康健,00:41:19.800,00:41:21.390,with safety and health.
00:41:20.390,00:41:22.930,只是要劳烦皇后娘娘和两位姐姐,00:41:21.390,00:41:23.930,But I must trouble Your Majesty and my two fellow consorts
00:41:23.140,00:41:25.930,与臣妾一同把这平安符放进福袋,00:41:23.930,00:41:26.930,to help me place the talismans into the sachets
00:41:26.230,00:41:27.470,悬挂在臣妾床头,00:41:26.930,00:41:28.470,and hang them by my bedside.
00:41:28.610,00:41:29.940,举手之劳 是啊,,,
00:41:30.230,00:41:31.020,都是应当的,00:41:29.610,00:41:32.000,"It's as ""easy as lifting our hands."""
00:41:31.570,00:41:33.980,皇上 熹贵妃有孕,00:41:32.570,00:41:35.169,"Your Majesty, Noble Consort Lumiere is pregnant."
00:41:34.650,00:41:37.070,寝殿中自然有胎神镇住,00:41:35.650,00:41:38.070,There is a fetal god guarding her chamber.
00:41:38.200,00:41:39.480,臣妾身体不适,00:41:39.200,00:41:40.593,I am unwell.
00:41:40.280,00:41:43.370,又怕是生人进入寝殿会冲撞胎神,00:41:41.280,00:41:44.600,"And a stranger entering her chambers
will displease the fetal god."
00:41:43.710,00:41:44.740,那就不好了,00:41:44.600,00:41:46.000,That would be thoughtless of me.
00:41:45.000,00:41:47.910,皇贵妃与敬贵妃为了朕的皇嗣,00:41:46.000,00:41:47.742,Imperial Noble Consort and Noble Consort Estime

00:41:50.000,00:41:51.460,你又何必百般推诿,,,
00:41:53.260,00:41:56.460,你执掌凤印 当和睦六宫,00:41:51.000,00:41:54.240,"Why are you making every effort
to shirk your responsibilities?"
00:41:57.090,00:41:59.460,为嫔妃之表率才是,00:41:54.260,00:42:00.846,"You possess the Phoenix Seal:
you must bring harmony to the harem."
00:42:00.680,00:42:02.390,自从熹贵妃有孕之后,00:42:01.680,00:42:03.970,"Since Noble Consort Lumière became pregnant,"
00:42:02.970,00:42:05.090,皇后娘娘就没来过永寿宫,00:42:03.970,00:42:06.090,Her Majesty hasn't visited the Palace of Eternal Longevity.
00:42:05.940,00:42:09.100,皇后娘娘是把自己当生人了吧,00:42:06.940,00:42:10.100,Your Majesty shouldn't see yourself as a stranger.
00:42:09.480,00:42:11.390,以后娘娘多来走动走动,,,
00:42:11.690,00:42:12.480,不就行了吗,00:42:10.480,00:42:13.480,There are no concerns with Your Majesty visiting more often.
00:42:12.860,00:42:14.850,敬贵妃这话说得有理,00:42:13.860,00:42:15.850,Noble Consort Estime is right.
00:42:16.280,00:42:17.140,是,00:42:17.280,00:42:18.140,Yes.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:42.000,00:43:00.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:43:00.000,00:43:20.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:20.000,00:43:37.000,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,
