00:02:22.000,00:02:23.790,只是这件事由你开始,,,
00:02:24.160,00:02:26.430,陵容一开始也不曾牵涉其中,00:02:23.280,00:02:27.840,"But it all started because of you.
Lingrong wasn't involved in this."
00:02:26.960,00:02:29.150,现在却去冷宫,,,
00:02:29.360,00:02:30.910,让人活活勒死余氏,00:02:28.000,00:02:32.280,"Even so, she had Yu strangled in the Cold Palace."
00:02:31.680,00:02:34.270,这举止完全不像她平日,,,
00:02:34.560,00:02:35.830,柔柔弱弱的样子啊,00:02:33.060,00:02:37.560,That is not the sensitive girl I know.
00:02:37.000,00:02:38.510,免子急了也会咬人的,,,
00:02:39.040,00:02:41.550,可是连苏培盛都棘手的事,00:02:38.000,00:02:40.240,Even a cornered rabbit bites.
00:02:41.920,00:02:44.300,陵容却能解决得这么干脆利落,00:02:40.240,00:02:45.700,"But she settled something that
even put Su Peisheng at a loss."
00:02:44.880,00:02:46.870,实在是让我太意外了,00:02:45.700,00:02:48.600,That was very much to my surprise.
00:02:47.640,00:02:48.550,虽然意外,,,
00:02:50.160,00:02:53.110,可陵容毕竟也是为了咱们,00:02:48.600,00:02:54.900,"Lingrong did it for us, regardless."
00:02:53.840,00:02:57.510,话是如此 可是我总还觉得,00:02:54.900,00:02:59.560,"She did, but I can't help thinking"
00:02:58.360,00:03:00.630,这不像我日日面对的那个陵容,00:02:59.560,00:03:02.480,that she's not the person we know.
00:03:14.960,00:03:15.940,死绝了,,,
00:03:16.520,00:03:17.710,死得透透的了,00:03:16.340,00:03:17.660,She's finally dead?
00:03:18.240,00:03:19.750,拉去乱葬岗的时候,00:03:17.660,00:03:19.620,Completely and utterly.
00:03:20.000,00:03:23.190,有人亲眼瞧见 下手可真够狠的,00:03:19.620,00:03:24.540,"Someone saw her corpse
being thrown into the plague pit."
00:03:23.440,00:03:25.820,脖子都勒断了半根 可吓人了,00:03:24.540,00:03:27.380,"Her neck was half torn.
It was so frightful."
00:03:27.400,00:03:29.150,那些没根的东西,,,
00:03:30.040,00:03:32.150,做事倒是挺利落的,00:03:28.420,00:03:33.800,The castrated did know how to use a knife.
00:03:33.360,00:03:34.500,也难怪呀,,,
00:03:34.880,00:03:37.470,她连皇上身边的人都敢得罪,00:03:34.720,00:03:39.400,"But that's not a surprise,
for her offending His Majesty's servants."
00:03:38.120,00:03:39.750,活该她有今天,00:03:39.400,00:03:41.660,It serves her well.
00:03:41.680,00:03:43.030,她没说漏了嘴吧,,,
00:03:43.360,00:03:44.270,一句都没有,00:03:43.160,00:03:44.740,Did she divulge anything?
00:03:46.200,00:03:47.790,算她识相,00:03:44.740,00:03:46.300,Not a single word.
00:03:48.160,00:03:50.990,从前小看了那个病歪歪的甄嬛,00:03:47.640,00:03:49.480,Good for her.
,,,00:03:49.480,00:03:52.640,We underestimated that sickly Zhen Huan.
00:03:52.200,00:03:53.750,以后走着瞧吧,00:03:53.400,00:03:55.460,We'll wait and see.
00:03:57.880,00:03:59.670,且闷了这么些天,,,
00:04:00.520,00:04:02.190,也该下场大雨了,00:03:59.300,00:04:04.060,It's about to rain after all the stuffiness.
00:04:12.000,00:04:12.790,槿汐,00:04:13.000,00:04:14.440,Jinxi.
00:04:19.280,00:04:21.740,小主 怎么不睡了,00:04:20.500,00:04:23.320,"My Lady, what are you awake?"
00:04:22.440,00:04:23.580,我有些害怕,,,
00:04:24.240,00:04:26.430,那些鬼神之说,00:04:23.320,00:04:25.160,I feel alarmed.
00:04:26.720,00:04:28.070,都是世人以讹传讹的,00:04:26.500,00:04:29.660,"The tales of supernatural existence
are simply repeated fictions."
00:04:28.880,00:04:30.350,小主不要放在心上,00:04:29.660,00:04:31.840,Don't take them to heart.
00:04:31.640,00:04:33.310,我不是害怕鬼神之说,00:04:32.740,00:04:35.140,I'm not afraid of ghosts.
00:04:34.600,00:04:35.710,我是害怕,,,
00:04:37.000,00:04:38.670,虽然余氏一命归西,00:04:35.140,00:04:37.620,I'm afraid that ...
00:04:39.400,00:04:42.390,但此事并没有完全了结,00:04:37.620,00:04:44.180,Yu's death does not bring this matter to an end.
00:04:43.520,00:04:44.710,小主是怀疑,,,
00:04:45.400,00:04:47.230,余氏背后另有人指使吧,00:04:45.040,00:04:49.220,"My Lady, do you suspect that
someone else was behind this."
00:04:48.360,00:04:49.340,你细想想,,,
00:04:50.200,00:04:52.150,余氏不像是心计深沉的人,00:04:49.220,00:04:53.720,"With hindsight, Yu was not
a person with a scheming mind."
00:04:53.120,00:04:54.710,她不过一介宫女出身,,,
00:04:55.000,00:04:56.030,怎么会懂得药理,00:04:54.000,00:04:57.560,How did she learn medicine as a maid?
00:04:56.680,00:04:59.030,知道每次在我汤药里下几分药量,,,
00:04:59.360,00:05:00.580,怎么悉心安排人,,,
00:05:00.880,00:05:02.470,在碎玉轩里应外合,00:04:57.560,00:05:03.920,"Not only did she know about the dosage,
but she could also coordinate with my servants."
00:05:03.000,00:05:04.350,那药又是从哪儿来的,,,
00:05:04.760,00:05:05.590,对,00:05:03.920,00:05:05.880,And how did she get the medicine?
00:05:06.480,00:05:08.630,当日小主真应该留下她一个活口,00:05:05.880,00:05:06.980,True.
00:05:09.040,00:05:10.260,细细审问才是,00:05:07.780,00:05:11.840,We should have kept her alive for interrogation.
00:05:11.160,00:05:12.270,她恨我入骨,,,
00:05:13.040,00:05:14.550,不会说出背后指使的,00:05:11.840,00:05:16.020,"She hated me to the marrow.
She wouldn't say a thing."
00:05:15.400,00:05:17.630,甚至会反咬我们攀诬旁人,00:05:16.500,00:05:19.120,She might even accuse us of slander.
00:05:19.080,00:05:20.350,反倒她死了,,,
00:05:20.880,00:05:23.070,主使她的人才会有所松懈,00:05:20.240,00:05:24.720,"Now that she's dead,
the people behind her would lower their guard"
00:05:23.600,00:05:24.910,我们才会有迹可寻,00:05:24.720,00:05:27.040,and we will have a chance to trace them.
00:05:27.440,00:05:30.230,那咱们就拿余氏的死,,,
00:05:30.720,00:05:31.910,来做一出好戏,00:05:28.340,00:05:33.300,"If so, let us put on a show about Yu's death."
00:05:43.960,00:05:45.510,鬼 鬼呀,,,
00:05:45.880,00:05:47.870,鬼,00:05:46.000,00:05:49.000,A  ghost ... A ghost!
00:05:50.240,00:05:50.990,鬼啊 鬼,,,
00:05:52.880,00:05:53.860,还要多久啊,,,
00:05:54.280,00:05:55.070,快到了,00:05:54.000,00:05:55.720,Are we almost home?
00:05:55.320,00:05:57.670,小主在宝华殿诵经祈福了半夜,00:05:55.720,00:05:56.720,"Yes, My Lady."
00:05:57.920,00:05:58.710,的确辛苦,00:05:56.720,00:06:00.260,"My Lady, you must be tired after offering prayers
at the Baohua Hall all night."
00:05:59.520,00:06:01.670,皇后娘娘近日凤体欠佳,,,
00:06:02.040,00:06:04.950,为皇后祈福也是妾妃应尽之礼,00:06:00.800,00:06:06.380,"The Empress has been suffering from cephalalgia.
It is a concubine's duty to wish Her Majesty well."
00:06:12.800,00:06:13.860,谁在哭啊,,,
00:06:14.400,00:06:16.430,听着怪疹人的 快走快走,00:06:14.240,00:06:15.620,Who's crying?
,,,00:06:15.620,00:06:25.920,"It sends chills down my spine.
Go faster!"
00:06:21.600,00:06:22.350,鬼啊,,,
00:06:23.440,00:06:25.310,鬼啊 有鬼,00:06:25.920,00:06:27.600,A ghost ... There's a ghost!
00:06:29.440,00:06:30.310,鬼啊,00:06:30.500,00:06:31.800,A ghost!
00:06:52.160,00:06:53.380,你是真看见了,,,
00:06:54.800,00:06:57.070,贵人姐姐祈福诵经 累了半夜,00:06:53.300,00:06:55.300,Did you really see it?
00:06:57.400,00:06:58.350,会不会眼花了,00:06:55.680,00:06:59.800,"Lady Fuca, you had been praying all night.
Did that cause you sudden blurred vision?"
00:06:58.680,00:07:00.710,你要不信 你问桑儿,00:06:59.800,00:07:02.000,Ask Sang'er if you don't believe me.
00:07:01.160,00:07:02.190,她也看见了,00:07:02.000,00:07:03.700,She saw it too.
00:07:02.840,00:07:05.590,真的 那是女人的头发,00:07:03.860,00:07:07.460,I did ... it was the long hair of a woman
00:07:06.800,00:07:07.710,冰冰凉的,00:07:08.000,00:07:09.800,cold as ice ...
00:07:08.840,00:07:11.140,有腥臭味 是死人味,00:07:09.800,00:07:12.720,and the stench ... of a dead body ...
00:07:12.120,00:07:14.910,你们瞧 桑儿都给吓傻了,00:07:13.360,00:07:16.480,See? Sang'er is scared out of her wits.
00:07:15.800,00:07:17.870,她可是我宫里最伶俐的丫头啊,00:07:16.480,00:07:19.480,She is the smartest maid of mine.
00:07:18.480,00:07:19.190,是,,,
00:07:19.720,00:07:23.550,我刚才听说一个小太监也看见了,00:07:19.480,00:07:24.880,I heard that a eunuch saw it s well.
00:07:24.080,00:07:25.750,活活地吓出一身病来,00:07:25.000,00:07:27.340,Now he looks like death warmed over.
00:07:26.200,00:07:27.470,我真看见了,00:07:27.340,00:07:29.200,I really saw it ...
00:07:28.160,00:07:30.950,穿着白色的衣服 惨白的脸,00:07:29.300,00:07:32.480,in a white dress ... her face pale as death ...
00:07:31.720,00:07:35.340,舌头有那么长 上面还滴着血,00:07:33.000,00:07:37.020,sticking out a long tongue ... with blood dripping ...
00:07:36.200,00:07:37.590,眼睛里也滴着血,00:07:37.020,00:07:39.580,and blood dripping from her eyes too ...
00:07:39.240,00:07:43.020,头发散着 一直哭 一直哭,00:07:40.240,00:07:44.380,Her hair was disarranged ... and she kept crying ...
00:07:43.520,00:07:44.580,她哭得那么惨,,,
00:07:45.000,00:07:46.750,莫非是枉死的女人,00:07:44.380,00:07:48.240,"Is it because she died in grievance
that she kept crying?"
00:07:47.320,00:07:48.710,看你闷不作声的,,,
00:07:48.960,00:07:50.310,说话倒说到点上了,00:07:48.300,00:07:51.780,You do hit the nail on the head when you talk.
00:07:50.720,00:07:53.280,要不是枉死的女人 能半夜哭啊,00:07:51.780,00:07:54.820,Why would she cry around midnight otherwise?
00:07:53.880,00:07:54.990,枉死的女人,00:07:54.820,00:07:57.060,Died in grievance?
00:07:58.480,00:08:01.870,那肯定是那个死在冷宫里的余氏,00:07:59.120,00:08:03.320,(gasp) It must be Yu who died in the Cold Palace.
00:08:02.320,00:08:04.070,余氏的冤魂来索命来了,,,
00:08:04.520,00:08:06.710,别胡说 她是罪该万死,00:08:03.400,00:08:05.560,She turned into a vengeful ghost.
00:08:07.040,00:08:07.950,有什么枉死的,00:08:05.560,00:08:09.460,"Don't say that. She ought to
die a thousand deaths for her offence."
00:08:08.120,00:08:08.990,你知道什么呀,,,
00:08:10.880,00:08:12.190,当时她不肯就死,00:08:09.460,00:08:11.260,What do you know?
00:08:12.520,00:08:13.990,苏公公没法交差了,00:08:12.200,00:08:15.480,"She was resisting suicide
and that was causing trouble to Mr Su."
00:08:14.360,00:08:17.550,拿弓弦把她活活地给勒死了,00:08:15.480,00:08:19.140,So they strangled her with a bowstring.
00:08:19.240,00:08:22.110,后宫这么乱 不如等皇上回来,,,
00:08:22.680,00:08:23.950,我们禀告皇上吧,00:08:20.600,00:08:25.260,"The harem is now in chaos.
Shall we report to His Majesty when he returns?"
00:08:24.200,00:08:25.990,皇上最讨厌鬼神之说了,00:08:25.260,00:08:27.600,His Majesty is averse to superstitions.
00:08:26.440,00:08:28.310,要是你敢 你去说去吧,00:08:27.600,00:08:30.000,You should tell him if you dare to.
00:08:29.120,00:08:31.750,冤有头债有主 我没害她呀,00:08:30.100,00:08:33.160,"""There is a debtor for every debt.""
I owe nothing to her!"
00:08:32.080,00:08:33.470,她来找我做什么,,,
00:08:33.840,00:08:35.670,所以 她没害你呀,00:08:33.160,00:08:34.640,Why did she came to me?
00:08:36.000,00:08:37.190,这不转脸就走了,00:08:34.640,00:08:38.600,"That is why she went away
without doing anything to you."
00:08:37.400,00:08:39.700,否则你还能好好地待在这儿,00:08:38.600,00:08:41.200,"Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here right now."
00:08:40.760,00:08:43.110,那你们说说她会去找谁呀,00:08:41.820,00:08:44.720,"So, who do you think Yu is coming after?"
00:08:44.680,00:08:46.150,反正不关莞姐姐的事,00:08:45.560,00:08:47.660,Not Sourire anyway.
00:08:50.000,00:08:51.670,听说余氏一死,,,
00:08:52.160,00:08:54.510,莞贵人成宿成宿地睡不着,00:08:51.500,00:08:55.700,"I heard that Lady Sourire is
having trouble sleeping after Yu's death."
00:08:54.720,00:08:55.860,太医可曾去看过了,,,
00:08:56.200,00:08:57.070,多谢娘娘关心,00:08:55.700,00:08:57.420,Did she see the doctors?
00:08:57.880,00:08:59.670,温太医已经在救治了,00:08:57.420,00:08:58.880,Thank Your Highness for your concern.
00:09:00.320,00:09:03.390,只是尚未见起色,00:08:58.880,00:09:01.420,Dr Wen has been tending her.
00:09:04.280,00:09:06.510,这几日宫里闹鬼闹得厉害,00:09:01.420,00:09:05.020,But she showed no sign of improvement.
00:09:06.920,00:09:08.710,前后十几个人都见过了,00:09:05.680,00:09:10.080,"The palace is frequented by a ghost.
Over a dozen people have seen it in succession."
00:09:09.520,00:09:10.910,真是日夜不安哪,00:09:10.200,00:09:12.560,We can't go a day without being disturbed.
00:09:11.680,00:09:14.470,我也听说了 太监们都被吓病了,00:09:12.560,00:09:16.020,I heard that a few eunuchs were bed-ridden because of that
00:09:14.960,00:09:16.710,富察贵人连门都不敢出,,,
00:09:17.040,00:09:18.070,皇上说了,00:09:16.020,00:09:18.360,and Lady Fuca doesn't have the nerve to even step out of her chamber.
00:09:18.680,00:09:22.350,鬼神之说只不过是怪力乱神,00:09:18.360,00:09:23.940,"His Majesty believes that ghost stories
are told by the unintelligent minds."
00:09:23.280,00:09:25.550,何况有那么多人见过了,,,
00:09:25.840,00:09:28.630,不过是添油加醋 以讹传讹罢了,00:09:24.640,00:09:30.000,"With so many self-proclaimed witnesses,
the story was relayed through repeated embellishment."
00:09:29.400,00:09:31.960,看来齐妃是太久没见过皇上了,,,
00:09:32.200,00:09:34.190,连皇上的话都不记得了,00:09:30.820,00:09:35.580,"It must have been so long since His Majesty's last visit
that Consort Astuce has forgot what he said."
00:09:34.440,00:09:36.740,娘娘久听圣言自然不怕,,,
00:09:37.160,00:09:39.460,不比咱们经常见不到皇上,00:09:35.580,00:09:38.380,"You Highness gets to see His Majesty frequently,"
00:09:40.200,00:09:42.430,若是常有皇上的福泽相随,00:09:38.380,00:09:41.480,unlike us leading a lonely existence in the palace.
00:09:42.640,00:09:44.550,宫里自然少了这些流言了,00:09:41.480,00:09:45.840,"The rumors wouldn't spread
if we all are as blessed as Your Highness."
00:09:46.160,00:09:49.070,只可惜呀 咱们没这福气罢了,00:09:47.540,00:09:50.840,"Unfortunately, we are not."
00:09:50.400,00:09:53.070,既然没福就自求多福吧,00:09:51.580,00:09:54.880,"Pray for blessing while you can,"
00:09:53.480,00:09:55.670,否则来日那冤魂找上门来,,,
00:09:55.960,00:09:57.070,抱佛脚都不管用,00:09:54.880,00:09:58.980,"or even the Buddha can't save you
when the ghosts comes."
00:09:58.520,00:10:02.110,你们这些人 私下里说得更难听,,,
00:10:02.680,00:10:04.390,满嘴的妖魔鬼怪,00:09:59.920,00:10:06.020,"I don't want to hear the nonsensical stories
that you tell in private ever again."
00:10:04.760,00:10:05.900,本宫倒不相信了,,,
00:10:06.760,00:10:08.270,余氏生前恨谁,00:10:06.020,00:10:08.020,I believe that
00:10:08.520,00:10:10.230,死后自然会去找谁,00:10:08.020,00:10:11.780,Yu will come after who she hated.
00:10:10.680,00:10:12.550,其他人瞎操什么心,,,
00:10:13.240,00:10:14.550,娘娘教诲得是,00:10:11.780,00:10:14.500,How does that concern you?
00:10:14.920,00:10:16.670,余氏又没有人指使,00:10:14.620,00:10:16.140,Thank Your Highness for the advice.
00:10:16.920,00:10:19.070,当然是自己作孽自己遭罪,00:10:16.140,00:10:20.500,Yu ought to reap what she sow.
00:10:19.960,00:10:21.630,若是有人指使的话,,,
00:10:21.840,00:10:24.510,她十成九也要去找那害死她的人,00:10:20.500,00:10:26.080,"But if there was a mastermind behind her,
she is most likely to come after whoever exploited her."
00:10:24.760,00:10:27.630,好好地问问凭什么拿她作刀子使,00:10:26.080,00:10:29.380,She will ask them why they used her as their dagger.
00:10:56.560,00:10:58.150,皇后气色好些了,00:10:57.800,00:11:00.040,Your Majesty looks better today.
00:11:00.840,00:11:02.030,今儿是初一,,,
00:11:02.320,00:11:04.230,是该本宫祭神的日子,00:11:01.500,00:11:05.960,"It is my duty to pray to the Mongolian Gods
on the first day of every month."
00:11:04.800,00:11:08.190,得上苍护佑 本宫自觉得好多了,00:11:05.960,00:11:09.720,I feel much better owing to their blessings.
00:11:08.720,00:11:10.510,皇后病了两日不知道,,,
00:11:11.560,00:11:15.550,后宫里众说纷纭 鬼神之谈盛行,00:11:09.720,00:11:16.880,"Your Majesty might not have been informed that
ghost stories prevailed in the harem lately."
00:11:15.840,00:11:17.870,流言纷扰不足为信,,,
00:11:18.520,00:11:20.350,这紫禁城也几百年了,00:11:16.880,00:11:19.700,Rumors should not be lent credence to.
00:11:20.600,00:11:22.350,什么狐鬼传言没有啊,00:11:19.820,00:11:23.800,"The palace is never short of old wives' tales
for the past centuries."
00:11:22.760,00:11:25.140,要真计较起来 是该做法事了,00:11:23.960,00:11:26.840,"An exorcism should be performed
if people take it seriously."
00:11:26.160,00:11:27.470,这法事一做,,,
00:11:28.240,00:11:30.510,后宫岂不是更信鬼神怪谈了,00:11:27.520,00:11:31.940,"An exorcism?
Wouldn't that convince people of the superstitions?"
00:11:30.840,00:11:33.400,做法事不是相信还是不相信,,,
00:11:33.960,00:11:35.550,是只求大家安心,00:11:31.940,00:11:37.000,"Exorcism is not about convincing, but reassuring."
00:11:36.280,00:11:39.270,那就宝华殿法师日夜开场,,,
00:11:39.880,00:11:41.590,做场水陆大法事吧,00:11:37.300,00:11:43.140,"In that case, we will have the exorcists performing
day and night at the Baohua Hall."
00:11:43.320,00:11:46.790,其他的也罢了 只是冷宫阴气重,,,
00:11:47.600,00:11:49.070,要好好地让法师,00:11:44.080,00:11:53.280,"Especially for the dead in the Cold Palace.
Their souls must be brought to salvation."
00:11:49.280,00:11:51.470,超度一下冷宫里的亡魂哪,,,
00:12:00.920,00:12:02.830,臣妾前几日心神恍惚,,,
00:12:03.320,00:12:04.590,多谢娘娘垂怜,,,
00:12:04.800,00:12:06.270,免了几日向您请安,00:12:02.320,00:12:07.740,"I thank Your Majesty for waiving my attendance
during the past days of my unwellness."
00:12:06.560,00:12:08.510,今儿看着气色是好多了,,,
00:12:08.920,00:12:10.990,前一阵子看着你的小脸,00:12:07.740,00:12:10.160,You look much better today.
00:12:11.280,00:12:12.190,还是苍白的,00:12:10.160,00:12:13.780,I remember seeing your face bloodless a few days back.
00:12:12.760,00:12:14.310,多谢皇后娘娘关怀,,,
00:12:14.680,00:12:16.630,本该日日来向皇后娘娘请安的,00:12:13.900,00:12:15.780,I thank Your Majesty for remembering.
00:12:17.040,00:12:19.470,疏忽了这些日子 还望娘娘恕罪,00:12:15.780,00:12:18.320,It is my duty to pay respect to Your Majesty daily.
00:12:19.920,00:12:20.900,快坐下来吧,00:12:18.320,00:12:20.900,I hope Your Majesty will pardon my negligence.
00:12:21.280,00:12:22.070,谢娘娘,00:12:20.900,00:12:23.840,"- Have a seat.
- I thank Your Majesty."
00:12:23.480,00:12:24.950,你一直都不太好,,,
00:12:25.880,00:12:27.100,本宫也不忍心,,,
00:12:27.520,00:12:29.750,要你每天都跑来跑去的,00:12:25.000,00:12:31.460,"You haven't been too well since you moved in.
I don't have the heart to make you come every day."
00:12:30.520,00:12:33.910,也是 这白天请安也就罢了,00:12:31.600,00:12:35.460,"Of course, it would be easier to come out during the day."
00:12:34.240,00:12:35.550,若是晚上出来,,,
00:12:35.840,00:12:37.710,撞见什么不干净的东西,,,
00:12:38.160,00:12:39.190,那可怎么好,00:12:35.460,00:12:41.200,It would be too bad if you see things walking at night.
00:12:42.720,00:12:45.280,皇后娘娘 打这么大的雷,00:12:43.260,00:12:46.640,"Your Majesty, it's thundering outside."
00:12:45.880,00:12:48.070,恐怕一会儿会有大雷雨呢,00:12:46.640,00:12:49.680,I'm afraid there will be a thunderstorm soon.
00:12:49.000,00:12:51.670,这两天一下雨确实没法出门了,,,
00:12:52.120,00:12:54.350,时候都不早了 你们都散了吧,00:12:50.200,00:12:55.900,"That will make it inconvenient to go out.
We shall dismiss."
00:12:56.040,00:12:57.670,臣妾告退,00:12:57.340,00:13:00.000,I bid Your Majesty a good night.
00:13:05.600,00:13:07.310,今天曹贵人怎么没来呀,,,
00:13:07.920,00:13:10.350,温宜公主染了风寒 她得陪着,00:13:06.780,00:13:09.100,Why didn't Lady Cao come today?
00:13:10.600,00:13:11.350,没法出来,00:13:09.100,00:13:12.800,"Princess Wenyi caught a cold.
She needs to stay with her."
00:13:15.560,00:13:16.830,恭送华妃娘娘,,,
00:13:17.840,00:13:19.060,恭送丽嫔娘娘,00:13:16.500,00:13:18.260,I bid Your Highness Consort Fleur goodbye.
00:13:19.280,00:13:20.910,虽说莞贵人好些了,00:13:18.920,00:13:20.660,I bid Your Highness Concubine Beauté goodbye.
00:13:21.160,00:13:23.620,可本宫瞧你这脸色憔悴许多,00:13:20.660,00:13:25.020,"Lady Sourire has been feeling better,
but you still look very pale."
00:13:24.160,00:13:27.230,想来这噩梦缠身的滋味不好受吧,00:13:25.020,00:13:28.440,I hope you're not suffering too much from your nightmares.
00:13:27.480,00:13:28.230,娘娘别说,,,
00:13:28.680,00:13:30.950,那东西有灵性 会缠人的,00:13:28.500,00:13:32.240,"Your Highness must not speak of it.
It haunts when you do."
00:13:31.200,00:13:33.230,你真是被吓得神志不清了,,,
00:13:33.880,00:13:36.230,竟敢在本宫面前胡言乱语,00:13:32.240,00:13:37.660,"How absurd!
You are out of your mind uttering nonsense to me!"
00:13:36.760,00:13:37.790,华妃娘娘恕罪,,,
00:13:38.520,00:13:41.190,姐姐此番的确是受惊不小,00:13:38.000,00:13:42.720,"Your Highness, please forgive her.
Sourire has been terribly scared."
00:13:42.040,00:13:42.910,实在是,,,
00:13:45.200,00:13:47.270,实在是很多人都亲眼见过,00:13:42.900,00:13:45.760,In fact ...
00:13:47.560,00:13:49.550,所以不得不小心些,00:13:46.400,00:13:51.000,"In fact, many people saw it as well.
We have to be careful therefore."
00:13:49.920,00:13:52.380,是是是 嫔妾就亲眼看到过,00:13:51.000,00:13:53.900,"Yes, exactly! I saw it too!"
00:13:52.960,00:13:54.390,若不是真的有冤魂,,,
00:13:54.680,00:13:56.750,为何连皇后都要举行法事超度,00:13:53.900,00:13:58.340,"Why would Her Majesty have exorcism performed
if the ghost was just our imagination?"
00:13:57.520,00:13:59.350,只是那冤魂怨气冲天的,,,
00:13:59.720,00:14:02.430,也不知法师能不能压得住,00:13:58.500,00:14:03.860,"The ghost seemed extremely vindictive.
I wonder if the exorcists can control her."
00:14:03.040,00:14:04.310,法师也压不住吗,00:14:03.900,00:14:05.960,"The exorcists can repulse ghosts, can't they?"
00:14:04.800,00:14:07.790,她死得那样惨 一定怨气很深的,00:14:06.000,00:14:09.380,She must be bitterly resentful over her death.
00:14:08.400,00:14:12.470,不是说道高一尺 魔高一丈吗,00:14:09.500,00:14:13.840,"""While the Buddha rises to one yard,
the Devil rises to ten."""
00:14:12.840,00:14:14.470,听说当日皇上赐她自尽,,,
00:14:14.800,00:14:16.590,平日里与她交好的妃嫔,,,
00:14:16.880,00:14:18.390,竟无一人替她求情,00:14:13.900,00:14:19.680,"I heard that when His Majesty gave her options for suicide,
not a concubine close to her pleaded her case."
00:14:18.880,00:14:22.110,才使她惨死冷宫 心生怨念,00:14:19.680,00:14:23.600,"That is why she had to
die grudgingly in the Cold Palace."
00:14:22.480,00:14:23.350,这些话从奴才嘴里,,,
00:14:23.640,00:14:25.150,说出来也就罢了,00:14:23.740,00:14:26.520,I would expect to hear those words from the servants.
00:14:25.800,00:14:28.100,从你们这些嫔妃口中说出,,,
00:14:28.800,00:14:30.190,没的失了身份,00:14:26.600,00:14:31.660,"What degradation it is
for you concubines to say that!"
00:14:30.480,00:14:32.390,这些话的确是咱们不该说的,,,
00:14:32.640,00:14:35.390,只是如今闹得人心惶惶的,00:14:31.660,00:14:37.140,"I apologize to have said that.
It's just that everyone has been in a panic lately."
00:14:36.120,00:14:37.710,听闻曹贵人素来胆大,,,
00:14:38.040,00:14:39.870,要是有她陪伴也放心些,00:14:37.140,00:14:41.100,"Lady Cao is a very courageous person.
It would be nice if she was here tonight."
00:14:40.280,00:14:42.580,只是今日怎么不见曹贵人,00:14:41.100,00:14:43.820,I wonder why she's absent.
00:14:43.240,00:14:44.950,温宜公主感染了风寒,,,
00:14:45.240,00:14:46.380,曹贵人得照顾她,00:14:44.500,00:14:48.180,"Princess Wenyi caught a cold.
Lady Cao needs to look after her."
00:14:46.840,00:14:48.670,所以今天没向皇后请安,,,
00:14:49.240,00:14:51.590,莞贵人向来是心思细密,00:14:48.180,00:14:50.600,That is why she didn't come.
00:14:51.920,00:14:53.430,想必是多虑了吧,00:14:50.740,00:14:54.920,"Lady Sourire has a sensitive nature.
I'm afraid you are overthinking."
00:14:54.800,00:14:55.430,咱们走,00:14:55.100,00:14:56.500,Let's get going.
00:14:55.640,00:14:57.590,也是 只要不做亏心事,00:14:56.500,00:14:57.500,Certainly.
00:14:58.160,00:14:59.220,就不怕鬼敲门,00:14:57.500,00:15:00.840,"""A clear conscience
does not fear over a knock on the door."""
00:15:18.120,00:15:19.070,快走 快走吧,,,
00:15:19.520,00:15:20.470,天都这么黑了,00:15:19.060,00:15:20.460,Let's go quickly.
00:15:20.720,00:15:22.350,再晚了脏东西出来怎么办,00:15:20.460,00:15:23.740,"It's very dark now.
What if the unclean spirits come out?"
00:15:22.600,00:15:23.870,是啊 快变天了,,,
00:15:24.200,00:15:25.110,咱们还是快些走吧,00:15:23.740,00:15:26.500,"It's about to rain.
We should go quickly."
00:15:41.680,00:15:42.550,什么东西,,,
00:15:43.480,00:15:44.350,什么事啊,00:15:42.500,00:15:44.000,What was that?
00:15:44.600,00:15:45.870,什么东西 怎么了,00:15:44.740,00:15:45.800,What was what?
,,,00:15:45.800,00:15:47.500,"- What was it?
- What's wrong?"
00:15:57.440,00:15:59.670,鬼 鬼 鬼,00:15:59.000,00:16:01.700,(crowd shouting) A ghost!
00:16:02.520,00:16:04.630,她来了 鬼来找我了,00:16:03.540,00:16:06.200,"She's here!
She's coming for me!"
00:16:06.040,00:16:06.750,是丽嫔的声音,,,
00:16:06.920,00:16:07.630,是,,,
00:16:07.920,00:16:09.270,槿汐 快去禀告皇后,00:16:07.060,00:16:08.900,"- Is it Concubine Beauté?
- It is."
00:16:09.560,00:16:10.190,是,00:16:08.900,00:16:11.020,"Jinxi, report to Her Majesty."
00:16:11.000,00:16:11.830,我们快去看看,00:16:12.440,00:16:14.400,Let's go check out.
00:16:22.920,00:16:24.060,有鬼 有鬼 夜深人静的,00:16:22.780,00:16:24.640,A ghost ... A ghost ...
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.270,你瞎叫唤什么,,,
00:16:25.960,00:16:26.750,还不快闭上嘴,00:16:24.640,00:16:26.660,"It's late at night!
What are you babbling?"
00:16:27.240,00:16:29.510,有鬼 有鬼 有鬼,00:16:26.660,00:16:28.440,Keep your mouth shut!
00:16:29.840,00:16:31.310,她来了 她要来了是不是,00:16:28.500,00:16:31.300,A ghost ... A ghost ... A ghost!
00:16:31.720,00:16:32.630,她来了是不是,00:16:31.400,00:16:34.280,"She's here!
She's here, isn't she?"
00:16:35.160,00:16:37.460,谁再胡说 立刻发落她去冷宫,00:16:36.560,00:16:39.420,Shut your mouth or I'll send you to the Cold Palace!
00:16:42.640,00:16:44.990,愣着干什么 把她扶起来,00:16:43.860,00:16:46.600,"What are you waiting for?
Help her up!"
00:16:49.240,00:16:51.030,不是我 不是我,,,
00:16:51.320,00:16:53.070,药是我 药是我弄的,00:16:50.360,00:16:52.660,Not me! It wasn't me!
00:16:53.360,00:16:56.150,我没让她害死莞贵人 不是我,00:16:52.800,00:16:54.800,The medicine ... I got her the medicine ...
00:16:56.760,00:16:57.790,丽嫔失心疯了,00:16:54.800,00:16:57.740,"I didn't ask her to poison Lady Sourire!
Not me!"
00:16:58.160,00:16:59.110,还不快堵上她的嘴,00:16:57.740,00:16:59.180,She's gone insane.
00:16:59.320,00:17:00.190,带回翊坤宫去,00:16:59.180,00:17:01.600,"Cover her mouth
and take her with me!"
00:17:00.480,00:17:01.230,等一下,00:17:01.780,00:17:03.020,Hold on!
00:17:05.320,00:17:06.590,华妃娘娘三思,,,
00:17:07.320,00:17:09.830,此刻发生了什么事 尚且不清楚,00:17:06.480,00:17:08.580,I hope Your Highness will reconsider.
00:17:10.240,00:17:10.990,嫔妾以为,00:17:08.580,00:17:11.620,It is not clear yet what has just happened.
00:17:11.200,00:17:12.710,应先把丽嫔送回她宫中,,,
00:17:13.040,00:17:14.310,再急召太医才是,00:17:11.620,00:17:15.740,"I tend to think that we should send Concubine Beauté
back to her palace and summon the imperial doctors."
00:17:14.760,00:17:16.790,怎的要先去翊坤宫,00:17:15.740,00:17:18.460,Why should she go with Your Highness?
00:17:17.400,00:17:19.470,丽嫔大失常态 不宜见人,00:17:18.460,00:17:21.220,"Concubine Beauté lost her mind
and should not be seen in public."
00:17:20.000,00:17:21.750,还是带回翊坤宫方便些,00:17:21.220,00:17:23.260,It'll save her the trouble if she stays with me.
00:17:23.080,00:17:24.390,娘娘说得极是,,,
00:17:24.880,00:17:25.990,只是事发突然,00:17:23.940,00:17:26.120,I would agree with Your Highness.
00:17:26.320,00:17:29.310,嫔妾以为应先派人回禀皇后才是,00:17:26.120,00:17:31.060,"But I believe such an emergency must
first be reported to Her Majesty."
00:17:30.160,00:17:31.190,事从权宜,,,
00:17:31.960,00:17:33.350,丽嫔如此状况,00:17:31.100,00:17:33.100,We have to act in an expedient manner.
00:17:33.560,00:17:35.030,恐污了皇后的耳朵,00:17:33.100,00:17:36.520,"I'm afraid her mad utterances
would terribly disturb Her Majesty."
00:17:35.240,00:17:37.270,晚一会儿再回禀皇后也不迟,,,
00:17:38.240,00:17:40.470,本宫一向助皇后协理六宫,00:17:36.520,00:17:39.060,We can report to her later.
00:17:41.160,00:17:43.460,难道这点事还做不了主吗,00:17:39.100,00:17:44.960,"I assist the Empress in managing the palace.
I believe I'm able to make decisions on her behalf."
00:17:43.680,00:17:45.630,丽嫔乃一宫主位 事关重大,,,
00:17:46.000,00:17:47.790,娘娘实在应告知皇后娘娘,00:17:45.000,00:17:47.080,"This is a matter of consequence concerning
the head concubine of a palace."
00:17:48.120,00:17:49.260,以免日后皇上怪罪,00:17:47.080,00:17:50.660,"I'm afraid His Majesty would be dissatisfied
that the Empress was not informed."
00:17:50.080,00:17:52.150,就算莞贵人圣眷优容,,,
00:17:52.600,00:17:54.510,也不必拿皇上来压本宫吧,00:17:51.260,00:17:56.380,"Don't you use His Majesty against me
even though he is very fond of you."
00:17:55.080,00:17:56.590,你们如此阻拦本宫,,,
00:17:57.080,00:17:59.070,是存心要与本宫过不去吗,00:17:56.380,00:18:00.800,Are the two of you trying to find quarrel in a straw?
00:18:00.280,00:18:02.430,嫔妾并非要与娘娘过意不去,,,
00:18:02.760,00:18:04.110,只是方才丽嫔言语中,00:18:01.600,00:18:04.120,I have no intention of that.
00:18:04.320,00:18:06.150,涉及了嫔妾前时中毒之事,00:18:04.120,00:18:07.620,"Concubine Beauté claimed to be
implicated in Yu's scheme to poison me."
00:18:06.600,00:18:08.980,嫔妾身在其中 不得不多此一举,00:18:07.620,00:18:10.900,"As a victim of the incident,
I have to do more than necessary."
00:18:13.880,00:18:16.310,还愣着干什么 把她带回去,00:18:15.260,00:18:18.320,"Did you not hear me?
Take her back!"
00:18:18.200,00:18:20.660,皇后娘娘驾到,00:18:19.480,00:18:22.280,Her Majesty the Empress.
00:18:21.960,00:18:24.030,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:18:23.400,00:18:25.980,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:18:35.640,00:18:36.750,皇后娘娘吉祥,00:18:37.000,00:18:38.720,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:18:44.480,00:18:45.310,都起来吧,,,
00:18:46.200,00:18:47.750,谢皇后娘娘,00:18:45.580,00:18:47.340,All rise.
00:18:54.760,00:18:56.870,在后宫里边大吵大闹的,00:18:47.500,00:18:49.680,I thank Your Majesty.
00:18:57.280,00:18:58.830,本宫想安心都不行,00:18:56.000,00:19:00.600,"What peace would I have when you all
cause so much commotion in the harem?"
00:19:00.840,00:19:02.150,丽嫔是怎么回事啊,00:19:01.900,00:19:04.740,What happened to Concubine Beauté?
00:19:05.520,00:19:06.990,周甯海 你一个奴才,,,
00:19:07.360,00:19:08.580,怎么敢捂了丽嫔的嘴呀,00:19:06.800,00:19:10.080,"Zhou Ninghai, you are a servant!
How dare you put your hand on her mouth?"
00:19:09.560,00:19:10.670,真是以下犯上,,,
00:19:11.320,00:19:12.380,皇后有所不知,00:19:10.940,00:19:12.740,What an offence!
00:19:12.720,00:19:13.990,丽嫔暴病胡言乱语,00:19:12.740,00:19:15.420,"Your Majesty, Concubine Beauté
lost her mind and started to talk nonsense."
00:19:14.640,00:19:16.190,臣妾才让人捂了她的嘴,,,
00:19:16.600,00:19:18.270,以免秽语扰乱人心,00:19:15.420,00:19:19.900,"I asked him to quiet her down
lest she disturbs the other concubines."
00:19:18.600,00:19:19.950,那也得先放开她呀,,,
00:19:20.240,00:19:22.150,难不成要这样捂着丽嫔的嘴,00:19:20.040,00:19:21.460,But you must let go of her!
00:19:22.600,00:19:23.740,送回启祥宫去吗,00:19:21.460,00:19:25.380,Are you going to walk her back with her mouth covered?
00:19:30.200,00:19:31.550,娘娘救我 你干什么,,,
00:19:31.880,00:19:32.710,娘娘 余氏来了,00:19:31.200,00:19:32.500,"- Help me! Your Highness!
- What are you doing?"
00:19:33.000,00:19:35.030,那事不是我让她做的 不是,00:19:32.500,00:19:34.080,Yu came after me! Your Highness!
00:19:35.880,00:19:36.670,放开娘娘,00:19:34.080,00:19:36.600,I didn't make her do it! I didn't!
00:19:37.040,00:19:38.910,是 和谁都不相干,00:19:36.600,00:19:38.000,Let go of Her Highness!
00:19:39.160,00:19:40.110,是她自作孽,00:19:38.000,00:19:41.300,"No, it has nothing to do with anyone else.
It was her own fault."
00:19:40.360,00:19:41.580,别怕 余氏没来,,,
00:19:41.920,00:19:43.030,快跟本宫回宫去吧,00:19:41.300,00:19:43.220,Don't be scared. It wasn't Yu.
00:19:46.040,00:19:46.670,娘娘,00:19:43.220,00:19:44.600,Go with me quickly.
00:19:46.960,00:19:48.590,余氏她来了 她来了,00:19:47.420,00:19:50.080,Yu is here! She's here!
00:19:49.560,00:19:50.830,她来找咱们寻仇了,,,
00:19:51.000,00:19:51.790,胡说些什么,00:19:50.500,00:19:52.200,She's coming after us!
,,,00:19:52.200,00:19:53.200,Nonsense!
00:19:52.280,00:19:56.230,皇后娘娘救我 有鬼 有鬼,00:19:53.360,00:19:55.240,Help me! Your Majesty!
00:19:56.520,00:19:57.630,疯言疯语成何体统,00:19:55.240,00:19:57.500,A ghost! A ghost!
00:19:58.200,00:19:59.750,你这样子本宫也不放心哪,00:19:57.500,00:19:59.000,You must stop talking nonsense!
00:20:00.280,00:20:00.790,江福海,00:19:59.000,00:20:01.300,It would worry me if you are to be alone tonight.
00:20:00.960,00:20:01.350,在,,,
00:20:01.680,00:20:02.430,带丽嫔回景仁宫,00:20:01.300,00:20:02.540,"- Jiang Fuhai.
- Yes."
00:20:02.720,00:20:03.390,皇后娘娘,00:20:02.540,00:20:04.000,She'll stay at the Palace of Great Benevolence tonight.
00:20:07.040,00:20:09.190,丽嫔的病症像是失心疯,00:20:04.000,00:20:05.300,Your Majesty.
00:20:09.800,00:20:11.670,怎能带去景仁宫扰您休息,00:20:07.900,00:20:11.080,It seems that Concubine Beauté is mentally ill.
00:20:12.760,00:20:14.430,还是由臣妾带回去,00:20:11.080,00:20:13.440,I'm afraid she will disturb Your Majesty all night.
00:20:14.920,00:20:16.030,让臣妾照顾吧,00:20:14.220,00:20:17.700,It would be better if I take care of her tonight.
00:20:16.400,00:20:19.190,景仁宫那么大 总会有地方安置,00:20:17.700,00:20:21.080,"Of so many chambers in my palace,
there is certainly a place for Concubine Beauté."
00:20:20.000,00:20:22.460,更何况丽嫔她虽说神志不清,,,
00:20:23.120,00:20:23.950,可言语之间,,,
00:20:24.240,00:20:26.620,口口声声涉及余氏投毒之事,00:20:21.080,00:20:28.260,"More importantly, she revealed involvement in Yu's crime."
00:20:27.200,00:20:29.910,事关重大 本宫不得不追查,00:20:28.260,00:20:31.580,"This is a matter of great consequence
that I must investigate."
00:20:30.720,00:20:33.230,难道华妃觉得丽嫔在本宫那里,,,
00:20:33.680,00:20:34.870,有什么不妥吗,00:20:31.600,00:20:36.460,Do you not agree that I should stay with her tonight?
00:20:38.320,00:20:39.430,臣妾自然不担心,,,
00:20:39.720,00:20:41.110,皇后照顾有何不妥,00:20:39.500,00:20:42.540,"Of course it is appropriate
for Your Majesty to take care of her."
00:20:42.200,00:20:44.660,只是皇上亲命臣妾协理六宫,,,
00:20:44.960,00:20:46.950,当然是觉得臣妾,00:20:42.540,00:20:50.320,"I simply wished to spare Your Majesty the trouble
as His Majesty entrusted me to assist you."
00:20:47.200,00:20:48.670,可以为皇后分忧了,,,
00:20:49.800,00:20:51.910,臣妾怕皇上怪罪臣妾,,,
00:20:53.240,00:20:54.710,不体恤皇后,00:20:50.800,00:20:56.900,"Otherwise, His Majesty would blame me
for being inconsiderate."
00:21:02.560,00:21:04.940,皇后乃六宫之主 由您亲自费神,,,
00:21:05.280,00:21:06.470,皇上必定更加放心,00:21:03.480,00:21:08.180,"Your Majesty is the head of the harem.
His Majesty will be more assured if you investigate into it."
00:21:09.000,00:21:10.140,恭送皇后娘娘,00:21:10.040,00:21:11.760,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:21:11.720,00:21:13.750,恭送皇后娘娘,,,
00:21:14.040,00:21:15.670,江福海 带上丽嫔,00:21:13.000,00:21:15.300,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:21:16.080,00:21:16.750,嗻,00:21:15.300,00:21:17.520,"Jiang Fuhai, bring along Concubine Beauté."

00:21:32.760,00:21:34.670,小主 两位小主可回来了,,,
00:21:35.080,00:21:36.110,这么长时间才回来,00:21:34.140,00:21:36.060,"My Lady ... You're back, My Ladies."
00:21:36.480,00:21:37.540,让我们担心坏了呢,00:21:36.060,00:21:39.140,"Why did it take so long?
It worried us so much."
00:21:38.080,00:21:38.830,小允子,00:21:39.140,00:21:40.320,Xiao-Yunzi.
00:21:39.440,00:21:41.190,让你装神弄鬼 可委屈你了,00:21:40.320,00:21:42.300,Sorry that you had to play the ghost.
00:21:41.680,00:21:43.350,小主说这话可折煞奴才了,00:21:42.600,00:21:44.180,"I'm deeply flattered, My Lady."
00:21:44.040,00:21:45.870,不过奴才刚刚偷偷照了镜子,00:21:44.940,00:21:46.540,But I did take a look at myself in the mirror.
00:21:46.120,00:21:48.270,那个样子的确把自己都吓了一跳,00:21:46.900,00:21:49.280,That even startled myself.
00:21:49.600,00:21:50.310,可不是吗,00:21:49.500,00:21:51.580,You look much more than startling.
00:21:50.640,00:21:53.270,你把丽嫔吓得不轻 颠三倒四的,,,
00:21:53.560,00:21:54.590,倒说漏嘴了不少,00:21:51.940,00:21:55.500,"Concubine Beauté was so frightened
that she burst out everything!"
00:21:55.280,00:21:56.670,没想到奴才这点小本事,,,
00:21:56.960,00:21:57.830,还派上这用场,00:21:56.320,00:21:58.700,I'm glad my little tricks could be useful.
00:21:58.200,00:21:59.550,还真得谢谢浣碧姐姐,,,
00:21:59.800,00:22:01.270,给奴才准备这身白纱衣,00:21:59.300,00:22:01.900,I must thank Jade for making the costume
00:22:01.520,00:22:02.190,还有安答应,,,
00:22:02.400,00:22:04.190,给奴才画的这张大白脸,00:22:02.320,00:22:05.500,and Companion An for painting my big white face!
00:22:05.800,00:22:06.940,我那些算什么,,,
00:22:07.240,00:22:08.550,还是两位姐姐的主意好,00:22:06.780,00:22:09.280,"It was nothing compared to the idea
that you two came up with."
00:22:09.040,00:22:10.510,是你先想的法子好,,,
00:22:10.840,00:22:11.470,我和嬛儿,,,
00:22:11.720,00:22:13.910,不过是把法子想全了去做罢了,00:22:09.620,00:22:14.480,"No, you came up with the brilliant idea.
We simply added a few more details."
00:22:14.120,00:22:15.550,姐姐不会怪我狠毒吧,00:22:14.720,00:22:16.100,Will you think that I was ruthless?
00:22:16.320,00:22:17.350,我做的这一切,,,
00:22:17.840,00:22:19.790,都是为了咱们在宫中能够平安,00:22:16.980,00:22:20.740,I did all this just to make us safe in the palace.
00:22:20.440,00:22:21.310,怎么会,00:22:21.000,00:22:22.300,Why would we think that way?
00:22:21.640,00:22:23.670,咱们都是姐妹 谁会说这个,00:22:22.380,00:22:24.180,We are sisters.
00:22:25.200,00:22:26.670,眉姐姐也不会怪我吗,00:22:25.500,00:22:27.140,"Will you, Meizhuang?"
00:22:26.960,00:22:27.630,你最细密,00:22:27.140,00:22:28.820,You have the most attentive eye
00:22:27.880,00:22:30.310,发现丽嫔最怕鬼神 也亏了你了,00:22:28.820,00:22:31.140,"to have noticed that Concubine Beauté
was very afraid of ghosts."
00:22:30.680,00:22:32.190,好了好了 先不说这个了,00:22:31.560,00:22:33.200,"All right, so much for the ghost."
00:22:32.560,00:22:34.550,小允子 先把这行头给烧了,00:22:33.700,00:22:35.400,"Xiao-Yunzi, burn the costume."
00:22:35.040,00:22:36.710,万一露了痕迹反而要坏事,00:22:35.860,00:22:37.640,We shall leave no trace behind.
00:22:36.960,00:22:37.940,嗻 奴才知道,00:22:37.900,00:22:38.540,"Yes, I understand."
00:22:47.040,00:22:48.150,娘娘坐会儿吧,,,
00:22:48.520,00:22:49.630,来回走得也累了,00:22:48.060,00:22:49.300,"Your Highness, please have a seat."
,,,00:22:49.360,00:22:50.640,You've been pacing the room all night.
00:22:50.680,00:22:52.950,叫你来了半日 一句话都没有,00:22:51.300,00:22:53.760,"Yes, that is all you've uttered all this time!"
00:22:55.440,00:22:56.660,哭哭哭 就知道哭,,,
00:22:57.040,00:22:58.020,你带她来做什么,00:22:56.240,00:22:57.820,"Cry, cry, cry!
What else can you do?"
00:22:58.400,00:22:59.270,娘娘您息怒,00:22:57.820,00:22:58.940,Why is she even here?
00:22:59.520,00:23:01.390,公主她是病了 离不开臣妾,00:22:59.000,00:23:00.220,"Your Highness, please pardon her."
00:23:02.440,00:23:03.630,出了这么大的事,00:23:00.620,00:23:02.600,She is sick and needs me to be around.
00:23:04.160,00:23:05.270,你倒没了主意了,00:23:03.240,00:23:07.200,"What use are you in such a crisis?
You can't even come up with an idea!"
00:23:06.760,00:23:09.430,娘娘 您相信鬼神之说吗,00:23:07.700,00:23:11.200,"Your Highness, do you believe in ghosts?"
00:23:11.080,00:23:12.510,正是因为娘娘不信,,,
00:23:12.920,00:23:15.030,所以鬼神并不敢侵邪,00:23:11.700,00:23:15.880,"It is because you don't
that they dared not approach you."
00:23:15.480,00:23:17.190,而丽嫔色厉内荏,00:23:16.000,00:23:18.500,"Concubine Beauté, however,
is not as strong as she appears."
00:23:17.520,00:23:19.870,装神弄鬼的也就唬住她了,00:23:18.580,00:23:21.480,That's why a mere ghost prank could break her down.
00:23:20.680,00:23:21.870,装神弄鬼,00:23:21.820,00:23:23.920,A ghost prank?
00:23:24.880,00:23:26.790,你是说有人装神弄鬼,00:23:26.000,00:23:28.000,You think that was a prank?
00:23:27.880,00:23:29.510,否则何以解释那鬼魂,,,
00:23:29.880,00:23:30.710,只敢吓唬丽嫔,,,
00:23:31.080,00:23:32.300,却不敢接近娘娘呢,00:23:28.720,00:23:33.280,"Otherwise, why would the ghost approach
Concubine Beauté but not Your Highness?"
00:23:33.480,00:23:36.990,是甄嬛 一定是她,00:23:34.000,00:23:37.560,It was Zhen Huan. It must be her.
00:23:37.640,00:23:39.430,沈眉庄没那么多鬼主意,00:23:38.480,00:23:41.560,"Shen Meizhuang wouldn't
come up with such a nasty plot."
00:23:40.920,00:23:43.870,好 她敢装神弄鬼,00:23:41.820,00:23:44.940,"Very well, she dared to play a ghost prank."
00:23:44.560,00:23:46.270,我就把她的碎玉轩翻过来,,,
00:23:46.880,00:23:48.990,翻出来那些装神弄鬼的东西,00:23:45.340,00:23:49.820,"I will turn her palace upside down
to find her prank props."
00:23:49.160,00:23:49.870,不可,00:23:49.940,00:23:50.940,"No, Your Highness."
00:23:50.800,00:23:52.230,娘娘 万万不可,00:23:51.220,00:23:53.060,Your Highness must not do that.
00:23:52.520,00:23:54.070,此事您已脱不了干系,00:23:53.360,00:23:54.960,Your Highness is already under suspicion.
00:23:54.520,00:23:56.950,若再大肆搜宫 反而不妙了,00:23:55.500,00:23:57.940,To raid her palace will bring nothing but trouble to yourself.
00:23:57.360,00:23:59.510,况且甄嬛必定早毁去那些物件,,,
00:23:59.880,00:24:00.710,您搜也无用啊,00:23:58.360,00:24:01.800,"And Zhen Huan must have eliminated all evidence.
Your search would be of no avail."
00:24:01.080,00:24:02.190,难道坐以待毙不成吗,00:24:01.860,00:24:03.200,So am I supposed sit there and do nothing?
00:24:02.600,00:24:05.270,所幸 丽嫔不是已经疯了吗,00:24:03.320,00:24:05.940,"Fortunately, Concubine Beauté has gone insane, hasn't she?"
00:24:05.560,00:24:06.910,疯了才会胡言乱语,00:24:06.240,00:24:08.680,That is why she was talking insanely!
00:24:11.840,00:24:12.750,疯了,00:24:12.500,00:24:14.500,Talking insanely ...
00:24:16.840,00:24:18.430,疯子的话信不得,00:24:17.080,00:24:20.500,How could you believe what a madwoman says?
00:24:23.560,00:24:25.860,疯子的话是不能信的,00:24:25.000,00:24:27.420,A madwoman's words are not to be credited.
00:24:34.560,00:24:36.860,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:24:35.160,00:24:38.240,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:24:37.120,00:24:37.910,都起来吧,00:24:38.240,00:24:39.460,All rise.
00:24:39.920,00:24:41.630,谢皇后娘娘,00:24:41.300,00:24:43.300,I thank Your Majesty.
00:24:45.520,00:24:46.990,本宫这么早叫你们来,,,
00:24:47.280,00:24:48.630,是为了昨天晚上的事,,,
00:24:49.160,00:24:50.220,想问个仔细,00:24:46.760,00:24:51.800,"I summoned you all so early in the morning because
I wish to know the details of what happened last night."
00:24:52.200,00:24:54.150,太后驾到,00:24:53.360,00:24:55.560,Her Majesty the Empress Dowager.
00:24:59.400,00:25:02.150,给太后请安 太后金安,00:25:00.560,00:25:03.480,"I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
Peace to Your Majesty."
00:25:03.040,00:25:03.910,都起来吧,,,
00:25:04.320,00:25:05.790,谢太后,00:25:04.000,00:25:05.360,All rise.
,,,00:25:05.360,00:25:07.000,I thank Your Majesty.
00:25:06.720,00:25:09.750,华妃一早来请安 说丽嫔不大好,00:25:07.900,00:25:10.960,"Consort Fleur informed me
that Concubine Beauté is unwell."
00:25:10.160,00:25:11.470,哀家过来看看,00:25:10.960,00:25:12.960,I'm worried about her.
00:25:16.400,00:25:18.470,今日的事怎么惊动太后了,,,
00:25:19.880,00:25:21.710,我想大约是华妃怕被疑心,00:25:18.000,00:25:20.500,Why was the Empress Dowager brought into this?
00:25:22.040,00:25:23.750,就先告诉太后撇清自己,00:25:20.620,00:25:25.060,"It must be Consort Fleur's effort
to disentangle herself from this."
00:25:24.920,00:25:26.110,她胆子倒大,,,
00:25:26.400,00:25:28.470,太后是皇后娘娘的自家人,00:25:25.980,00:25:27.560,That was very bold of her.
00:25:28.840,00:25:30.230,自然是护着皇后的,00:25:27.560,00:25:31.640,"The Empress Dowager is related to the Empress.
She will lean towards the Empress."
00:25:30.760,00:25:33.430,她敢这么做 必然是有几分把握,00:25:31.640,00:25:34.860,"But Consort Fleur was the one who invited the Empress Dowager.
She had confidence in what she was doing."
00:25:33.760,00:25:36.320,再有把握也比不上骨肉血缘哪,00:25:34.900,00:25:37.600,But nothing she has can compare to a blood relation.
00:25:36.560,00:25:38.190,皇后一直被华妃压着,,,
00:25:38.480,00:25:40.390,太后心里肯定不高兴,00:25:37.600,00:25:41.580,"The Empress Dowager must not be pleased that
Consort Fleur has always kept the Empress suppressed."
00:25:41.040,00:25:42.590,昨夜的事闹得那么大,,,
00:25:43.240,00:25:46.150,如今人人的眼睛都在盯着景仁宫,00:25:42.100,00:25:47.600,"In the wake of the commotion last night,
all eyes are watching the Palace of Great Benevolence."
00:25:46.800,00:25:48.270,现在却没什么动静,00:25:47.600,00:25:50.000,But nothing really happened.
00:25:49.480,00:25:51.030,小时候听人说,,,
00:25:51.440,00:25:53.900,但凡海上有风暴来临前,00:25:50.620,00:25:52.780,I heard this when I was a child
00:25:54.320,00:25:56.750,海面总是格外平静,00:25:52.780,00:25:58.580,that there is always a calm before the storm on the sea.
00:26:09.120,00:26:11.190,太后听了大半晌的胡话,,,
00:26:11.560,00:26:12.750,怕是也听烦了,00:26:10.300,00:26:14.200,Your Majesty must have grown tired of all these mad talks.
00:26:13.240,00:26:14.750,先喝口水歇歇吧,00:26:14.200,00:26:16.420,Please take a break and have some tea.
00:26:16.600,00:26:18.110,这样新奇的胡话,,,
00:26:18.760,00:26:20.550,哀家也是难得听到,00:26:17.560,00:26:22.100,It is rare that I get to hear these mad talks.
00:26:21.520,00:26:22.870,太后听过就算了,,,
00:26:23.120,00:26:25.630,臣妾会请太医好好医治丽嫔的,00:26:22.680,00:26:27.000,"You Majesty must not bear the mad words in mind.
I will have the doctors attend to Concubine Beauté."
00:26:25.840,00:26:26.630,不必了,,,
00:26:27.160,00:26:29.310,疯疯颠颠的话就这么难听了,00:26:27.000,00:26:28.180,There's no need.
00:26:29.640,00:26:31.310,更别说她醒了的话了,00:26:28.180,00:26:32.700,Her sober words won't be any more pleasant to hear.
00:26:32.000,00:26:34.110,让她离开景仁宫 去冷宫,00:26:32.700,00:26:35.720,She will be sent to the Cold Palace
00:26:34.720,00:26:36.270,省得脏了你这块地方,00:26:35.720,00:26:38.100,to keep your palace clean.
00:26:37.120,00:26:40.870,是 臣妾明日就交代挪宫的事,00:26:38.100,00:26:42.500,"Yes, I will assign that tomorrow."
00:26:43.400,00:26:44.910,丽嫔还真不中用,,,
00:26:45.400,00:26:46.710,经不得这么一吓,00:26:44.000,00:26:48.200,How useless she is to have broken down in fright.
00:26:48.160,00:26:48.990,可见呀,,,
00:26:49.240,00:26:51.390,做贼心虚这句话是不错的,00:26:49.180,00:26:52.840,It is true that a guilty conscience needs no accuser.
00:26:52.640,00:26:55.020,可是丽嫔说是华妃指使的,00:26:53.780,00:26:56.200,"But Concubine Beauté said that
Consort Fleur was behind this."
00:26:55.360,00:26:56.580,华妃指使的又如何,,,
00:26:57.120,00:26:59.230,丽嫔的话只能当是疯话,00:26:56.300,00:27:00.640,"So what?
That is merely her mad talks."
00:27:00.080,00:27:02.070,太后 哀家知道,00:27:01.140,00:27:03.380,"- Your Majesty ...
- I know."
00:27:02.320,00:27:03.950,华妃压了你这些年,00:27:03.380,00:27:05.480,"Consort Fleur has quelled your authority
for all these years."
00:27:06.360,00:27:08.110,她也是太不知收敛,00:27:05.800,00:27:07.040,(sigh)
00:27:08.720,00:27:11.670,自从进了王府就恃宠妄为,00:27:07.040,00:27:09.700,She never learns to know there are limits
00:27:12.000,00:27:13.350,可是皇帝喜欢她,00:27:09.700,00:27:13.000,ever since she was married into the family.
00:27:14.080,00:27:15.910,她的哥哥又是年羹尧,00:27:13.100,00:27:17.580,"But the Emperor is fond of her,
and her brother is Nian Gengyao."
00:27:17.240,00:27:18.830,现在丽嫔疯了,00:27:18.100,00:27:20.260,"Now that Concubine Beauté is insane,"
00:27:19.160,00:27:21.670,谁都知道疯子的话是不能信的,00:27:20.260,00:27:23.720,no one will trust the words of a madwoman.
00:27:23.840,00:27:24.630,是,00:27:24.700,00:27:26.100,Yes.
00:27:26.400,00:27:29.350,所以小惩大戒 点到为止就行了,00:27:27.700,00:27:31.120,We will just send a warning to Consort Fleur.
00:27:30.480,00:27:33.390,对外就说宫中流言四起,,,
00:27:34.240,00:27:35.990,必须你这个皇后来管理,00:27:31.300,00:27:38.300,"You will say that the harem must be managed
by yourself to stop the rumors."
00:27:36.320,00:27:37.110,才能镇得住,,,
00:27:37.400,00:27:38.310,那皇上那边,00:27:38.520,00:27:39.760,What if His Majesty ...
00:27:38.560,00:27:41.550,皇帝回来 哀家会告诉他,00:27:39.760,00:27:43.200,I will tell him when he's back
00:27:42.560,00:27:45.990,是你处置了六宫 平定了谣言,00:27:43.880,00:27:47.620,that you dispelled the rumor and pacified the harem.
00:27:47.080,00:27:50.350,至于莞贵人 她很聪明,00:27:48.280,00:27:52.080,"As for Lady Sourire, she is very smart."
00:27:51.520,00:27:52.950,沈贵人也沉稳,,,
00:27:53.880,00:27:54.710,有些事,00:27:52.740,00:27:54.760,And Lady Shen is reliable.
00:27:55.080,00:27:57.640,你可以让沈贵人试着历练着去办,00:27:54.900,00:27:59.100,You may have Lady Shen groomed for managing the harem.
00:27:58.520,00:28:01.150,是 都是皇上和太后,,,
00:28:01.520,00:28:02.870,亲自选的秀女,00:27:59.700,00:28:04.500,"Yes, they were both selected by you and His Majesty."
00:28:04.760,00:28:06.470,那就传哀家的懿旨,,,
00:28:07.040,00:28:08.550,让华妃好好休息,00:28:05.900,00:28:09.840,"Announce my decree that Consort Fleur
will be suspended from her duty."
00:28:09.080,00:28:12.470,协理六宫的事 用不着她操心了,00:28:09.840,00:28:14.340,"She will take a break from
assisting in the palace affairs."
00:28:14.760,00:28:15.590,是,00:28:15.780,00:28:17.500,Yes.
00:28:23.560,00:28:24.270,浣碧,,,
00:28:26.240,00:28:27.350,你怎么在这里呀,00:28:24.700,00:28:25.940,Jade.
00:28:28.320,00:28:29.070,安小主好,00:28:27.580,00:28:28.980,What brought you here?
00:28:29.480,00:28:31.150,我家小主让我去取些香烛,00:28:29.300,00:28:30.620,"Greetings, My Lady."
00:28:31.440,00:28:33.230,顺便把画好的佛经给烧了,00:28:30.620,00:28:34.560,"Lady Sourire asked me to get some joss sticks
and burn the sutras she copied."
00:28:35.120,00:28:37.070,姐姐怎么突然烧起佛经来了,00:28:35.000,00:28:38.600,"Ah, why did Sourire want to have the sutras burnt?"
00:28:37.480,00:28:40.110,小主说近日宫中出现的事情多,,,
00:28:40.360,00:28:41.670,烧些佛经保平安嘛,00:28:38.600,00:28:42.920,My Lady wishes peace for the palace in this time of chaos.
00:28:42.160,00:28:43.870,再者 余氏已死,,,
00:28:44.120,00:28:45.430,再坏也是生前的事了,00:28:43.300,00:28:46.560,"And salvation for Yu as well,"
00:28:45.680,00:28:47.950,让我也烧些给她 让她早日超脱,00:28:46.560,00:28:49.680,no matter what she did in her past life.
00:28:50.280,00:28:51.150,时辰不早了,,,
00:28:51.440,00:28:52.420,那奴婢就先告辞了,00:28:49.680,00:28:53.880,"I should return quickly.
Please allow me to take my leave."
00:28:53.200,00:28:53.910,好,00:28:54.000,00:28:55.480,Certainly.
00:28:58.560,00:28:59.190,小主,,,
00:28:59.840,00:29:00.820,小主 你怎么了,00:28:59.000,00:29:00.460,My Lady ...
00:29:02.280,00:29:04.270,姐姐让浣碧给余氏烧佛经,00:29:00.460,00:29:02.140,"What's wrong, My Lady?"
00:29:05.280,00:29:06.910,是不是怪我逼死余氏,00:29:03.180,00:29:08.580,"Sourire copied sutras for Yu.
Does she blame me for what I did?"
00:29:07.560,00:29:08.390,怎么会呢,,,
00:29:08.960,00:29:11.110,这事莞贵人也脱不了干系,00:29:08.580,00:29:10.020,Why would she?
00:29:11.520,00:29:13.030,莞贵人怎么会怪小主呢,00:29:10.020,00:29:14.500,Lady Sourire is directly involved to Yu's death.
00:29:13.440,00:29:14.710,小主 你别多想了,00:29:14.660,00:29:16.600,"Don't overthink, My Lady."
00:29:16.360,00:29:17.070,我们走吧,00:29:17.160,00:29:18.760,We should go.
00:29:19.600,00:29:21.270,皇上驾到,00:29:20.500,00:29:22.560,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:29:22.480,00:29:24.710,皇上 皇上万福金安,00:29:23.000,00:29:24.440,His Majesty?
00:29:24.920,00:29:25.710,快起来吧,00:29:24.440,00:29:26.140,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:29:26.360,00:29:27.710,皇上您总算回来了,00:29:26.140,00:29:27.180,Rise immediately.
00:29:27.880,00:29:28.550,坐,00:29:27.180,00:29:29.100,Your Majesty finally came back.
00:29:32.560,00:29:33.350,想朕了,00:29:29.100,00:29:30.500,Have a seat.
00:29:34.600,00:29:35.820,臣妾惦念皇上,00:29:33.300,00:29:34.820,Did you miss me?
00:29:36.080,00:29:38.430,外出巡视这段日子一定很辛苦吧,00:29:35.480,00:29:39.740,"I would always think of Your Majesty,
hoping Your Majesty was well during the trip."
00:29:38.920,00:29:40.790,朕刚刚去见过太后,,,
00:29:41.360,00:29:43.030,下毒的事有了了结,00:29:39.800,00:29:44.300,"I just visited the Empress Dowager.
She told me about the settlement of Concubine Beauté."
00:29:43.760,00:29:46.870,你能安心 朕的心里也松快些,00:29:44.320,00:29:48.240,I feel relieved that you can finally put your mind at ease.
00:29:47.480,00:29:50.110,事情既已过去 皇上就别动气了,00:29:48.300,00:29:51.400,"I hope Your Majesty would not
be incensed by the bygones."
00:29:51.000,00:29:53.070,丽嫔也是在意皇上,,,
00:29:53.560,00:29:54.700,才会忌恨臣妾,00:29:52.100,00:29:56.320,"Concubine Beauté avenged herself on me
because she cared about Your Majesty."
00:29:55.800,00:29:56.630,在意朕,,,
00:29:57.320,00:29:59.700,她在意的是自己的荣华还是朕,00:29:57.000,00:29:58.500,She cared about me?
00:30:00.000,00:30:01.470,只有她自己心里清楚,00:29:58.500,00:30:02.980,"Only she can tell whether it was me or herself
that she really cared about."
00:30:02.240,00:30:03.670,就算是她在意朕,,,
00:30:04.000,00:30:05.790,因为这个做了阴毒之事,,,
00:30:06.120,00:30:07.990,朕也是绝不能轻纵她,00:30:03.000,00:30:09.600,"Even if it was because she cared about me,
I won't tolerate her for her malice."
00:30:08.840,00:30:10.750,丽嫔犯错 已经得到了教训,00:30:09.700,00:30:12.940,I believe she has paid the price for the wrong she did.
00:30:11.800,00:30:12.990,虽然华妃娘娘,,,
00:30:13.400,00:30:15.150,素日与丽嫔多有来往,00:30:12.940,00:30:16.380,"Although Consort Fleur was
on good terms with Concubine Beauté,"
00:30:15.800,00:30:18.630,但想来华妃娘娘也不会糊涂到,,,
00:30:18.880,00:30:20.070,与丽嫔同流合污,00:30:16.380,00:30:21.360,"I believer Her Highness wouldn't
reduce herself to collusion with her."
00:30:21.600,00:30:24.710,华妃深受天恩 又心性果毅,00:30:22.180,00:30:26.000,Her Highness is endowed with a resolute mind ...
00:30:24.960,00:30:27.750,果毅 你觉得什么是果毅,00:30:26.000,00:30:29.260,"A resolute mind?
What do you mean by that?"
00:30:29.200,00:30:31.580,行事果敢 能掌事用人的,,,
00:30:31.960,00:30:32.830,便称为果毅,00:30:30.160,00:30:34.060,"Her Highness is a determined, effective
decision maker in the palace."
00:30:33.600,00:30:35.030,华妃娘娘协理六宫,,,
00:30:35.280,00:30:37.390,想来是当得起这两个字的,00:30:34.880,00:30:38.860,"I believe ""resolute"" can describe Her Highness
for her manner of managing the palace affairs."
00:30:37.920,00:30:39.310,凡事皆有两面,,,
00:30:40.080,00:30:42.430,太后行事一向有分寸,00:30:38.900,00:30:41.180,That is a double-edged sword.
00:30:42.840,00:30:44.550,后宫的事她从不多管,00:30:41.180,00:30:45.880,"The Empress Dowager makes no interference
of little necessity in the harem."
00:30:45.280,00:30:46.670,但只要管了,,,
00:30:47.000,00:30:48.910,必定是她看不过眼的大事,00:30:45.880,00:30:50.000,"But when she involves herself in,
it must be an intolerable matter of consequence to her."
00:30:49.800,00:30:53.340,此番严惩 就是告诫后宫,,,
00:30:53.720,00:30:55.950,不要再这样乌烟瘴气,00:30:51.000,00:30:57.500,"Her stem punishment aims to clear
the foul atmosphere in the harem."
00:30:57.520,00:31:00.830,臣妾只希望今后后宫中人,,,
00:31:01.120,00:31:03.310,都能够互相体谅 少些忌恨,00:30:58.160,00:31:04.640,"I humbly wish that there will be more
understanding and less begrudging in the harem"
00:31:04.000,00:31:06.110,这样皇上才能专心政事,,,
00:31:06.440,00:31:07.310,无后顾之忧,00:31:04.640,00:31:08.460,"so that Your Majesty can concentrate on the
state affairs with peace in your backyard."
00:31:13.640,00:31:16.430,今日早朝我看见你父亲咳了两声,,,
00:31:16.760,00:31:17.820,好像是受了风寒,00:31:14.760,00:31:19.340,"I heard your father coughing at court.
It seems that he caught a cold."
00:31:19.200,00:31:20.550,父亲一直有喉疾,,,
00:31:21.080,00:31:22.390,臣妾也担心得很,00:31:20.100,00:31:23.820,"He has been chronically suffering from
laryngeal disorders, which worries me a lot."
00:31:23.360,00:31:24.550,所以下了早朝,,,
00:31:24.960,00:31:25.790,朕就让苏培盛,,,
00:31:26.120,00:31:28.390,拿了两瓶蜜炼枇杷露给你父亲,00:31:23.820,00:31:29.760,I asked Su Peisheng to send him pei pa koa after court.
00:31:30.080,00:31:30.950,多谢皇上,00:31:31.000,00:31:32.720,I am very much obliged to Your Majesty.
00:31:32.800,00:31:35.670,他是你父亲 朕关心他是应该的,00:31:33.500,00:31:37.180,"He is your father.
It's also my obligation to care for him."
00:31:38.120,00:31:39.100,父亲喉疾,,,
00:31:39.560,00:31:41.860,也是臣妾母亲每日牵挂之事,00:31:38.900,00:31:43.340,His disease has never been less of a concern of my mother.
00:31:42.400,00:31:43.870,春日熬杏仁百合,,,
00:31:44.320,00:31:45.790,秋日蒸川贝白梨,00:31:43.340,00:31:47.440,"Almond lilly-root soup in the spring,
and steamed pear with fritillaria bulbs in the fall."
00:31:46.200,00:31:47.750,悉心照顾了许多年,,,
00:31:49.040,00:31:50.910,你父母伉俪情深,00:31:47.440,00:31:49.540,She's been taking good care of him over all these years.
00:31:51.880,00:31:55.110,所以生出的女儿才如此温婉多情,00:31:49.800,00:31:56.820,"They are a sweet loving couple.
That's why they have a sweet and loving daughter."
00:31:56.760,00:31:58.110,皇上取笑臣妾,00:31:57.800,00:31:59.860,Your Majesty is even sweeter.
00:32:02.640,00:32:06.590,娘 今天是您的忌日,00:32:04.300,00:32:08.800,"Mother, it is your death anniversary today."
00:32:08.760,00:32:10.350,不知道爹爹是否还记得,00:32:08.800,00:32:12.040,I wonder if father remembers.
00:32:12.000,00:32:13.310,是否和我一样,00:32:13.440,00:32:15.500,I wonder if he is ...
00:32:15.320,00:32:17.270,只能偷偷地给您烧纸钱,00:32:15.760,00:32:18.960,secretly burning joss paper like I am.
00:32:19.520,00:32:20.310,娘,00:32:20.000,00:32:21.400,Mother ...
00:32:21.480,00:32:22.510,女儿不孝,00:32:21.500,00:32:24.000,I am a useless daughter ...
00:32:25.120,00:32:26.670,不知道何年何月,,,
00:32:28.000,00:32:29.470,才能出人头地,00:32:25.520,00:32:31.160,I don't know when I will make a name for myself
00:32:31.640,00:32:34.270,才能正大光明地给您烧纸钱,00:32:32.900,00:32:36.560,and rightfully offer joss paper to you.
00:32:44.200,00:32:45.710,这么晚了 谁还会在那里,00:32:45.320,00:32:47.800,Who can it be at this time?
00:32:56.400,00:32:57.070,大胆,00:32:56.900,00:32:58.780,What is this?
00:32:57.800,00:32:59.790,皇宫禁地竟敢私烧纸钱,00:32:58.780,00:33:01.040,How dare you burn ghost money in the palace?
00:33:00.480,00:33:01.230,曹贵人,00:33:01.740,00:33:03.100,Lady Cao.
00:33:02.240,00:33:04.750,你 你不是莞贵人的宫女吗,00:33:04.080,00:33:06.340,You ... you are the maid of Lady Sourire?
00:33:07.760,00:33:08.710,你要知道,,,
00:33:09.040,00:33:11.670,在宫中最忌讳的便是不吉利的事,00:33:08.800,00:33:12.920,"You must know that
any ominous act is forbidden in the palace."
00:33:11.920,00:33:13.710,私烧纸钱更是大不敬,00:33:12.920,00:33:15.120,Burning joss paper is of major disrespect to His Majesty.
00:33:14.400,00:33:17.070,就算莞贵人知道了也保不住你,00:33:15.120,00:33:18.680,I'm afraid even she cannot save you from this.
00:33:17.480,00:33:19.630,曹贵人恕罪 奴婢再也不敢了,00:33:18.680,00:33:20.740,"I do beg your pardon, Lady Cao.
I promise this will never happen again."
00:33:19.920,00:33:21.670,千万不要把这件事情告诉小主,,,
00:33:22.080,00:33:23.470,罢了 起来吧,00:33:20.740,00:33:23.060,I beg of you not to tell My Lady.
00:33:24.320,00:33:25.380,请贵人恕罪,00:33:23.300,00:33:25.100,"All right, you may rise."
00:33:28.080,00:33:29.510,幸亏是遇到了我,00:33:25.600,00:33:27.300,"I beg of you to pardon me, Lady Cao."
00:33:30.040,00:33:31.230,若是换作旁人,00:33:28.960,00:33:30.900,You are lucky that it is me.
00:33:31.480,00:33:32.830,早拉你去慎刑司了,00:33:31.000,00:33:34.120,"You would be sent to the Department of Penalty
were you caught be someone else."
00:33:33.720,00:33:34.590,你老实告诉我,,,
00:33:35.040,00:33:36.390,为什么在这里烧纸钱,00:33:34.880,00:33:38.300,"Now tell me, why were you burning joss paper?"
00:33:38.120,00:33:39.750,今天是我娘的忌日,00:33:39.300,00:33:42.360,Today is the death anniversary of my mother.
00:33:42.520,00:33:43.950,倒难为你一片孝心,,,
00:33:44.960,00:33:46.230,既是要孝敬你娘,00:33:43.640,00:33:46.060,You are a very filial daughter.
00:33:46.680,00:33:48.670,你偷偷在碎玉轩烧也就罢了,00:33:46.060,00:33:49.500,"But you could have offered respect
to your mother in the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:33:49.000,00:33:50.060,怎么还跑出来了,00:33:49.500,00:33:51.660,Why did you have to come here?
00:33:51.160,00:33:51.990,奴婢不敢,,,
00:33:52.360,00:33:53.390,你们家莞贵人,00:33:51.660,00:33:53.260,I dared not.
00:33:53.800,00:33:55.350,不是向来最疼爱你吗,00:33:53.760,00:33:56.660,"You are the favorite maid of Lady Sourire, aren't you?"
00:33:55.640,00:33:57.470,连吃穿用都与旁人不同,00:33:56.660,00:33:59.040,She treats you differently from the other servants.
00:33:58.360,00:34:01.630,你的这点孝心她倒不肯成全你吗,00:33:59.200,00:34:03.040,Why wouldn't she allow you?
00:34:06.360,00:34:07.870,奴婢怕冲撞了小主,00:34:07.440,00:34:09.700,I dared not offend  My Lady.
00:34:10.520,00:34:11.230,今日之事,,,
00:34:11.560,00:34:13.350,还请贵人千万不要告诉小主,00:34:11.440,00:34:14.820,"I beg of you not to let her know, Lady Cao."
00:34:13.880,00:34:14.710,知道了,,,
00:34:16.040,00:34:17.750,还不快把这些东西扫了,00:34:14.820,00:34:16.460,I won't.
00:34:18.080,00:34:20.380,留下痕迹等人来抓你不是吗,00:34:17.340,00:34:22.100,"Clear the joss papper away quickly.
You shall not want to leave the slightest trace."
00:34:21.200,00:34:22.030,谢贵人,00:34:22.600,00:34:24.600,"Thank you, Lady Cao."
00:34:29.840,00:34:32.220,宝华殿的法师做了四场法事,00:34:30.000,00:34:31.100,[an account book]
00:34:32.640,00:34:35.270,共支出香火钱是一千八百两,00:34:31.260,00:34:36.520,"1800 taels was spent on the four exorcisms.
[tael is a measurement like ""dollar"" today]"
00:34:36.400,00:34:37.270,天气热了,,,
00:34:37.840,00:34:39.830,各宫各处的宫女 太监们,,,
00:34:40.080,00:34:42.070,添了晌午的一份绿豆汤解暑,00:34:36.520,00:34:47.000,"As it gets hot recently, an extra 32 taels
is spent daily on the mung bean soup for the servants."
00:34:42.360,00:34:45.670,每日所得的银钱是三十二两,,,
00:34:46.400,00:34:47.110,慢着,,,
00:34:48.320,00:34:50.750,一天的绿豆汤是三十二两,00:34:47.500,00:34:48.940,Hold on.
00:34:51.520,00:34:52.550,那一个月呢,00:34:49.000,00:34:53.820,"The mung bean soup costs 32 taels a day.
What about a month?"
00:34:54.720,00:35:00.070,一个月九百六十两,00:34:56.380,00:34:59.160,That will be ...
,,,00:34:59.500,00:35:01.340,960 taels.
00:35:01.280,00:35:04.550,富从俭中来 虽然是一碗绿豆汤,00:35:01.840,00:35:04.200,"""Wealth begins with frugality."""
00:35:04.760,00:35:06.510,但长年累月下来的话,,,
00:35:06.920,00:35:08.270,倒也是笔大数目,00:35:04.200,00:35:09.500,"A bowl of mung bean soup can accumulate to
prodigious numbers over time."
00:35:08.640,00:35:09.590,皇后说得是,00:35:09.620,00:35:11.800,"I agree,"
00:35:10.680,00:35:14.950,只是这笔开支从先帝手里就有了,00:35:11.900,00:35:16.300,but that has been defrayed since the prior emperor.
00:35:15.840,00:35:17.230,若是突然断了,,,
00:35:17.800,00:35:20.670,只怕底下人心中有怨言,00:35:16.500,00:35:22.220,I'm afraid the servants would complain if it's cut off.
00:35:21.440,00:35:22.630,皇上说得是,,,
00:35:23.040,00:35:24.150,主上恩遇,00:35:22.400,00:35:24.100,I agree with Your Majesty.
00:35:24.360,00:35:26.630,奴才们做事才尽力尽心,00:35:24.100,00:35:27.940,The servants will work with all their heart for a kind master.
00:35:26.920,00:35:28.990,这笔开支倒是省不得的,00:35:27.940,00:35:30.460,This is not an expense to be cut.
00:35:29.520,00:35:31.590,莞贵人 你怎么看,00:35:30.460,00:35:33.100,"Lady Sourire, what do you think?"
00:35:32.800,00:35:34.070,臣妾不懂这些,,,
00:35:35.080,00:35:36.300,眉姐姐只管算账,00:35:33.600,00:35:35.860,I know nothing about this.
00:35:36.600,00:35:38.310,那臣妾就只管喝茶了,00:35:35.900,00:35:39.840,I shall enjoy my tea while Meizhuang is doing all the math.
00:35:39.120,00:35:41.190,这便是最会享福的命了,00:35:40.000,00:35:42.780,All she needs to do is enjoy.
00:35:42.280,00:35:44.910,皇上 臣妾想着,,,
00:35:45.160,00:35:48.070,其实每日宫里的份例都用不完的,00:35:42.900,00:35:49.280,"Your Majesty, I reckon that the daily food ration
is unnecessarily high for each palace."
00:35:48.680,00:35:50.750,比方就贵人来说吧,00:35:49.500,00:35:52.300,"Take Noble Lady for example,"
00:35:51.240,00:35:53.510,每日陈粳米一升二合,00:35:52.540,00:35:54.720,"Every day, I receive 2 pt 7 oz of rice,"
00:35:53.880,00:35:56.390,猪肉六斤 鲜菜六斤,00:35:54.720,00:35:57.620,"6 catties of pork, 6 catties of vegetables
[6 catties ≈ 8 pounds]"
00:35:56.760,00:36:00.070,白面两斤 豆腐一斤八两,00:35:57.620,00:36:01.080,"2 catties of flour, and one and half catties of toufu."
00:36:00.320,00:36:02.430,便是怎么吃也吃不完的,00:36:01.080,00:36:03.700,That is too much to ever be consumed within a day.
00:36:02.680,00:36:05.390,就不用说嫔位和妃位的宫例了,00:36:03.700,00:36:06.460,No to mention the rations for Concubines and Consorts.
00:36:06.200,00:36:08.470,臣妾想着倒不如,,,
00:36:08.680,00:36:11.430,把这些都折了现银分给各个宫里,00:36:06.960,00:36:12.700,I would suggest we convert the surplus food into extra stipends.
00:36:11.800,00:36:13.390,绿豆和冰糖的例子,,,
00:36:13.600,00:36:16.270,也都折了现银分给各宫的奴才,00:36:12.700,00:36:17.420,"So the rations for mung bean soup
will be provided as extra pay for the servants."
00:36:16.760,00:36:18.510,一来省了开销,,,
00:36:18.840,00:36:20.710,二来也人人有份,00:36:17.700,00:36:19.740,That will make a saving from making the soup
00:36:21.240,00:36:23.700,省得大家你吃了我的,00:36:19.740,00:36:22.460,and everyone will have a fair share
00:36:24.040,00:36:26.470,我又吃了旁人的 总有抱怨,00:36:22.460,00:36:27.600,"instead of quibbling about people
having more soup than they do."
00:36:26.960,00:36:28.020,姐姐玲珑剔透,,,
00:36:28.800,00:36:29.940,换做是臣妾,,,
00:36:30.400,00:36:31.870,是断断算不了这些的,00:36:27.900,00:36:32.880,"That is a brilliant idea!
I can never calculate all that like Meizhuang."
00:36:33.160,00:36:34.300,臣妾头痛了,00:36:33.000,00:36:35.720,(laughing inwardly) It's giving me a headache.
00:36:34.760,00:36:37.950,幸亏有沈贵人计算 处处得力,00:36:35.720,00:36:39.260,"I'm thankful that Lady Shen
is helping me with the calculations."
00:36:38.480,00:36:39.910,臣妾哪懂什么,,,
00:36:40.120,00:36:42.500,若不是皇后娘娘处处提点着,00:36:39.260,00:36:41.340,Your Majesty flatters me.
00:36:42.800,00:36:45.390,臣妾早不知出了多少笑话了,00:36:41.340,00:36:46.640,"I would have made all the mistakes in the world
without Your Majesty's patient instructions."
00:36:46.200,00:36:49.190,你还年轻 该多历练,00:36:47.300,00:36:50.800,"You're new to managing the palace affairs.
Practice makes perfect."
00:36:50.240,00:36:55.070,只是这历练 也得有天赋性情的,00:36:51.000,00:36:56.480,And you also have a natural talent for the task.
00:36:56.240,00:36:59.670,那便是说臣妾了 天生是蠢笨,00:36:56.900,00:37:01.000,Your Majesty must be talking about my lack of talent.
00:37:01.360,00:37:02.710,你们看她这张嘴,,,
00:37:03.240,00:37:04.550,还说自个儿蠢笨,00:37:02.080,00:37:04.140,Look at that!
00:37:05.480,00:37:06.950,那别人怎么算呢,00:37:04.140,00:37:08.000,"What talent have we got
if she isn't counted as talented?"
00:37:07.360,00:37:09.740,依臣妾说皇上倒怪不着妹妹,,,
00:37:10.560,00:37:12.190,应该是怪皇上自己,00:37:08.200,00:37:13.200,I would say that Your Majesty only has yourself to blame
00:37:12.600,00:37:13.950,宠了妹妹这张嘴,,,
00:37:14.240,00:37:17.470,倒纵得她爱说什么便是什么了,00:37:13.360,00:37:18.700,for spoiling her to always speak her mind out loud.
00:37:29.800,00:37:32.150,奴才给华妃娘娘请安,00:37:30.760,00:37:33.300,I bow in respect before Your Highness.
00:37:32.320,00:37:33.150,起来吧,,,
00:37:33.560,00:37:34.350,谢娘娘,00:37:33.300,00:37:34.580,Rise.
,,,00:37:34.580,00:37:35.800,I thank Your Highness.
00:37:35.080,00:37:37.910,去禀报皇后 说本宫来请安,00:37:36.120,00:37:39.160,Tell the Empress that I'm here to pay my respect.
00:37:39.280,00:37:42.470,怎么 连娘娘都使唤不动你们了,00:37:40.100,00:37:43.820,What? Did you not hear Her Highness's order?
00:37:42.800,00:37:45.710,那便不必禀报了 本宫自己进去,00:37:43.820,00:37:46.960,That's okay. I'll see myself in.
00:37:46.680,00:37:49.990,娘娘 皇后娘娘今日风疾发作,00:37:47.820,00:37:52.480,"Her Majesty is having an episode of cephalalgia.
She's not able to see Your Highness."
00:37:50.360,00:37:51.230,不宜见客,,,
00:37:52.080,00:37:53.950,正因为皇后娘娘凤体违和,,,
00:37:54.320,00:37:55.540,本宫才来请安的,00:37:53.440,00:37:56.780,That is why I come to see her.
,,,00:37:56.800,00:37:58.560,(emperor laughing)
00:38:00.920,00:38:03.270,娘娘凤体违和 兴致倒好,00:38:00.500,00:38:04.940,(snort) She seems to be in a good mood.
00:38:03.720,00:38:06.180,皇上来看望娘娘,00:38:05.000,00:38:07.420,Because His Majesty came to visit Her Majesty.
00:38:06.480,00:38:09.350,那正好 本宫顺道向皇上请安,,,
00:38:09.880,00:38:11.870,也免得再跑一趟养心殿了,00:38:07.700,00:38:13.300,"Very well then, it will save me
the trip to pay respect to His Majesty."
00:38:12.560,00:38:13.540,娘娘万安,00:38:13.460,00:38:14.720,Peace to Your Highness.
00:38:14.960,00:38:17.750,今日皇后娘娘是否凤体违和,00:38:15.500,00:38:20.080,"It is of no consequence whether
Her Majesty is feeling unwell or not today."
00:38:18.120,00:38:18.910,都不要紧,,,
00:38:19.160,00:38:21.870,重要的是皇上看到娘娘,,,
00:38:22.200,00:38:24.710,是否会动怒 圣体违和,00:38:20.080,00:38:25.860,"What matters is whether His Majesty
will feel unwell when he sees Your Highness."
00:38:25.280,00:38:26.630,娘娘是聪明人,,,
00:38:26.880,00:38:29.590,自然知道圣意是何等的要紧,00:38:26.000,00:38:30.780,"I believe Your Highness does understand
the consequence of that."
00:38:30.040,00:38:32.600,您又何苦去惹皇上不痛快呢,00:38:30.800,00:38:33.880,Why would you rather displease His Majesty?
00:38:41.920,00:38:43.390,恭送娘娘,00:38:43.000,00:38:45.580,(loudly) I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:38:53.640,00:38:55.910,启禀娘娘 曹贵人来了,00:38:54.640,00:38:57.420,"Your Highness, Lady Cao is here."
00:39:03.840,00:39:04.950,娘娘吉祥,00:39:04.500,00:39:06.200,Peace to Your Highness.
00:39:10.440,00:39:13.590,夏日炎炎 娘娘心中难免有火,00:39:11.200,00:39:15.160,"The scorching weather must be
driving Your Highness into a temper."
00:39:14.200,00:39:15.510,只要娘娘能消气,,,
00:39:15.800,00:39:17.510,嫔妾愿受一切责罚,00:39:15.160,00:39:18.840,"I am willing to take any punishment
for Your Highness to vent out the anger."
00:39:18.440,00:39:19.580,当年你不过就是个,,,
00:39:19.960,00:39:21.070,破落户家的秀女,00:39:20.040,00:39:22.600,You were just a girl selected from a hopeless family!
00:39:21.680,00:39:23.070,留了牌子送到王府,,,
00:39:23.360,00:39:24.500,连皇上面都见不上,00:39:22.900,00:39:25.940,You didn't even get to see His Majesty when you moved in.
00:39:25.320,00:39:27.550,若不是本宫提拔你伺候皇上,00:39:26.300,00:39:28.760,"If it were not for my help,"
00:39:27.960,00:39:30.260,你哪有机会生下公主成为贵人,00:39:28.760,00:39:31.800,how could you have a daughter and get upgraded?
00:39:31.360,00:39:33.310,现在本宫跟丽嫔有难,00:39:32.000,00:39:34.580,Now I and Concubine Beauté are in a crisis
00:39:33.920,00:39:36.110,你乱出主意闯下大祸,00:39:34.580,00:39:37.340,because of your fantastic idea.
00:39:36.440,00:39:38.630,还有脸在本宫面前说这些,00:39:37.340,00:39:39.800,How did you have the cheek to say all that?
00:39:39.360,00:39:40.670,嫔妾不知错在哪里,,,
00:39:41.320,00:39:42.430,还请娘娘明示,00:39:40.000,00:39:43.780,"I hope Your Highness will
enlighten me what I have done wrong."
00:39:42.760,00:39:44.230,嫔妾定领责罚,00:39:43.780,00:39:45.300,I will take all the punishment.
00:39:45.600,00:39:46.950,本宫听了你的,,,
00:39:47.600,00:39:50.270,先去告知太后丽嫔疯癫之事,00:39:46.060,00:39:53.540,"You told me to preempt suspicion
by informing the Empress Dowager."
00:39:50.680,00:39:52.070,以求撇清干系,,,
00:39:52.960,00:39:54.950,丽嫔废入冷宫不足为惜,00:39:53.800,00:39:56.400,"I don't care that Concubine Beauté
was banished to the Cold Palace."
00:39:55.480,00:39:57.940,却害得本宫失去协理六宫之权,00:39:56.400,00:39:59.140,But I lost my authority to manage the harem.
00:39:58.560,00:40:00.390,还不都是你自以为是,,,
00:40:00.720,00:40:01.780,出的好谋算吗,00:39:59.500,00:40:03.280,"Wasn't it because you were
so up yourself with your brilliant idea?"
00:40:04.120,00:40:06.310,恭喜娘娘 贺喜娘娘,00:40:04.880,00:40:07.700,I wish to congratulate Your Highness.
00:40:08.160,00:40:11.670,你倒说说这喜从何来呀,00:40:07.800,00:40:12.920,(snort) What is there for you to congratulate on?
00:40:12.480,00:40:15.110,丽嫔说得再多也只是疯言疯语,00:40:13.500,00:40:16.560,"Whatever Concubine Beauté uttered
were just considered as mad talks."
00:40:15.720,00:40:17.270,太后与皇上再疑心,,,
00:40:17.640,00:40:18.860,也只是口说无凭,00:40:16.560,00:40:20.200,"Whatever His Majesty suspected
could not be grounded in any evidence."
00:40:19.400,00:40:20.950,娘娘眼下虽然失权,,,
00:40:21.280,00:40:22.340,倒能够明哲保身,00:40:20.200,00:40:23.520,"Although Your Highness is temporarily down from power,
you were able to keep yourself safe."
00:40:23.200,00:40:26.550,况且 皇上是一个念情念旧的人,00:40:24.000,00:40:27.800,His Majesty has an affectionate nature.
00:40:27.000,00:40:29.510,得失只在皇上一念之间罢了,00:40:27.800,00:40:30.600,"Your reinstatement relies on
His Majesty's take on the issue."
00:40:29.800,00:40:30.990,说得倒轻巧,,,
00:40:31.800,00:40:33.910,如今莞贵人迷了皇上心窍,00:40:30.700,00:40:32.800,Easy for you to say!
00:40:34.720,00:40:36.670,皇后从中作梗,00:40:32.960,00:40:37.940,"Now that His Majesty is possessed by Lady Sourire,
with the Empress placing barriers in the way,"
00:40:37.120,00:40:40.390,现在本宫连见皇上一面都难了,00:40:37.940,00:40:41.880,I don't even have a chance to see His Majesty.
00:40:40.800,00:40:41.830,娘娘贤德,,,
00:40:42.720,00:40:44.830,嫔妾愿为娘娘效犬马之劳,00:40:41.900,00:40:47.000,"I will exert the utmost effort to mend
Your Highness's fences with His Majesty."
00:40:45.160,00:40:45.950,从中劝和,,,
00:40:46.160,00:40:47.110,就凭你,,,
00:40:49.480,00:40:51.030,皇上舐犊情深,00:40:47.000,00:40:49.080,By what means?
00:40:51.600,00:40:53.430,温宜颇受皇上怜爱,00:40:50.500,00:40:54.780,His Majesty adores Princess Wenyi.
00:41:02.280,00:41:04.070,起来吧 赐座,00:41:03.000,00:41:05.880,Rise. Give her a seat.
00:41:04.960,00:41:06.070,多谢娘娘,00:41:06.000,00:41:07.800,I thank Your Highness.
00:41:13.720,00:41:16.510,丽嫔是绣花枕头 中看不中用,00:41:14.500,00:41:17.920,Concubine Beauté is as useless as a glass hammer.
00:41:17.080,00:41:20.030,说来到底是你有福气些,,,
00:41:20.480,00:41:22.270,身旁有女傍身,00:41:17.920,00:41:23.400,But you are much more fortunate to have a daughter.
00:41:23.200,00:41:26.550,总比本宫膝下无依好得多,00:41:24.200,00:41:27.980,"Unlike me, having no child to depend upon."
00:41:26.920,00:41:29.670,嫔妾无德无能 若无娘娘庇护,,,
00:41:29.880,00:41:31.550,公主哪得平安成长,00:41:28.000,00:41:32.500,"I am nobody in the palace.
Wenyi grew up peacefully under Your Highness's protection."
00:41:32.160,00:41:33.910,娘娘向来疼爱温宜,00:41:33.000,00:41:35.200,Your Highness loves Wenyi dearly.
00:41:34.320,00:41:35.230,温宜长大后,,,
00:41:35.480,00:41:37.940,定视娘娘如生母 孝顺娘娘,00:41:35.200,00:41:39.080,"She will be a filial daughter to
Your Highness when she grows up."
00:41:38.200,00:41:39.030,瞧你,00:41:39.100,00:41:40.600,"Look at you,"
00:41:39.640,00:41:42.020,头发都散了 还陪着本宫说话,00:41:40.600,00:41:43.240,too immersed in the conversation to tend to your hair.
00:41:42.880,00:41:43.940,难为你了,00:41:43.400,00:41:44.960,I was being hard on you.
00:41:44.400,00:41:44.990,颂芝,,,
00:41:45.440,00:41:46.070,是,00:41:45.300,00:41:47.600,"- Song Zhi.

00:41:46.320,00:41:48.230,带曹贵人到后面梳妆更衣,00:41:47.600,00:41:49.640,Attend to Lady Cao's hair in my room.
00:41:49.200,00:41:49.830,是,00:41:49.640,00:41:51.180,Yes.
00:41:51.960,00:41:53.270,多谢娘娘,00:41:52.540,00:41:54.560,I thank Your Highness.
00:41:53.640,00:41:56.200,皇上有日子没见到温宜了吧,00:41:54.700,00:41:57.620,His Majesty hasn't seen Wenyi for a while.
00:41:57.720,00:42:00.670,带温宜去景仁宫给皇上请安吧,00:41:58.000,00:42:02.020,"You should bring her to see His Majesty
at the Palace of Great Benevolence."
00:42:01.160,00:42:04.510,是 只是嫔妾不善言辞,00:42:02.020,00:42:03.440,"I'd like to,"
00:42:05.000,00:42:06.630,怕惹皇上厌烦,00:42:03.440,00:42:07.700,"but I'm afraid I'll get in His Majesty's
bad graces for my inarticulateness."
00:42:07.160,00:42:09.270,你不善言辞没关系,,,
00:42:09.760,00:42:12.110,只要温宜会笑会闹就行,00:42:07.900,00:42:13.520,"You don't have to talk.
You'll just need Wenyi to smile."
00:42:12.880,00:42:13.990,本宫妆台上,,,
00:42:14.320,00:42:16.310,有支凤穿芍药的步摇,00:42:13.700,00:42:17.740,There is a phoenix hairpin on my dresser.
00:42:17.520,00:42:18.910,你把它戴上了去,00:42:17.740,00:42:21.040,Put it on.
