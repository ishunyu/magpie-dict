00:02:21.280,00:02:24.390,愿太后凤体康健 福泽万年,00:02:21.540,00:02:24.680,We wish Your Majesty good health and eternal blessings.
00:02:25.480,00:02:27.270,许久不见莞贵人了,00:02:25.660,00:02:27.640,I haven't seen Lady Sourire for some time.
00:02:27.720,00:02:29.470,抬起头来 哀家瞧瞧,00:02:27.860,00:02:30.300,Raise your head and let me look at you.
00:02:34.800,00:02:35.670,都起来吧,00:02:34.980,00:02:36.300,All rise.
00:02:36.640,00:02:37.630,谢太后,00:02:36.940,00:02:38.960,We thank Your Majesty.
00:02:40.800,00:02:42.030,莞贵人很懂事,00:02:40.820,00:02:42.840,Lady Sourire not only has good manners
00:02:42.920,00:02:44.790,而且性情也很和顺,00:02:43.060,00:02:45.520,but also a gentle nature.
00:02:49.640,00:02:51.310,臣妾甄嬛拜见太后,00:02:49.900,00:02:51.880,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:02:51.720,00:02:53.390,请太后再受臣妾大礼,00:02:52.000,00:02:53.960,Allow me to kneel to greet Your Majesty.
00:02:53.880,00:02:55.030,臣妾喜不自胜,00:02:53.960,00:02:55.860,I rejoice at seeing Your Majesty.
00:02:56.760,00:02:59.270,很好 的确很懂事,00:02:56.940,00:02:59.960,Very well. You are well-mannered indeed.
00:03:00.080,00:03:01.270,臣妾年轻鲁莽,00:03:00.180,00:03:01.820,I am young and unschooled.
00:03:01.680,00:03:03.390,幸好有太后恩泽庇佑,00:03:01.860,00:03:03.740,Blessed by Your Majesty's grace
00:03:03.640,00:03:05.670,皇后与诸位姐姐又肯教导臣妾,00:03:03.820,00:03:05.900,"and the teachings from Her Majesty and the other concubines,"
00:03:06.200,00:03:07.110,才不至失仪,00:03:06.280,00:03:07.840,I have not behaved improperly.
00:03:07.720,00:03:11.070,不怪皇上喜欢你 哀家也喜欢,00:03:07.980,00:03:11.780,"No wonder the emperor likes you. I like you, too."
00:03:12.520,00:03:14.390,竹息 是,00:03:12.780,00:03:14.580,"-Bamboo.
-Yes."
00:03:14.680,00:03:16.870,取两匹云锦赐予莞贵人,00:03:14.580,00:03:17.120,Get two pieces of cloud brocade for Lady Sourire.
00:03:18.520,00:03:19.430,多谢太后,00:03:18.580,00:03:20.400,I am grateful to Your Majesty.
00:03:20.640,00:03:21.870,会不会写字啊,00:03:20.680,00:03:22.120,Can you write?
00:03:22.160,00:03:24.950,莞贵人才情甚好也通诗书,00:03:22.200,00:03:25.080,"Lady Sourire is highly educated and
well versed in poetry and history."
00:03:25.760,00:03:28.550,臣妾略通诗书 只是字迹拙劣,00:03:25.780,00:03:27.520,I have inadequately studied poetry and history.
00:03:28.840,00:03:29.950,怕入不得太后的眼,00:03:27.540,00:03:30.400,"But my handwriting may be too inferior
to be of any use to Your Majesty."
00:03:31.240,00:03:32.430,会写就好,00:03:30.680,00:03:32.840,It's good that you can write.
00:03:33.280,00:03:36.070,你有空常来寿康宫陪伴哀家,00:03:33.340,00:03:36.020,"When you have time,"
00:03:37.160,00:03:38.910,替哀家抄写经文吧,00:03:37.020,00:03:39.780,come here and copy some sutras for me.
00:03:39.960,00:03:41.830,只要太后不嫌弃臣妾粗笨,00:03:40.180,00:03:42.280,"If Your Majesty is not troubled by my coarseness,"
00:03:42.200,00:03:44.030,臣妾愿意尽心侍奉太后,00:03:42.300,00:03:44.880,it will be my great pleasure to serve Your Majesty.
00:03:52.560,00:03:54.030,日日让你来抄经,,,
00:03:54.520,00:03:56.630,你自己得空的工夫倒是少了,00:03:52.680,00:03:57.040,"You've been here one day after another.
Now you have less time to yourself."
00:03:58.960,00:04:00.230,能为太后抄经,,,
00:04:00.680,00:04:01.870,是臣妾的福气,00:03:59.160,00:04:02.400,I am honored to copy sutras for Your Majesty.
00:04:07.880,00:04:11.390,雪下得这么大 树枝都压断了,00:04:08.100,00:04:12.160,Heavy snow broke the tree branches in the courtyard.
00:04:14.120,00:04:15.550,你这孩子心倒静,00:04:14.220,00:04:16.480,But you were able to write in peace.
00:04:16.640,00:04:19.110,哀家瞧你也很少讲话,00:04:16.800,00:04:19.340,I find that you're very quiet in general.
00:04:20.200,00:04:21.230,原本心不静,,,
00:04:22.080,00:04:23.870,到了太后这里抄写佛经,00:04:20.200,00:04:25.520,"My mind wasn't at peace, but copying
sutras for Your Majesty calmed my mind."
00:04:24.240,00:04:25.550,心就慢慢静下来了,,,
00:04:27.040,00:04:28.390,可见安神宁心,,,
00:04:28.760,00:04:30.590,佛祖真言是最好不过了,00:04:27.220,00:04:31.240,Nothing brings more peace than the words of the Buddha.
00:04:33.360,00:04:34.190,抄好了吗,00:04:33.600,00:04:34.880,Have you finished?
00:04:34.880,00:04:35.750,快好了,00:04:35.000,00:04:36.360,Almost.
00:04:54.800,00:04:56.150,太后也喜欢檀香吗,00:04:54.720,00:04:57.320,Your Majesty also likes sandalwood?
00:04:57.720,00:04:59.550,礼佛之人多用檀香,00:04:57.900,00:05:00.300,I burn it as an offering the Buddha.
00:05:01.360,00:05:04.430,后宫少用此香怎么你倒识得,00:05:01.680,00:05:05.220,"It's rarely used in the harem.
How do you recognize the incense?"
00:05:05.400,00:05:06.950,臣妾有时点来静静心,00:05:05.600,00:05:08.540,"I light it for myself sometimes.
It's more calming than benzoin resin."
00:05:07.320,00:05:08.310,倒比安息香好,,,
00:05:08.760,00:05:11.790,没错 人生难免不如意时,00:05:08.800,00:05:11.720,That's right. Life has its ups and downs.
00:05:12.200,00:05:13.630,你懂得排遣就好,00:05:12.340,00:05:15.340,I'm glad you know how to put your mind at peace.
00:05:19.360,00:05:20.790,朕不是说要过来吗,,,
00:05:21.200,00:05:22.550,你怎么这么早就睡下了,00:05:19.460,00:05:23.340,I said I'm coming tonight. Why did you go to bed early?
00:05:23.920,00:05:25.630,可是在皇额娘宫里,,,
00:05:26.080,00:05:27.710,抄佛经抄得累了,00:05:24.020,00:05:27.840,Are you tired from copying the sutras?
00:05:29.320,00:05:30.550,哪就这么娇弱,00:05:29.480,00:05:31.700,I'm not that delicate.
00:05:33.280,00:05:35.270,不过是等皇上等久了,,,
00:05:35.720,00:05:37.230,怕冷又犯困,00:05:33.560,00:05:37.640,I was just feeling cold and sleepy waiting for Your Majesty.
00:05:38.000,00:05:39.870,批了几本折子就过了时辰,00:05:38.060,00:05:40.420,I lost track of time when I was going through the memorandums.
00:05:40.400,00:05:41.230,是朕的不是,00:05:40.500,00:05:41.800,It's my fault.
00:05:41.880,00:05:43.310,天寒地冻的雪又大,,,
00:05:43.720,00:05:45.790,臣妾以为皇上会就近,00:05:41.800,00:05:47.380,"It's cold and snowy tonight. I thought Your Majesty
would go to Her Majesty's palace since it's close by."
00:05:46.120,00:05:47.550,去皇后娘娘宫中歇息呢,,,
00:05:48.120,00:05:50.270,朕前儿才留宿景仁宫,00:05:48.220,00:05:50.580,I just stayed at the Palace of Great Benevolence the day before.
00:05:50.640,00:05:51.430,你又劝朕去,00:05:50.580,00:05:52.820,Why are you telling me to go again?
00:05:53.040,00:05:55.430,天冷了 年下事情又多,00:05:53.200,00:05:55.680,It's cold recently and Her Majesty is busy at the year end.
00:05:56.240,00:05:58.390,皇后娘娘身子怕有些不痛快,00:05:56.480,00:05:59.300,Her Majesty might be feeling under the weather.
00:05:59.280,00:06:00.510,皇上该多去陪陪,00:05:59.420,00:06:01.580,Your Majesty should spend more time with her.
00:06:02.080,00:06:03.310,昨儿臣妾去请安,,,
00:06:03.800,00:06:05.950,还看见皇后娘娘画了幅寒梅图,00:06:02.160,00:06:06.300,"When I paid my respects to Her Majesty yesterday,
I saw her new painting of the winter plums."
00:06:06.480,00:06:07.470,皇上可瞧见了,00:06:06.540,00:06:07.900,Has Your Majesty seen it yet?
,,,00:06:07.900,00:06:09.680,I haven't.
00:06:07.720,00:06:12.510,没有 朕明日去陪皇后午膳吧,00:06:09.680,00:06:13.540,I will have lunch with her tomorrow and have a look.
00:06:12.760,00:06:13.670,顺道一观,,,
00:06:14.440,00:06:15.550,皇上只用午膳,,,
00:06:16.320,00:06:17.990,皇后娘娘还要费心安排,00:06:14.620,00:06:18.400,Her Majesty would put a great deal of effort into a midday meal..
00:06:19.960,00:06:21.190,倒不如去用晚膳,00:06:19.840,00:06:21.640,Perhaps Your Majesty could have dinner with Her Majesty instead?
00:06:21.600,00:06:22.790,便能歇在景仁宫了,00:06:21.640,00:06:23.540,Then Your Majesty will able to stay at the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:06:23.600,00:06:24.910,朕的嬛嬛这么大方,00:06:23.600,00:06:25.960,My Huan Huan is so generous.
00:06:27.800,00:06:29.510,皇后娘娘是一国之母,00:06:27.880,00:06:29.940,Her Majesty is the mother of the country.
00:06:30.040,00:06:31.550,皇上应该多去陪陪她,00:06:30.040,00:06:31.900,Your Majesty should spend more time with her.
00:06:32.280,00:06:35.870,你既如此贤德 朕明日去就是了,00:06:32.280,00:06:35.880,That's a very kind request. I will go tomorrow.
00:06:40.240,00:06:43.070,给皇后娘娘请安 娘娘万福金安,00:06:40.240,00:06:43.070,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:06:43.520,00:06:44.510,起来赐座,00:06:43.520,00:06:44.960,Rise. Have a seat.
00:06:44.880,00:06:45.910,谢皇后娘娘,00:06:44.960,00:06:46.620,I thank Your Majesty.
00:06:47.720,00:06:50.110,你们今天怎么了好像约定的,00:06:47.720,00:06:49.160,What is going on today?
00:06:50.480,00:06:51.870,来的时间都差不多,00:06:49.260,00:06:52.320,Everyone arrived almost at the same time as if it was planned.
00:06:52.880,00:06:53.990,今儿倒是真巧,00:06:53.060,00:06:55.400,How coincidental!
00:06:56.160,00:06:58.630,这几日天冷 你身子可好些了,00:06:56.160,00:06:58.900,It's very cold lately. Have you been feeling better?
00:06:59.360,00:07:01.790,好多了 多谢姐姐费心,00:06:59.360,00:07:02.280,I feel much better. Thank you for asking.
00:07:06.400,00:07:07.590,让姐姐见笑了,00:07:06.480,00:07:08.200,Excuse me.
00:07:08.280,00:07:09.750,原本只是风寒而已,00:07:08.280,00:07:10.100,"It was just a cold,"
00:07:10.120,00:07:12.270,却不知拖了那么久还不好,00:07:10.120,00:07:12.660,but it's taking me so long to get over it.
00:07:13.640,00:07:16.390,你们听听 这一风寒呀,00:07:13.640,00:07:15.360,Did anyone notice?
00:07:16.840,00:07:17.990,安常在的声音,00:07:15.540,00:07:20.200,"Because of the cold, Attendant An's voice is not as beautiful as before."
00:07:18.440,00:07:20.190,真不如从前好早了,,,
00:07:20.920,00:07:22.390,莞姐姐只顾看着安姐姐,00:07:20.920,00:07:22.840,Sourire only cares about An.
00:07:22.720,00:07:24.710,也不理我 我也是你的妹妹呀,00:07:22.840,00:07:24.960,You were ignoring me. I'm your sister too.
00:07:25.040,00:07:27.310,是啊 你自然是我的妹妹,00:07:25.040,00:07:27.320,"Yes, yes you are."
00:07:27.760,00:07:29.550,在座何尝不都是姐妹呢,00:07:27.760,00:07:30.040,Everyone is a sister to one another here.
00:07:30.480,00:07:33.310,莞姐姐 你瞧我今日又长胖了,00:07:30.480,00:07:33.640,"Sourire, look, I put on some weight again."
00:07:33.840,00:07:36.310,这刚做的衣服袖口就紧了,00:07:33.840,00:07:36.320,I've outgrown clothes that were just recently made.
00:07:36.520,00:07:39.750,是啊 早膳是两碗米粥三个糖包,00:07:36.520,00:07:39.750,"I'm not surprised. Two bowls of porridge
and three sugar buns for breakfast."
00:07:40.160,00:07:41.350,午膳是肥鸡肥鸭,00:07:40.160,00:07:41.900,Succulent chicken and duck for lunch.
00:07:41.760,00:07:43.230,不到晚膳又用了点心,00:07:41.900,00:07:43.520,Snacks before dinner.
00:07:43.600,00:07:44.870,晚膳要不是我拦着,,,
00:07:45.160,00:07:46.750,恐怕那整碗火腿炖肘子,00:07:43.600,00:07:48.640,"If I didn't stop you, you would have devoured the entire
pot of ham and pigs feet at dinner."
00:07:47.080,00:07:48.390,就全到你肚子里去了,,,
00:07:48.920,00:07:50.070,饶是这样还嚷着饿,,,
00:07:50.320,00:07:52.710,又吃了宵夜 不是怕吃不起,00:07:48.920,00:07:51.560,Yet you were still hungry and shouting for late night snacks.
00:07:53.120,00:07:53.790,而是怕你这肚子,00:07:51.560,00:07:55.800,"I'm more concerned about your swelling
stomach than the swelling food expenses."
00:07:54.200,00:07:55.470,吃得越发圆滚了,,,
00:07:56.000,00:07:57.390,姐姐越发爱笑话我了,00:07:56.000,00:07:57.840,You are always making fun of me!
00:07:57.960,00:07:59.230,不过姐姐说得也是,00:07:57.960,00:07:59.520,"But you are right,"
00:07:59.600,00:08:00.750,我不能再这么吃了,00:07:59.600,00:08:01.120,I must stop eating like this.
00:08:01.280,00:08:02.790,皇上都说我现在的衣裳,00:08:01.280,00:08:04.280,"His Majesty said they have to make
new clothes for me every two months."
00:08:03.160,00:08:04.270,每两个月就要新做,,,
00:08:04.560,00:08:06.230,不是长高了就是长胖了,00:08:04.560,00:08:06.620,I'm either getting taller or bigger.
00:08:07.720,00:08:09.910,我倒是羡慕像安姐姐这个样子,00:08:07.720,00:08:09.920,I wish I could be like An.
00:08:10.320,00:08:11.270,可以如此清瘦,00:08:10.320,00:08:11.960,She's so thin.
00:08:12.720,00:08:14.390,胖一点又有什么关系,00:08:12.720,00:08:14.640,There's nothing wrong with gaining a little weight.
00:08:14.760,00:08:15.870,皇上喜欢就可以了,00:08:14.760,00:08:16.360,As long as His Majesty likes it.
00:08:16.560,00:08:18.710,反而你的安姐姐还羡慕着你,00:08:16.560,00:08:19.960,"Rather, Attendant An is jealous that you have a healthy appetite."
00:08:19.040,00:08:19.950,可以吃这么多,,,
00:08:20.600,00:08:24.350,你呀 看你这么清瘦总是不好,00:08:20.600,00:08:24.440,"Lingrong, you are slim and delicate."
00:08:24.880,00:08:25.870,你需要吃药,,,
00:08:26.200,00:08:28.070,可是也要注意调理才是啊,00:08:24.880,00:08:28.800,"In addition to your medicine, you should eat more nourishing food."
00:08:31.200,00:08:32.510,多谢娘娘关怀,00:08:31.380,00:08:33.280,I thank Your Majesty.
00:08:33.560,00:08:35.870,我原是没有淳妹妹这样好的福气,00:08:33.560,00:08:36.180,I'm not as fortunate as Chun'er.
00:08:36.800,00:08:40.950,能吃是福有人挂记也是福,00:08:36.800,00:08:40.960,"She's fortunate to have a good appetite,
and to be cared for."
00:08:42.200,00:08:43.230,你看你莞姐姐,,,
00:08:43.680,00:08:45.310,连你平日里吃多少东西,00:08:42.400,00:08:47.620,"Chun'er, Sourire cares about you so much.
She remembers everything you eat."
00:08:46.520,00:08:47.550,她都放在心上,,,
00:08:51.920,00:08:53.950,好了先坐下来吧,00:08:51.920,00:08:53.960,"All right, take a seat."
00:08:54.720,00:08:55.350,是,00:08:54.900,00:08:56.120,Yes.
00:08:59.560,00:09:01.710,富察贵人你是怎么了,00:08:59.560,00:09:01.720,"Lady Fuca, are you all right?"
00:09:01.960,00:09:03.430,可是早膳吃了不干净的东西,00:09:01.960,00:09:04.600,Did you eat something unclean?
00:09:03.720,00:09:04.590,身子不舒服,,,
00:09:05.560,00:09:06.710,回禀皇后娘娘,,,
00:09:07.040,00:09:09.630,小主不是吃坏了东西 是有喜了,00:09:05.720,00:09:08.880,"Your Majesty, My Lady didn't eat unclean food."
,,,00:09:08.880,00:09:09.960,My Lady is with child.
00:09:10.000,00:09:10.750,不许浑说,00:09:10.040,00:09:11.360,Nonsense.
00:09:11.920,00:09:16.150,是真的吗 那太好了 是喜事啊,00:09:11.920,00:09:16.160,Is it true? That's wonderful news!
00:09:17.000,00:09:18.590,要给皇上道贺了,00:09:17.220,00:09:19.300,We all need to congratulate His Majesty.
00:09:19.040,00:09:22.070,当真有了 找太医瞧过了吗,00:09:19.300,00:09:22.280,"You're with child?
Was it confirmed by an imperial doctor?"
00:09:22.680,00:09:24.830,两位太医都来瞧过了,00:09:22.680,00:09:24.840,Two doctors have confirmed it.
00:09:25.160,00:09:26.110,我可不是那种,,,
00:09:26.360,00:09:28.390,为了争宠不择手段的人,00:09:25.160,00:09:28.390,"I'm not the type who would stoop to anything
to gain His Majesty's favor."
00:09:28.680,00:09:30.470,有就是有 无就是无,00:09:28.680,00:09:30.680,"Yes means yes, no means no."
00:09:30.800,00:09:32.390,皇嗣的事怎可作假,00:09:30.760,00:09:32.800,Why would I lie about an imperial heir?
00:09:33.120,00:09:35.310,有了一个沈答应做例子还不够吗,00:09:33.120,00:09:35.440,Isn't Companion Shen's example enough?
00:09:35.840,00:09:37.750,莞贵人您说是不是啊,00:09:35.840,00:09:38.380,"Lady Sourire, don't you agree?"
00:09:41.200,00:09:42.830,到底是富察姐姐有福气,00:09:41.480,00:09:43.660,Lady Fuca is truly blessed.
00:09:43.520,00:09:45.310,三五日间就有喜了,00:09:43.660,00:09:45.580,She had good news very quickly.
00:09:45.800,00:09:47.070,我记得皇上这阵子,,,
00:09:47.400,00:09:49.110,是没空陪富察贵人的,00:09:45.800,00:09:49.120,I recall His Majesty has been busy recently.
00:09:49.800,00:09:51.950,几个月才召幸妹妹一次,00:09:49.800,00:09:53.560,"His Majesty only visited you every
few months and you got pregnant."
00:09:52.360,00:09:53.390,妹妹就有了,,,
00:09:53.760,00:09:55.230,妹妹真是有福气的人,00:09:53.680,00:09:55.340,How blessed you are!
00:09:55.480,00:09:57.910,可不是呢 这是天赐的福气,00:09:55.400,00:09:58.700,"Indeed, this is a blessing bestowed by Heaven.
[Heaven also refers to an emperor]"
00:09:58.240,00:09:59.990,说不准还是位阿哥呢,00:09:58.800,00:10:00.480,They say it could be a prince.
00:10:00.920,00:10:03.230,欣常在您说是不是啊,00:10:00.920,00:10:03.240,"Attendant Joie, what do you think?"
00:10:03.800,00:10:06.230,这生儿生女呀 是天注定,00:10:03.800,00:10:06.460,Heaven determines whether it is a boy or a girl.
00:10:06.800,00:10:08.430,这生阿哥的福气呀,00:10:06.800,00:10:10.560,The fortune of conceiving a prince does not land on everyone.
00:10:08.960,00:10:10.550,指不定是谁有呢,,,
00:10:10.920,00:10:13.190,好了 生儿生女都好,00:10:10.920,00:10:13.190,"All right, a girl is as good as a boy."
00:10:13.560,00:10:15.830,富察贵人 你好不容易有了龙种,00:10:13.560,00:10:17.480,"Lady Fuca, you must take care of your health when bearing an imperial heir."
00:10:16.120,00:10:17.350,要好好养着身体,,,
00:10:17.840,00:10:19.790,断不能出什么差借,00:10:17.840,00:10:20.140,There mustn't be any oversights.
00:10:20.360,00:10:21.630,谢皇后娘娘,00:10:20.360,00:10:22.140,I thank your Majesty.
00:10:29.480,00:10:33.790,莞贵人做姐姐的愚钝,00:10:29.560,00:10:31.640,Noble Lady Sourire!
00:10:34.120,00:10:34.990,有一事不明,00:10:33.120,00:10:35.480,There's something my dull-witted mind cannot comprehend.
00:10:35.320,00:10:36.870,还想请教一下莞贵人,00:10:35.480,00:10:37.500,I wish to ask you a question.
00:10:37.600,00:10:38.510,姐姐问便是,00:10:37.800,00:10:39.560,I am all ears.
00:10:39.600,00:10:41.310,我真是替妹妹感到惋惜,00:10:39.760,00:10:41.820,I am full of pity for you.
00:10:42.000,00:10:43.710,要说皇上最宠爱妹妹了,00:10:42.180,00:10:44.300,"To be honest, you are the most favored"
00:10:44.200,00:10:46.350,妹妹所承的雨露自然也最多,00:10:44.300,00:10:46.720,and the most visited concubine of His Majesty.
00:10:47.080,00:10:49.470,怎么到了这会儿还没动静啊,00:10:47.340,00:10:50.080,How do you still not have good news for us?
00:10:50.360,00:10:51.870,眼下富察贵人有了孕,00:10:50.340,00:10:52.400,"Now that Lady Fuca is with child,"
00:10:52.320,00:10:53.230,皇上以后少不得,,,
00:10:53.560,00:10:54.750,要在她身上分心了,00:10:52.400,00:10:54.800,His Majesty will pay more attention to her.
00:10:55.480,00:10:56.550,妹妹你得了空,,,
00:10:56.880,00:10:58.830,可要好好调理自己的身子,00:10:54.900,00:10:59.560,"You will have more time to yourself, and
should improve your reproductive health."
00:11:00.040,00:11:01.470,富察贵人怀有龙种,00:11:00.200,00:11:02.200,Lady Fuca bears His Majesty's child.
00:11:01.920,00:11:03.590,皇上关怀也是情理中事,00:11:02.200,00:11:04.420,Naturally he will spend more time with her.
00:11:04.840,00:11:06.670,妹妹有空自会调理身子,00:11:05.080,00:11:07.920,Thank you for caring about my health.
00:11:07.640,00:11:08.790,姐姐也要好好调理,,,
00:11:09.080,00:11:10.350,温宜公主的身子才是,00:11:07.960,00:11:10.740,But surely Princess Wenyi's health is your top priority.
00:11:11.040,00:11:12.310,公主千金之体,,,
00:11:12.720,00:11:13.990,万不可有什么闪失,00:11:11.260,00:11:14.440,"The princess is more precious than gold.
No harm must come to her."
00:11:15.560,00:11:17.190,是莞贵人,00:11:15.740,00:11:17.980,Thank you.
00:11:22.800,00:11:24.830,曹贵人言语冒犯娘娘,00:11:22.840,00:11:25.180,Noble Lady Cao has verbally offended Your Highness.
00:11:25.160,00:11:26.750,嫔妾替姐姐向娘娘请罪,00:11:25.180,00:11:28.340,I entreat Your Highness's forgiveness for her.
00:11:27.040,00:11:28.110,望娘娘恕罪,,,
00:11:29.640,00:11:30.270,什么呀,00:11:29.800,00:11:31.540,What?
00:11:32.120,00:11:33.270,曹贵人适才说,,,
00:11:33.800,00:11:35.910,嫔妾所承雨露最多却无身孕,00:11:32.360,00:11:36.480,"Lady Cao just said that I am most frequently visited
by His Majesty but not pregnant."
00:11:36.600,00:11:38.710,这话不是借着妹妹的事,00:11:36.600,00:11:40.300,Her words of mockery also apply to Your Highness.
00:11:39.000,00:11:39.870,来讥讽娘娘吗,,,
00:11:40.640,00:11:42.230,嫔妾之中究竟还是娘娘,,,
00:11:42.640,00:11:43.590,所承雨露最多,00:11:40.800,00:11:44.300,"Of all His Majesty's concubines,
Your Highness has been visited the most."
00:11:44.280,00:11:46.230,嫔妾替姐姐向娘娘请罪,00:11:44.300,00:11:47.620,Hence I beg Your Highness's pardon on Cao's behalf.
00:11:48.840,00:11:52.350,有孕又如何 无孕又如何,00:11:49.080,00:11:52.140,What is the big deal about being pregnant?
00:11:53.480,00:11:54.070,娘娘,00:11:53.740,00:11:55.280,Your Highness...
00:11:56.800,00:11:59.870,天命若顾我 必将赐我一子,00:11:56.920,00:12:00.080,I will have a son if Heaven blesses me.
00:12:00.640,00:12:03.950,若天命不眷顾 也不过是个女儿,00:12:00.660,00:12:04.580,"If not, I will have a daughter."
00:12:06.280,00:12:08.030,聊胜于无而已,00:12:06.400,00:12:08.660,It's better than not having any.
00:12:08.680,00:12:10.910,娘娘说得有理 有无子息,00:12:08.920,00:12:10.200,I agree with Your Highness.
00:12:11.280,00:12:13.670,得宠终归得宠 就算母凭子贵,00:12:10.300,00:12:12.760,His Majesty's favor is not dependent on bearing a heir.
,,,00:12:12.760,00:12:14.960,The belief that a concubine can gain favor by having a child
00:12:14.080,00:12:16.310,也要看这孩子合不合皇上的心意,00:12:14.960,00:12:17.000,is only true if His Majesty cares about the child.
00:12:19.520,00:12:20.790,恭送华妃娘娘,00:12:19.640,00:12:22.600,I bid Your Highness goodbye.
00:12:31.080,00:12:33.870,小主夜深了早些睡吧,00:12:30.880,00:12:33.200,"You are still awake, My Lady."
,,,00:12:33.200,00:12:35.220,It's late. You should rest.
00:12:37.840,00:12:41.430,富察贵人不过几次就有了身孕,00:12:37.800,00:12:42.320,Lady Fuca got pregnant easily after few times of service.
00:12:42.680,00:12:45.350,而我却一点动静都没有,00:12:42.920,00:12:43.920,But I ...
,,,00:12:44.200,00:12:45.920,haven't have any luck.
00:12:47.280,00:12:50.190,不得不说是福薄命舛,00:12:47.520,00:12:50.780,I have to say I'm not as blessed as her.
,,,00:12:51.420,00:12:52.840,How come?
00:12:50.880,00:12:54.830,怎么会呢 小主是福泽深厚的人,00:12:52.880,00:12:55.300,"My Lady, you have Heaven's great blessing."
00:12:55.320,00:12:56.950,那有喜是迟早的事情,00:12:55.480,00:12:57.520,Having good news is just a matter of time.
00:12:57.680,00:12:59.430,小主不必操之过急了,00:12:57.820,00:13:00.380,All you need to do is wait patiently.
00:13:00.760,00:13:04.030,倒是我听守城侍卫说,00:13:01.060,00:13:06.800,"Today, the palace guards told me that
there is a plague spreading in the city."
00:13:04.560,00:13:06.670,现如今京城里时疫泛滥,,,
00:13:07.240,00:13:08.870,很难说不会传到宫中,00:13:07.360,00:13:09.940,It's possible that it will affect the palace.
00:13:10.440,00:13:12.270,小主要万万小心才是啊,00:13:10.700,00:13:12.920,"You must take extra caution, My Lady."
00:13:15.240,00:13:16.030,快睡吧,00:13:15.300,00:13:17.220,Have a good rest.
00:13:20.040,00:13:21.230,富察贵人有孕,,,
00:13:21.800,00:13:22.750,本宫好心让颂芝,00:13:20.360,00:13:24.600,I asked Songzhi to send some mountain yam cakes to Lady Fuca.
00:13:23.080,00:13:24.630,送了一盘红枣山药糕去,,,
00:13:25.040,00:13:26.630,谁知富察贵人仗着有孕,00:13:24.940,00:13:28.160,But she said she was pregnant and couldn't stand up to thank me.
00:13:27.040,00:13:29.550,也不起身谢恩真是大胆,00:13:28.560,00:13:29.880,How dare she!
00:13:30.160,00:13:31.670,富察贵人只是一时放肆,,,
00:13:31.960,00:13:32.750,才这样罢了,00:13:30.600,00:13:35.020,"Lady Fuca was brash, but it doesn't mean
she disrespects Your Highness."
00:13:33.160,00:13:34.830,并非真的对娘娘不敬,,,
00:13:35.240,00:13:37.190,她刚怀孕就放肆成这个样子,00:13:35.500,00:13:37.840,She became so full of herself right after she conceived!
00:13:38.000,00:13:39.550,若是来日诞下皇子,,,
00:13:40.040,00:13:41.190,岂不是要上天了吗,00:13:38.160,00:13:41.780,When she gives birth her arrogance over her increased status will be sky-high!
00:13:42.320,00:13:45.230,那倒也未必 只看齐妃便知道了,00:13:42.520,00:13:45.560,Not necessarily. Concort Astuce [Third Prince's mother] is an example.
00:13:45.960,00:13:47.670,富察贵人年轻美貌,,,
00:13:48.640,00:13:51.950,天长日久难免皇上会动心,00:13:46.080,00:13:52.040,"Lady Fuca is young and pretty. Her favor from
His Majesty will outlast the older concubines."
00:13:53.000,00:13:53.790,是啊,00:13:53.240,00:13:54.540,Indeed.
00:13:54.720,00:13:56.670,若诞下的是个公主倒也罢了,00:13:54.960,00:13:57.440,It won't be too much of a concern if she has a princess.
00:13:57.520,00:13:59.070,要诞下的是位皇子,00:13:57.720,00:13:59.740,But if she gives birth to a prince ...
00:13:59.760,00:14:01.430,宫中许久没有皇子诞生,00:13:59.920,00:14:02.240,It's been a long time since the last prince was born ...
00:14:02.040,00:14:04.190,皇上不知会高兴成怎样呢,00:14:02.280,00:14:04.200,His Majesty would rejoice greatly ...
00:14:04.440,00:14:05.630,本宫记得皇上这个月,,,
00:14:06.000,00:14:07.270,就去了你那儿一次,00:14:04.440,00:14:07.960,I recall His Majesty only visited you one time this month.
00:14:08.440,00:14:10.030,现在富察贵人有孕,00:14:08.700,00:14:10.820,"Now that Lady Fuca is pregnant,"
00:14:10.840,00:14:12.270,恐怕连一次都没了,00:14:10.820,00:14:12.660,I'm afraid you'll go from one to zero.
00:14:13.800,00:14:15.710,嫔妾只愿温宜平安成长,00:14:14.080,00:14:17.740,I only wish for Wenyi to have good health and a peaceful life.
00:14:16.160,00:14:16.910,别无他求,,,
00:14:17.920,00:14:20.670,你能容人 未必人能容你,00:14:18.140,00:14:21.660,"You can tolerate others, but they might not tolerate you."
00:14:21.880,00:14:22.870,好在富察贵人,,,
00:14:23.160,00:14:24.910,也不是一个有福的坯子,00:14:22.160,00:14:25.500,"Fortunately, Lady Fuca is not the blessed kind."
00:14:25.600,00:14:26.350,这才刚怀孕,,,
00:14:26.680,00:14:28.030,宫外就闹起了时疫,00:14:25.840,00:14:28.400,A plague broke out in the city when she got pregnant.
00:14:28.480,00:14:30.150,搞得皇上是满心烦恼,00:14:28.700,00:14:31.040,His Majesty is very concerned about it.
00:14:31.640,00:14:34.070,娘娘出事了 宫里出时疫了,00:14:31.940,00:14:34.940,"Your Highness, the plague has reached the palace."
00:14:35.080,00:14:35.830,什么,00:14:35.300,00:14:37.020,What?
00:14:43.240,00:14:45.470,艾叶已经分到后宫各处了吗,00:14:43.200,00:14:46.260,Have you distributed dried mugwort to each palace?
00:14:46.320,00:14:47.430,已经连夜分发了,00:14:46.540,00:14:48.720,"Yes, Your Majesty. We did it overnight."
00:14:48.960,00:14:50.270,富察贵人有孕,00:14:49.180,00:14:50.940,Lady Fuca is pregnant.
00:14:50.600,00:14:52.150,她宫里要多放一些,00:14:50.940,00:14:52.940,Send extra to her palace.
00:14:53.320,00:14:55.910,华妃的翊坤宫先闹出时疫,00:14:53.520,00:14:56.540,"The Palace of Earthly Honor was the first
to report a carrier of the plague."
00:14:56.440,00:14:58.430,所以更要严加清扫,00:14:56.540,00:14:58.580,Her palace must be completely cleansed.
00:14:58.680,00:15:02.070,每日晨起正午黄昏,00:14:58.580,00:15:02.300,Burn mugwort leaves in her palace to dispel the disease
00:15:02.560,00:15:04.230,各烧一次艾叶驱疫,00:15:02.300,00:15:05.000,"every dawn, noon, and dusk."
00:15:05.160,00:15:07.430,还有再吩咐太医院,00:15:05.420,00:15:09.300,"In addition, the Imperial Infirmary must prepare medicinal herbs"
00:15:07.760,00:15:09.270,配好驱疫的药材,,,
00:15:09.800,00:15:12.790,让各宫的宫女连夜缝制出香包,00:15:09.380,00:15:12.380,for the maids in every palace to make sachets tonight.
00:15:13.120,00:15:15.390,挂在身上和室内,00:15:12.380,00:15:15.020,Everyone needs to wear the sachets and put them in their rooms.
00:15:16.280,00:15:17.030,章太医,00:15:15.260,00:15:16.440,Yes.
00:15:17.200,00:15:17.790,在,00:15:16.560,00:15:17.940,"- Dr Zhang.
- Yes."
00:15:18.080,00:15:19.430,你是太医院之首,00:15:18.060,00:15:20.240,You are the head of the Imperial Infirmary.
00:15:20.160,00:15:23.190,依你看这时疫到底是怎么回事,00:15:20.240,00:15:23.540,What's your understanding of the plague?
00:15:23.560,00:15:26.030,此症乃不正之气所致,00:15:23.720,00:15:26.540,This disease is caused by an external pathogen.
00:15:26.480,00:15:28.710,开始是发烧头疼,00:15:26.540,00:15:29.240,"It starts with a fever and headache,"
00:15:29.240,00:15:31.510,接而呢是发疫闭塞,00:15:29.240,00:15:31.920,and then progresses into severe blood stasis.
00:15:31.960,00:15:33.670,一人有病染及一室,00:15:32.120,00:15:33.980,"One sick person will infect the entire chamber,"
00:15:33.960,00:15:35.550,一室有病染及一宫,00:15:33.980,00:15:35.900,"and one chamber, the entire palace."
00:15:35.880,00:15:39.470,还是及早防范 免得要出大事啊,00:15:36.000,00:15:39.960,"It is better to take preventive measures
as early as possible before it becomes prevalent."
00:15:39.960,00:15:41.150,有这么厉害,00:15:40.120,00:15:41.900,Is it that serious?
00:15:41.840,00:15:43.670,微臣不敢夸大其词,00:15:41.900,00:15:44.260,I dare not make an overstatement before Your Majesty.
00:15:44.360,00:15:46.910,后宫杂役已有人染上此症,00:15:44.580,00:15:47.380,A servant in the harem has already contracted the plague.
00:15:47.320,00:15:48.910,可见来势之凶猛,00:15:47.380,00:15:49.500,It's coming aggressively from the city!
00:15:49.520,00:15:51.630,太医院会有及早防范,00:15:49.640,00:15:52.100,The Imperial Infirmary will take early precautions.
00:15:52.320,00:15:54.750,还请皇后娘娘晓谕各宫,00:15:52.560,00:15:57.160,"I request Your Majesty to inform the harem
to avoid making unnecessary trips and visits."
00:15:55.120,00:15:56.550,不要轻易走动啊,,,
00:15:57.880,00:16:00.710,宫中闻得有时疫已是人人自危,00:15:58.000,00:16:01.320,"The palace is already in panic after
hearing about the presence of the plague."
00:16:01.160,00:16:03.590,太医所言必当人人谨遵,00:16:01.420,00:16:04.300,"They will strictly obey your instructions, Dr Zhang."
00:16:04.520,00:16:06.710,一切就有劳太医院了,00:16:04.780,00:16:07.700,I trust the Imperial Infirmary will work hard on it.
00:16:07.800,00:16:08.470,是,00:16:08.040,00:16:09.540,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:16:09.680,00:16:11.630,启禀娘娘 咱们宫里做杂役的,00:16:10.220,00:16:13.140,"Your Highness, the servant Xiao-Dezi
in our palace contracted the plague."
00:16:12.000,00:16:12.830,小德子得了时疫,,,
00:16:13.080,00:16:14.950,内务府的人正要把他挪出去呢,00:16:13.140,00:16:16.180,The Household Department is going to move him out.
00:16:16.720,00:16:19.270,那还不赶紧的 把他用过的东西,00:16:16.800,00:16:18.500,Immediately!
00:16:19.680,00:16:20.750,穿过的衣服全烧掉,00:16:18.500,00:16:21.300,Burn everything he has used and worn.
00:16:21.320,00:16:22.830,他用过的杯子茶具,00:16:21.580,00:16:24.300,Smash his pots and cups.
00:16:23.320,00:16:24.230,也拿出去砸碎,,,
00:16:24.800,00:16:26.630,在他屋里撒满石灰 去去晦气,00:16:24.800,00:16:26.940,Scatter lime in his room to dispel bad fortune.
00:16:27.120,00:16:28.070,娘娘不必惊慌,,,
00:16:28.360,00:16:30.270,奴才已经吩咐下边人去做了,00:16:27.140,00:16:30.400,"Your Highness need not worry.
I have already told the servants to do it."
00:16:30.720,00:16:32.030,这么大的事能不慌吗,00:16:30.780,00:16:32.980,How can I not worry?
00:16:37.280,00:16:39.150,华妃娘娘吉祥,00:16:37.600,00:16:40.100,Peace to Your Highness.
00:16:45.240,00:16:47.790,启禀娘娘 皇后娘娘说,00:16:45.160,00:16:47.960,"Your Highness, Her Majesty said that"
00:16:48.040,00:16:49.790,最近宫中时疫盛行,00:16:47.960,00:16:50.200,"the plague has emerged in the palace,"
00:16:50.160,00:16:51.590,请娘娘帮着照应,00:16:50.200,00:16:51.740,which requires Your Highness’s assistance.
00:16:51.880,00:16:54.070,东六宫已经洒了煮沸的烧酒,00:16:51.780,00:16:54.260,Boiling liquor [a disinfectant] has been doused in the Eastern Six Palaces.
00:16:54.400,00:16:55.590,正在焚烧艾叶,00:16:54.260,00:16:56.040,And mugwort leaves are being burned.
00:16:55.840,00:16:58.190,西六宫就交娘娘主理,00:16:56.040,00:16:58.680,The Western six palaces are entrusted to Your Highness.
00:16:59.400,00:17:00.270,知道了,00:16:59.520,00:17:01.060,All right.
00:17:01.280,00:17:04.350,皇后娘娘还说咸福宫虽然人少,00:17:01.400,00:17:04.600,"Her Majesty also mentioned that although the
Palace of Universal Happiness has fewer occupants,"
00:17:04.720,00:17:06.470,但沈答应所住的存菊堂,00:17:04.860,00:17:08.240,"Companion Shen’s Chamber of Chrysanthemums
must be opened to burn mugwort leaves."
00:17:06.800,00:17:08.230,也要打开焚烧艾叶,,,
00:17:08.480,00:17:10.910,六宫之中不能有一处遗漏,00:17:08.420,00:17:11.480,Not a palace in the harem should be overlooked.
00:17:12.000,00:17:15.470,回禀皇后娘娘 本宫会做好的,00:17:12.260,00:17:16.040,Tell Her Majesty I will do it properly.
00:17:16.520,00:17:17.390,奴才告退,00:17:16.740,00:17:18.580,Allow me to take my leave
00:17:24.920,00:17:26.070,刘畚没有抓住,00:17:25.060,00:17:26.540,Liu Ben escaped.
00:17:26.760,00:17:28.630,始终是本宫的心腹大患,00:17:26.760,00:17:28.820,Shen still remains a menace to me.
00:17:29.720,00:17:31.190,可若是沈答应死了,00:17:29.900,00:17:31.640,But if Companion Shen is dead ...
00:17:31.600,00:17:32.750,即使抓住了刘备,,,
00:17:33.080,00:17:34.190,那也是死无对证,00:17:31.780,00:17:34.300,the dead tell no tales even if Liu Ben is caught.
00:17:34.520,00:17:36.550,当初没能治沈眉庄的死罪,00:17:34.620,00:17:37.100,We failed in getting Shen Meizhuang the death penalty.
00:17:37.600,00:17:38.590,真是便宜她了,00:17:37.680,00:17:39.320,She got very lucky.
00:17:40.240,00:17:42.870,如今就让她自生自灭好了,00:17:40.220,00:17:43.460,Now we shall let her perish.
00:17:45.040,00:17:46.190,不知那小德子屋中,,,
00:17:46.440,00:17:47.830,还有什么物件可用吗,00:17:45.120,00:17:48.000,Is there any thing in Xiao-Dezi’s room of use to us?
00:17:49.120,00:17:50.790,还有小德子得时疫后,00:17:48.260,00:17:49.360,Err ...
00:17:51.200,00:17:51.950,用的一套茶具,00:17:49.360,00:17:52.420,There is a tea set that he has been using.
00:17:52.640,00:17:54.790,如果谁不小心用它喝了茶,,,
00:17:55.640,00:17:58.070,那肯定会染上时疫的,00:17:52.940,00:17:58.180,"If it was unknowingly used for tea,
the person would definitely be infected."
00:17:58.920,00:18:02.390,这么好的东西砸碎了多可惜呀,00:17:58.680,00:18:02.820,It’s a waste to smash a nice tea set.
00:18:03.600,00:18:04.950,送去存菊堂吧,00:18:03.920,00:18:06.340,Send it to the Chamber of Chrysanthemums.
00:18:06.480,00:18:07.150,奴才明白,00:18:06.660,00:18:08.440,Understood.
00:18:15.520,00:18:16.750,皇上心系小主,00:18:15.720,00:18:17.360,"His Majesty cares for you, My Lady,"
00:18:17.000,00:18:19.030,特命奴才来清理存菊堂,00:18:17.360,00:18:19.340,and ordered us to clean up your chamber.
00:18:19.400,00:18:21.030,使小主勿要染上时疫,00:18:19.500,00:18:21.960,"We hope to protect you from the plague, My Lady."
00:18:22.240,00:18:25.070,若有打扰之处 还请小主见谅,00:18:22.520,00:18:25.020,I seek your forgiveness for any inconveniences.

00:18:28.280,00:18:29.110,何来打扰,00:18:28.540,00:18:29.840,There is no inconvenience.
00:18:29.600,00:18:33.310,奴才明白 去外面洒些烧酒,00:18:29.900,00:18:31.340,"Yes, My Lady."

00:18:34.840,00:18:35.390,进来,00:18:35.120,00:18:36.580,Come in.
00:18:42.880,00:18:44.310,小主禁足这么久,,,
00:18:44.720,00:18:46.390,想必东西都已经旧了,00:18:43.060,00:18:47.180,"My Lady, the Household Department sends you a new tea set"
00:18:47.320,00:18:48.350,内务府特命奴才,,,
00:18:48.720,00:18:50.070,给您送套新的茶具过来,00:18:47.460,00:18:50.580,since your utensils are not in good condition.
00:18:51.120,00:18:53.110,茶都沏好了 请小主品尝,00:18:51.060,00:18:53.440,"The tea has been made for you, My Lady."
00:18:53.920,00:18:54.710,有心了,00:18:53.940,00:18:55.740,Thank you.
00:18:56.600,00:18:58.390,小主 外面都已经,00:18:56.520,00:18:57.860,"My Lady,"
00:18:58.760,00:18:59.670,收拾得差不多了,00:18:57.860,00:19:00.020,We have almost finished the work outside.
00:19:00.080,00:19:01.390,您要是没有别的吩咐,,,
00:19:01.920,00:19:03.470,那奴才还得到别的宫里去,00:19:00.020,00:19:03.520,I have to go to the other palaces if you allow me.
00:19:06.160,00:19:07.830,奴才告退了,00:19:06.400,00:19:08.800,"I bid you goodbye, My Lady."
00:19:09.480,00:19:10.870,前些日子你一直咳嗽,00:19:10.040,00:19:11.980,You have been coughing lately.
00:19:11.360,00:19:12.550,一定要格外注意保养,00:19:11.980,00:19:14.020,Make sure you take extra care of yourself.
00:19:14.080,00:19:15.150,多谢姐姐关怀,00:19:14.180,00:19:15.980,Thank you.
00:19:16.560,00:19:17.750,有劳小主关心,00:19:16.760,00:19:18.500,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:19:18.280,00:19:20.230,我们按照规定一日三遍地,00:19:18.500,00:19:22.060,We are burning mugwort leaves three times a day as required.
00:19:20.600,00:19:21.470,焚烧艾叶了,,,
00:19:23.240,00:19:25.710,太医院送了一些药香囊来,00:19:23.480,00:19:26.320,The Imperial Infirmary sent some medical sachets .
00:19:26.280,00:19:29.230,我想着你身子弱 就多拿了些来,00:19:26.320,00:19:30.660,I took some more for you since you've been feeling unwell.
00:19:29.640,00:19:30.390,给你防身用,,,
00:19:32.680,00:19:34.430,碎玉轩有姐姐和淳常在,,,
00:19:34.960,00:19:36.550,自然是什么好的东西都有,00:19:32.920,00:19:37.120,"The Palace of Pearl Jade is well provided for
since you and Attendant Chun live there."
00:19:37.240,00:19:38.350,这些都是什么呀,00:19:37.480,00:19:38.720,What are these ?
00:19:38.680,00:19:39.510,太医院说这些是,,,
00:19:39.840,00:19:41.110,新送来的一些苍术,00:19:38.740,00:19:43.120,"The Imperial Infirmary sent some Bai Zhu root
to be burned with the mugwort."
00:19:41.400,00:19:43.110,和艾叶一起烧了会更好,,,
00:19:43.400,00:19:44.390,这是给延禧宫的,00:19:43.500,00:19:45.080,This basket is for the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:19:45.640,00:19:46.790,都送到我那儿去吧,00:19:45.080,00:19:47.660,"Oh, put them all in my chamber."
00:19:48.000,00:19:49.470,这不是给我们延禧宫的吗,00:19:47.880,00:19:49.940,This is for everyone in the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:19:49.760,00:19:51.470,怎么我们家小主一样都没有呢,00:19:49.940,00:19:52.120,Why didn't Attendant An receive any?
00:19:53.400,00:19:54.350,富察贵人恕罪,00:19:53.500,00:19:54.980,"I beg your pardon, Lady Fuca."
00:19:54.720,00:19:55.790,东西都去您那儿了,,,
00:19:56.120,00:19:57.230,那我们小主怎么办啊,00:19:54.980,00:19:57.580,You must give some to Attendant An.
00:19:57.680,00:19:59.350,安常在身强体健,00:19:57.900,00:20:01.100,"Attendant An is strong and healthy.
She doesn't need this."
00:19:59.640,00:20:01.070,自然不需要这些,,,
00:20:01.480,00:20:02.470,我怀着龙裔,,,
00:20:02.760,00:20:04.710,自然是要谨慎当心些,00:20:01.480,00:20:04.900,"I am with His Majesty's child.
I need to be treated with more care."
00:20:05.040,00:20:07.070,等哪日安常在也有孕了,00:20:05.220,00:20:09.120,I will surely give priority to Attendant An when she is pregnant.
00:20:07.640,00:20:09.150,我必然先让着她,,,
00:20:09.840,00:20:11.950,富察贵人与皇嗣的性命是性命,00:20:10.080,00:20:12.400,"Lady Fuca, you and your child's health matter."
00:20:12.280,00:20:13.630,安常在的性命也是性命,00:20:12.400,00:20:14.080,So does Attendant An's.
00:20:14.320,00:20:16.550,这些苍术太医院并非不再送了,00:20:14.480,00:20:17.180,The Imperial Infirmary will keep sending the herbs.
00:20:17.000,00:20:18.790,富察贵人为何要一人独占,00:20:17.340,00:20:20.040,Why would you have all of them to yourself?
00:20:19.080,00:20:19.910,而不顾他人呢,,,
00:20:20.480,00:20:21.750,我当是谁呢,,,
00:20:22.000,00:20:23.870,原来是莞贵人大驾光临啊,00:20:20.680,00:20:24.020,"Ah I see, in the presence of Lady Sourire,"
00:20:24.400,00:20:27.910,难怪啊 安常在都敢来争东西了,00:20:24.260,00:20:27.920,Attendant An finds the courage to argue for things.
00:20:29.640,00:20:31.710,姐姐误会 妹妹不敢,00:20:29.860,00:20:32.360,"Fuca, you misunderstood. I didn't intend to."
00:20:32.360,00:20:33.430,安常在好性子,00:20:32.560,00:20:34.180,Attendant An has a good temper.
00:20:33.920,00:20:35.830,可我却不得不多说一句,00:20:34.180,00:20:36.180,But I have to say this for her.
00:20:36.200,00:20:38.430,今日不管怎样都不由你说了算,00:20:36.400,00:20:38.960,What happens in my palace is what I say.
00:20:39.000,00:20:41.310,你若不服气 大可以告诉皇上去,00:20:39.180,00:20:41.840,You are welcome to tell His Majesty if you disagree.
00:20:42.240,00:20:43.230,皇嗣为重,,,
00:20:43.720,00:20:45.790,想必皇上也不会帮你的,00:20:42.420,00:20:46.420,I believe His Majesty will give priority to an imperial heir.
00:20:46.600,00:20:47.950,其实何必惊扰皇上呢,,,
00:20:48.360,00:20:50.630,这个道理贵人自己也能想明白,00:20:46.880,00:20:50.820,You don't need to involve His Majesty to make sense of this.
00:20:51.840,00:20:54.350,若这些苍术只用在贵人一人宫里,00:20:52.100,00:20:54.900,"If you use all the Bai Zhu root,"
00:20:55.120,00:20:56.870,万一安常在得上了时疫,,,
00:20:57.280,00:20:59.110,那贵人岂不更深陷险境,00:20:55.100,00:20:59.500,"and Attendant An then contracts the disease, won't your own palace be at more risk?"
00:20:59.600,00:21:00.910,你这样不就是咒我了吗,00:20:59.780,00:21:01.460,Are you cursing me ?
00:21:01.640,00:21:03.310,仔细我告诉皇上去,00:21:01.800,00:21:04.080,You will be in trouble when I tell His Majesty.
00:21:04.280,00:21:06.430,是否告诉皇上 贵人自己定夺,00:21:04.360,00:21:07.020,It's up to you whether you should tell His Majesty.
00:21:07.400,00:21:09.070,只怕皇上早闻这些事后,,,
00:21:09.600,00:21:11.910,也会觉得贵人您不顾大局,00:21:07.560,00:21:12.120,"I'm afraid His Majesty will agree that
you are not thinking of the greater good."
00:21:12.480,00:21:13.750,我偏偏不听你的,00:21:12.620,00:21:14.300,I'm not going to listen to you.
00:21:14.320,00:21:16.590,搬进去关上门,00:21:14.400,00:21:15.200,Move them in.
,,,00:21:15.800,00:21:16.600,And shut the door
00:21:22.400,00:21:23.710,姐姐辩了也是无用,,,
00:21:24.120,00:21:25.310,反倒惹一身是非,00:21:22.560,00:21:25.460,"Sourire, don't waste your breath and cause yourself trouble."
00:21:25.600,00:21:27.710,我知道无用 只是不说给她听,00:21:25.600,00:21:27.040,I know it was pointless.
00:21:28.240,00:21:30.110,她今日夺一次 明日还有第二次,00:21:27.040,00:21:30.360,"But if I don't speak up for you,
she will do this time after time."
00:21:30.720,00:21:32.870,那安妹妹岂不日日都要受她委屈,00:21:30.880,00:21:33.800,That will upset you again and again.
00:21:34.360,00:21:35.310,我们先进去吧,00:21:34.180,00:21:35.200,Let's go back to the room.
00:21:35.840,00:21:37.310,待会儿我再去跟太医院,00:21:36.300,00:21:38.460,I will ask the Imperial Infirmary for some Bai Zhu.
00:21:37.680,00:21:38.510,要一些苍术去,,,
00:21:38.840,00:21:39.630,哪儿那么容易,00:21:38.780,00:21:40.560,It is not that easy.
00:21:40.360,00:21:41.670,要这么容易得的东西,,,
00:21:42.120,00:21:43.030,我也不和她争辩了,00:21:40.560,00:21:43.640,I would not contend with her if it was easily available.
00:21:45.200,00:21:45.910,走吧,00:21:45.260,00:21:46.960,Let's go.

00:22:06.440,00:22:07.510,这病来势汹汹,00:22:06.600,00:22:08.520,The plague is spreading ferociously.
00:22:08.640,00:22:10.270,连太医院也束手无策,00:22:08.840,00:22:11.260,Even the Imperial Infirmary hasn't a clue what to do.
00:22:11.040,00:22:13.030,太后皇后还有齐妃华妃,00:22:11.260,00:22:13.480,"His Majesty, Her Majesty, Consort Fleur, and Consort Astuce,"
00:22:13.320,00:22:15.390,已经在宝华殿焚香祷告了两天了,00:22:13.480,00:22:16.040,have been praying for two days in the Baohua Hall.
00:22:17.480,00:22:18.950,京城内外时疫遍布,00:22:17.740,00:22:19.780,The plague has spread all over the city.
00:22:19.960,00:22:21.950,太医院的救治也是杯水车薪,00:22:20.180,00:22:22.720,"The imperial doctors are ""a cup of water on a burning carriage""."
00:22:22.480,00:22:24.710,皇上都急了好几日了 人都瘦了,00:22:22.720,00:22:25.800,His Majesty has lost weight after a few days of anxiety.
00:22:27.800,00:22:28.870,这味道太呛了,00:22:27.840,00:22:30.040,Such a pungent smell.
00:22:29.480,00:22:32.030,是啊 这几日宫女们,,,
00:22:32.520,00:22:35.070,也是拿了食醋放在各处煮沸驱疫,00:22:30.180,00:22:35.100,"It is. The maids have been boiling
vinegar to prevent the spread of the plague."
00:22:35.680,00:22:36.830,醋味也是呛人,00:22:35.860,00:22:37.700,It makes the palace smell unpleasant.
00:22:37.840,00:22:39.550,那个闻着闻着倒也惯了,00:22:37.800,00:22:40.900,I have got used to the smell.
00:22:44.560,00:22:46.030,小主小主不好了,00:22:44.420,00:22:45.980,"My Lady, terrible news!"
00:22:46.520,00:22:48.390,有话慢慢说 小心撞了小主,00:22:46.460,00:22:48.660,Inform My Lady calmly.
00:22:49.400,00:22:50.430,咸福宫传来消息,,,
00:22:50.760,00:22:51.830,说眉庄小主染上时疫了,00:22:49.220,00:22:52.320,"The Palace of Universal Happiness reported that
Lady Meizhuang contracted the plague."
00:22:54.640,00:22:55.990,小主你去不得,00:22:54.260,00:22:56.920,"My Lady, don't go!"
00:22:58.320,00:22:59.150,怎么会这样,00:22:58.480,00:22:59.820,How did this happen?
00:22:59.520,00:23:00.670,别急妹妹先坐下,,,
00:23:00.920,00:23:01.870,我慢慢地跟你说啊,00:22:59.940,00:23:02.640,"Take it easy, Sourire. Have a seat."
00:23:05.840,00:23:06.790,是这样的,,,
00:23:07.200,00:23:08.950,这人她昨天还好好的,00:23:06.240,00:23:09.000,She was all right yesterday.
00:23:09.720,00:23:11.510,今天早上起来芳若来报,,,
00:23:11.840,00:23:13.590,说她把吃的东西都吐了出来,00:23:10.060,00:23:13.820,"But this morning, Orchid reported that
she vomited all that she ate"
00:23:13.920,00:23:15.270,人也开始烧得厉害,00:23:14.020,00:23:15.740,and developed a high fever.
00:23:15.760,00:23:18.030,到了午间就开始说胡话了,00:23:15.940,00:23:18.200,And she began to talk deliriously since noon.
00:23:18.440,00:23:20.430,那太医呢去请了太医没有,00:23:18.540,00:23:20.980,What about the imperial doctors? Did they come?
00:23:20.960,00:23:21.990,别提太医了,00:23:21.100,00:23:22.540,Forget about the doctors.
00:23:22.360,00:23:24.590,沈答应禁足良久 又受尽冷落,00:23:22.540,00:23:24.820,Companion Shen has long been neglected in her confinement.
00:23:24.920,00:23:26.350,现在时疫又易传染,00:23:24.820,00:23:26.640,The plague is very contagious.
00:23:26.720,00:23:27.710,哪个太医敢过来,00:23:26.640,00:23:28.160,Who dares to go?
00:23:28.480,00:23:30.110,我已经派人去请了三四趟了,00:23:28.600,00:23:30.460,I've sent for doctors a few times.
00:23:30.600,00:23:32.310,竟没有一个人敢过来看的,00:23:30.680,00:23:32.500,But no one visited.
00:23:33.240,00:23:35.190,你说说这让人怎么好啊,00:23:33.320,00:23:35.680,"Sourire, what should we do?"
00:23:36.040,00:23:38.950,奴婢已经尽力了 本想去求皇上,00:23:35.880,00:23:37.580,I've tried my best.
00:23:39.480,00:23:41.990,可是皇上在前朝议政 谁都不见,00:23:37.840,00:23:42.260,"I wanted to ask His Majesty for help,
but he has been at court all morning."
00:23:42.400,00:23:44.350,太后皇后和几位娘娘,00:23:42.560,00:23:44.580,"The Empress Dowager, the Empress, and the consorts"
00:23:44.720,00:23:46.030,都在宝华殿祈福,00:23:44.700,00:23:46.320,are all praying in the Baohua Hall.
00:23:46.720,00:23:48.830,连个能拿主意的人都没有啊,00:23:46.800,00:23:49.480,There's no one who can order the doctors to come.
00:23:52.960,00:23:53.550,我去瞧瞧,00:23:52.840,00:23:54.380,I will go see her.
00:23:54.800,00:23:56.670,小主你可去不得呀去不得,00:23:54.700,00:23:56.920,"- You mustn't go, My Lady.
- Don't go, My Lady."
00:23:56.920,00:23:59.470,妹妹 现在存菊堂你进去危险啊,00:23:56.920,00:23:59.580,"Sourire, it's dangerous to go into her chamber."
00:24:00.040,00:24:01.230,时疫容易传染,00:24:00.120,00:24:02.020,The disease is infectious.
00:24:01.760,00:24:03.710,无论什么情形总要看了再说,00:24:02.020,00:24:04.380,I can't decide for her before I see her.
00:24:04.040,00:24:05.070,妹妹使不得,00:24:04.860,00:24:05.940,My Lady...
00:24:05.280,00:24:07.350,小主 小主 小主,00:24:06.240,00:24:07.680,My Lady!
00:24:07.720,00:24:10.430,小主心系眉庄小主,00:24:08.440,00:24:10.920,"My Lady, I know you are worried about Lady Meizhuang."
00:24:10.880,00:24:12.150,也要保全自己才是啊,00:24:10.960,00:24:12.680,But you must also care for yourself.
00:24:12.320,00:24:12.990,是啊,00:24:12.680,00:24:13.420,Exactly.
00:24:13.360,00:24:14.670,隔着门望一眼就是了,00:24:13.500,00:24:15.080,You should just look from behind the door.
00:24:15.040,00:24:16.670,我就进去看一眼 一眼就好,00:24:15.080,00:24:16.780,I'm going in for one glance. Just one quick look.
00:24:17.040,00:24:17.830,小主使不得,00:24:16.780,00:24:18.360,"My Lady, don't."
00:24:18.240,00:24:19.710,眉庄小主已经这样了,00:24:18.380,00:24:20.260,Lady Meizhuang is already infected.
00:24:20.120,00:24:21.390,小主更要保全自己呀,00:24:20.260,00:24:21.580,You have to protect yourself.
00:24:21.680,00:24:22.310,我就瞧一眼,00:24:21.580,00:24:22.800,Just one glance.
00:24:22.520,00:24:23.590,要不然连个替眉庄小主,,,
00:24:24.080,00:24:25.190,说话的人都没有啊,00:24:22.800,00:24:25.880,"Otherwise there would be no one
to speak for Lady Meizhuang."
00:24:25.520,00:24:26.230,小主,,,
00:24:30.480,00:24:31.550,小主小主,,,
00:24:34.520,00:24:37.110,劳烦姑姑好好照顾眉姐姐,00:24:34.320,00:24:37.420,"Please look after her, Madam."
00:24:42.040,00:24:42.990,苏公公,00:24:42.040,00:24:43.220,Mr Su.
00:24:43.520,00:24:44.750,小主您别见怪啊,00:24:43.380,00:24:45.560,"I hope you can understand, My Lady."
00:24:45.840,00:24:47.270,民间流传着时疫,00:24:45.940,00:24:47.820,The plague is rampant in the city.
00:24:47.680,00:24:49.150,皇上为这事急得不行,,,
00:24:49.520,00:24:50.750,正和大臣们商议,00:24:47.840,00:24:51.040,His Majesty is anxious and discussing it with his ministers.
00:24:51.320,00:24:53.030,实在没空见小主啊,00:24:51.300,00:24:53.560,His Majesty can't spare a minute right now.
00:24:53.840,00:24:55.470,那皇上还要多久才能见我,00:24:53.700,00:24:56.060,How much longer will the discussions take?
00:24:56.320,00:24:58.950,事关重大 奴才也不敢胡乱揣测,00:24:56.120,00:24:59.300,It's a serious matter. I can't speculate on that.
00:24:59.600,00:25:00.630,小主要有急事,,,
00:25:01.000,00:25:02.190,不如先去求皇后吧,00:24:59.500,00:25:02.540,"If it is very urgent, My Lady,
you should go see the Empress first."
00:25:02.600,00:25:03.750,这正是为难的地方,00:25:02.780,00:25:04.200,I'm afraid I should not.
00:25:04.440,00:25:05.670,这件事情要求皇后,,,
00:25:06.120,00:25:07.510,也得皇上先答允了再说,00:25:04.280,00:25:07.500,I can't see Her Majesty without His Majesty's permission.
00:25:08.080,00:25:10.030,小主说的是沈答应的事,00:25:08.220,00:25:10.060,Is this about Companion Shen?
00:25:11.160,00:25:13.310,罢了罢了 小主,00:25:11.020,00:25:13.180,"You'd better not, My Lady."
00:25:13.680,00:25:15.070,奴才奉劝小主一句,00:25:13.360,00:25:15.560,"If you would listen to me, My Lady,"
00:25:15.720,00:25:17.150,皇上正为了时疫的事情,00:25:15.600,00:25:18.880,His Majesty has been distressed over the plague.
00:25:17.480,00:25:18.870,发愁上火呢,,,
00:25:19.160,00:25:21.070,小主何苦在这个节骨眼上,,,
00:25:21.360,00:25:23.350,提沈答应的事让皇上烦心呢,00:25:19.180,00:25:23.300,"You should not mention Companion Shen
and add to His Majesty's stress."
00:25:24.080,00:25:25.590,不如想想别的法子,00:25:24.180,00:25:25.900,You should consider other solutions.
00:25:26.480,00:25:29.550,多谢公公 若皇上得空,00:25:26.360,00:25:28.240,"Thank you, sir."
00:25:30.000,00:25:31.190,还烦请公公告知一声,00:25:28.640,00:25:31.480,But please inform His Majesty when you have a chance.
00:25:31.680,00:25:32.510,奴才知道,00:25:31.760,00:25:33.220,"Yes, My Lady."
00:25:49.520,00:25:51.710,微臣温实初给莞贵人请安,00:25:49.240,00:25:52.100,Wen Shichu bows before Lady Sourire.
00:25:53.960,00:25:54.830,温大人请起,00:25:53.780,00:25:55.400,"Please rise, Dr Wen."
00:25:55.520,00:25:56.230,谢小主,00:25:55.640,00:25:57.140,"Thank you, My Lady."
00:25:57.120,00:25:58.110,我们借一步说话,00:25:57.140,00:25:58.800,May I speak to you privately?
00:26:04.480,00:26:06.150,温大人是否还忙着时疫之事,00:26:04.240,00:26:07.760,"Dr Wen, are you still occupied with the treatment of the plague?"
00:26:06.480,00:26:07.150,无暇分身呢,,,
00:26:07.840,00:26:08.510,是,00:26:07.920,00:26:09.060,I am.
00:26:09.120,00:26:10.710,如果我有一事请求大人,00:26:09.060,00:26:12.600,Would you be willing to help me if I ask for a favor?
00:26:11.160,00:26:12.030,大人可否帮我,,,
00:26:13.600,00:26:14.590,我可以先告诉大人,00:26:13.700,00:26:15.580,"To be frank with you, sir,"
00:26:15.520,00:26:17.110,这件事情做成了未必有功,00:26:15.580,00:26:17.460,"helping me will not bring you any recognition,"
00:26:17.680,00:26:19.270,被人发现了或许还是大过,00:26:17.540,00:26:20.040,and may result in serious punishment if others find out.
00:26:20.480,00:26:21.310,可是我不做,,,
00:26:22.000,00:26:23.630,恐怕我心里会永远不安的,00:26:20.560,00:26:24.200,But my heart will never rest easy if I don't ask.
00:26:24.880,00:26:25.750,那么敢问小主,,,
00:26:26.280,00:26:27.670,若是微臣愿意去做,00:26:25.020,00:26:29.920,"My Lady, will it ease your mind if I am willing to do it?"
00:26:28.440,00:26:29.790,小主会不会安心些,,,
00:26:31.120,00:26:33.950,大人若肯帮我我自然会安心些,00:26:31.120,00:26:34.280,"If you help me, sir, my mind will be at peace."
00:26:35.440,00:26:36.550,为求小主安心,,,
00:26:37.200,00:26:38.510,微臣愿意尽力去做,00:26:35.660,00:26:38.900,"For that, My Lady, I will do everything I can."
00:26:39.840,00:26:40.990,但凭小主吩咐,00:26:40.060,00:26:41.960,I'm at your disposal.
00:26:44.240,00:26:46.830,存菊堂里的沈答应身患时疫,00:26:43.600,00:26:47.100,Companion Shen contracted the plague in the Chamber of Chrysanthemums.
00:26:47.160,00:26:48.030,性命垂危,00:26:47.100,00:26:48.500,Her life is at stake.
00:26:49.080,00:26:50.270,我想请你去帮她,00:26:48.800,00:26:51.240,I'm asking you to help her.
,,,00:26:51.300,00:26:52.000,But ...
00:26:51.600,00:26:55.710,只是她还是被禁足的嫔妃,00:26:54.400,00:26:55.880,she is a concubine in solitary confinement.
00:26:57.560,00:26:59.870,无论她是谁 只要小主吩咐,00:26:57.820,00:27:01.760,"No matter who she is, I will do what you ask me to"
00:27:00.160,00:27:01.230,微臣都会尽力去做,,,
00:27:02.360,00:27:03.710,只要小主能安心些吗,00:27:02.640,00:27:04.840,if that will bring peace to your mind.
00:27:05.880,00:27:06.710,多谢温大人,00:27:05.940,00:27:07.940,"Thank you, Dr Wen."
00:27:09.080,00:27:09.990,那微臣告退,00:27:09.280,00:27:12.460,"Allow me to take my leave, My Lady."
00:27:14.840,00:27:15.510,温大人,00:27:15.220,00:27:16.880,Dr Wen.
00:27:20.520,00:27:21.430,你自己也小心,00:27:20.640,00:27:22.660,Please take care.
00:27:30.680,00:27:31.790,东阿阿胶五钱,00:27:30.680,00:27:32.200,Five maces of Dong'e ejiao...
00:27:32.120,00:27:33.470,京城时疫闹得厉害,,,
00:27:33.800,00:27:35.270,皇上现在连饭都吃不下,00:27:32.300,00:27:35.440,"His Majesty didn't even have
the appetite to eat because of the plague."
00:27:35.760,00:27:37.550,你们赶紧着找出治疗的方子来,00:27:35.760,00:27:37.880,You must find the cure without delay!
00:27:38.000,00:27:39.430,是 微臣知道,00:27:38.000,00:27:39.440,"Yes, Your Highness."
00:27:40.040,00:27:41.070,娘娘少安毋躁,00:27:40.100,00:27:41.580,Your Highness must be patient.
00:27:41.560,00:27:42.670,这方子从来没有过,00:27:41.820,00:27:43.360,We have never had a prescription for an epidemic like this.
00:27:43.120,00:27:44.350,咱们这是瞎子摸象,,,
00:27:44.720,00:27:45.710,得一点点试着来,00:27:43.440,00:27:45.780,"We are like ""the blind men and an elephant"" - groping slowly."
00:27:46.000,00:27:46.950,什么一点点试着来,00:27:46.000,00:27:47.420,Slowly?
00:27:47.600,00:27:49.110,本宫就看不得皇上着急,00:27:47.600,00:27:49.500,I can't bear to see His Majesty so anxious.
00:27:49.640,00:27:50.550,微臣会尽力的,00:27:49.980,00:27:51.440,We are trying our best.
00:27:51.880,00:27:54.310,尽力 尽力都翻了好几天医书了,00:27:51.880,00:27:54.320,Are you? You've been searching the books for days.
00:27:54.680,00:27:55.630,也没看出来有什么结果,00:27:54.460,00:27:55.980,What have you found?
00:27:56.200,00:27:57.550,还不如本宫自己来,00:27:56.200,00:27:57.880,I might as well read this myself!
00:27:58.080,00:28:00.030,娘娘您都熬了好几个晚上了,00:27:58.080,00:28:00.440,Your Highness has stayed up for nights.
00:28:00.520,00:28:01.270,您要有什么不适,,,
00:28:01.680,00:28:02.830,微臣担当不起啊,00:28:00.540,00:28:04.160,We would be held responsible should Your Highness feel unwell.
00:28:07.840,00:28:09.390,大人您还不睡啊,00:28:08.080,00:28:10.660,"Dr.Wen, you should go rest."
00:28:12.240,00:28:15.470,差不多了 这个方子很快就成了,00:28:12.240,00:28:15.480,The prescription is almost completed.
00:28:16.440,00:28:19.390,大人这几天为了时疫的事,00:28:16.440,00:28:22.270,"Sir, you have been working hard day and night on the plague formula."
00:28:19.720,00:28:22.270,您日夜不安的 着实辛苦了您,,,
00:28:23.000,00:28:24.790,受人之托忠人之事,00:28:23.000,00:28:25.280,I have to be faithful to a promise.
00:28:25.600,00:28:26.830,无谓辛苦不辛苦,00:28:25.820,00:28:27.960,Work is not hard but duty.
00:28:28.200,00:28:28.870,是啊,00:28:28.380,00:28:29.560,Yes.
00:28:33.440,00:28:35.150,温大人辛苦啊 还不休息啊,00:28:33.680,00:28:36.460,Dr. Wen is still here. You have been working hard.
00:28:37.160,00:28:37.870,江大人,00:28:37.400,00:28:38.900,Dr. Jiang.
00:28:39.240,00:28:40.270,温大人这几日,,,
00:28:40.760,00:28:42.350,白日要照顾各宫嫔妃,00:28:39.420,00:28:42.720,"Dr. Wen, you have to take care of the concubines during the day,"
00:28:43.120,00:28:44.230,晚上还要忙着,,,
00:28:44.560,00:28:45.990,研制治疗这时疫的方子,00:28:43.340,00:28:46.400,and pursue the remedy for the plague at night.
00:28:46.720,00:28:47.710,着实劳累啊,00:28:47.000,00:28:48.840,You must be exhausted.
00:28:49.040,00:28:50.430,这方子可有进展啊,00:28:49.380,00:28:51.660,Did you make any progress on the prescription?
00:28:51.920,00:28:52.750,还没有眉目,00:28:52.020,00:28:53.300,Not yet.
00:28:53.240,00:28:55.070,不过我会尽力研制的,00:28:53.300,00:28:55.660,But I will do my best.
00:28:55.760,00:28:56.830,那你忙你忙,00:28:55.960,00:28:57.700,I’ll go now since you’re busy.
00:28:57.800,00:28:59.470,眉庄小主感染时疫,00:28:58.160,00:29:00.300,"After Lady Meizhuang was infected with the plague,"
00:28:59.720,00:29:01.830,戍守的侍卫唯恐避之不及,00:29:00.320,00:29:03.860,the guards were afraid to get close to her and thus slacking.
00:29:02.320,00:29:03.710,守卫十分松懈,,,
00:29:04.560,00:29:07.030,奴婢已经悄悄安排温太医,00:29:04.560,00:29:08.560,I have secretly sent Dr. Wen into her chamber.
00:29:07.400,00:29:08.550,前去医治了,,,
00:29:09.000,00:29:10.550,采月和采星还尽心吗,00:29:09.240,00:29:11.260,How are Lunar and Stellar?
00:29:11.200,00:29:14.270,十分尽心只是,00:29:11.260,00:29:13.540,They are very conscientious ...
00:29:15.240,00:29:17.070,温太医是偷偷去医治的,00:29:13.720,00:29:18.100,"Lady Meizhuang is not improving because Dr. Wen is treating her in secret,"
00:29:17.520,00:29:19.510,药物不足饮食又不好,,,
00:29:20.320,00:29:24.190,所以眉庄小主的病未见起色,00:29:18.500,00:29:25.300,so he can't order all the herbs or the nourishing food she needs to get well.
00:29:25.360,00:29:28.190,为今之计也只能尽心医治了,00:29:25.300,00:29:28.720,But I'm afraid that's all we can do for now.
00:29:29.440,00:29:30.310,是,00:29:29.660,00:29:31.740,"Yes, My Lady."
00:29:32.520,00:29:34.710,恭喜小主心愿得偿,00:29:32.520,00:29:36.020,"Congratulation, My Lady! Your wish came true."
00:29:37.680,00:29:38.350,苏培盛,00:29:37.900,00:29:39.000,Su Peisheng.
00:29:38.880,00:29:39.550,奴才在,00:29:39.000,00:29:40.000,Your Majesty.
00:29:39.800,00:29:41.350,宫里的时疫染得厉害吗,00:29:40.040,00:29:42.440,How serious is the plague in the palace now?
00:29:42.600,00:29:46.590,皇上 宫人杂役一个一个地没了,00:29:42.600,00:29:46.820,"Your Majesty, the servants died one after another."
00:29:47.040,00:29:48.510,到处人心惶惶啊,00:29:47.200,00:29:49.440,The palace is in a panic.
00:29:49.640,00:29:52.510,宫里都这样宫外就不用说了,00:29:49.640,00:29:52.800,"If so, it must be much worse outside the palace."
00:29:53.120,00:29:55.670,是啊 听说京城里有钱的人,00:29:53.100,00:29:57.500,"Yes, I heard that all the wealthy families
tried to escape town"
00:29:56.040,00:29:57.230,个个都想逃出去,,,
00:29:57.960,00:29:59.430,没想到一逃到京郊,,,
00:29:59.760,00:30:01.790,见到的都是得了时疫的老百姓,00:29:57.960,00:30:01.900,only to see the suburbs full of infected citizens.
00:30:02.240,00:30:03.590,就都又吓回来了,00:30:02.240,00:30:04.160,So they were frightened and came back.
00:30:04.280,00:30:06.790,听说京城还不算是最厉害的,00:30:04.280,00:30:07.580,I’ve heard that the city itself isn't the most affected area.
00:30:08.040,00:30:09.710,永平的庄子更厉害,00:30:08.040,00:30:10.160,The village in Yongping is more afflicted.
00:30:10.080,00:30:11.870,是啊 那些老百姓,,,
00:30:12.440,00:30:13.990,一早见谁得了时疫,00:30:10.240,00:30:16.640,"Yes, the villagers were locked up in quarantine
as soon as they showed symptoms of the plague."
00:30:14.240,00:30:16.630,就立即把他们关起来 隔开来,,,
00:30:17.160,00:30:18.510,那些被隔开的人,,,
00:30:19.440,00:30:21.910,除了死路一条就别无他路了,00:30:17.160,00:30:22.140,The detainees had no way out but death.
00:30:25.440,00:30:27.590,皇上 莞贵人在外求见,00:30:25.440,00:30:28.220,Lady Sourire requests an audience with Your Majesty.
00:30:28.160,00:30:29.550,这么晚了怎么还过来,00:30:28.220,00:30:29.960,At this time of the night?
00:30:29.880,00:30:31.550,是不是有什么要紧的事啊,00:30:29.960,00:30:31.740,"It must be something urgent, Your Majesty."
00:30:31.840,00:30:32.310,传,,,
00:30:32.520,00:30:33.150,嗻,00:30:32.020,00:30:34.080,"- Show her in.
- Yes, Your Majesty."
00:30:41.960,00:30:42.830,贵人万安,00:30:42.180,00:30:43.800,Peace to Lady Sourire.
00:30:44.480,00:30:45.630,皇上万福金安,00:30:44.740,00:30:46.740,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:30:47.680,00:30:49.430,什么事啊 这么急着见朕,00:30:47.860,00:30:50.780,What happened? Is it very urgent?
00:30:52.440,00:30:53.990,你们下去吧,00:30:52.440,00:30:54.000,You can go now.
00:30:54.840,00:30:55.390,嗻,00:30:55.020,00:30:56.580,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:31:01.160,00:31:01.870,说吧,00:31:01.260,00:31:03.100,Go ahead.
00:31:06.560,00:31:07.310,小允子,00:31:06.560,00:31:08.540,Xiao-Yunzi.
00:31:14.040,00:31:15.470,皇上面前还不抬头吗,00:31:14.160,00:31:16.340,You don't raise your head before His Majesty?
00:31:17.960,00:31:20.550,微臣刘畚给皇上请安,00:31:17.960,00:31:21.220,Liu Ben bows in respect before Your Majesty.
00:31:21.480,00:31:22.510,怎么是你,00:31:21.480,00:31:23.280,Why are you here?
00:31:23.600,00:31:24.710,臣妾始终不相信,,,
00:31:25.080,00:31:26.870,沈答应会为了争宠而假孕,00:31:23.600,00:31:27.000,"I never believed that Companion Shen
would feign pregnancy to gain favor."
00:31:27.240,00:31:28.750,所以暗中命人追查刘畚,00:31:27.240,00:31:29.320,So I secretly began to search for Liu Ben.
00:31:29.320,00:31:30.350,终于不负辛苦,,,
00:31:30.680,00:31:31.990,在永州边境找到了他,00:31:29.320,00:31:31.920,"They finally found him at
the border of Yongzhou, Hunan Province."
00:31:32.800,00:31:33.870,茯苓已被杖杀,00:31:32.500,00:31:34.420,The maid Poria was flogged to death.
00:31:34.520,00:31:36.350,刘畚为沈答应安胎多时,00:31:34.520,00:31:36.760,But Liu Ben was taking care of Companion Shen all along.
00:31:36.800,00:31:39.070,内中究竟没有人比他更清楚了,00:31:36.800,00:31:39.080,He is the only one who knows exactly what happened to Shen.
00:31:41.680,00:31:43.550,朕不会对你严刑逼供,00:31:41.800,00:31:44.260,I won’t force confession under torture.
00:31:44.600,00:31:47.150,只是今日你若要说半句虚言,00:31:44.600,00:31:47.600,"But if you dare to tell a word of untruth,"
00:31:48.440,00:31:50.990,朕会让你比死还难受,00:31:48.440,00:31:51.320,I will make you suffer more than death.
00:31:52.800,00:31:53.950,早说他被发现时,,,
00:31:54.240,00:31:55.950,已经混迹入乞丐以避追杀,00:31:52.800,00:31:57.020,"I heard that when he was found, he was
disguised as a beggar to avoid being discovered."
00:31:57.880,00:32:00.430,刘太医 你现在可以什么都不说,00:31:57.880,00:32:00.620,"Dr Liu, you don't have to tell us anything."
00:32:01.200,00:32:02.350,只是你现在不说,,,
00:32:03.080,00:32:04.390,我就会把你赶出宫去,00:32:01.200,00:32:05.000,"But if you do so, I will send you out of the palace right away."
00:32:05.480,00:32:06.830,想必你还未出京城,,,
00:32:07.240,00:32:08.350,已经身首异处了吧,00:32:05.800,00:32:09.440,"I bet they will cut off your head
before you can leave Beijing."
00:32:09.440,00:32:12.230,如此狼狈你若还不说实话,00:32:09.620,00:32:14.300,"If you still choose not to tell the truth,
you are digging your own grave."
00:32:12.880,00:32:14.150,那就是自寻死头了,,,
00:32:15.720,00:32:18.310,皇上 眉庄小主确无身孕哪,00:32:15.720,00:32:18.320,"Your Majesty, Lady Meizhuang was never pregnant."
00:32:19.520,00:32:20.270,朕知道,00:32:19.700,00:32:20.880,That I know.
00:32:20.720,00:32:22.710,其实眉庄小主自己也不知道,00:32:20.880,00:32:24.140,But Lady Meizhuang didn't know that herself.
00:32:23.080,00:32:24.230,自己真的没有身孕,,,
00:32:24.840,00:32:26.230,臣为小主安胎之时,,,
00:32:26.640,00:32:27.830,已明确无月事,00:32:24.840,00:32:28.140,"When she was in ""prenatal care"",
her menstruation had stopped."
00:32:28.680,00:32:30.710,而那些头昏呕吐等症状,,,
00:32:31.040,00:32:32.950,乃是药物所为 并非喜脉,00:32:28.680,00:32:33.260,"And her symptoms -- dizziness and
vomiting - were caused by medication, not pregnancy."
00:32:33.960,00:32:35.950,但臣在为眉庄小主把脉之前,,,
00:32:36.280,00:32:36.950,已奉命,00:32:33.960,00:32:39.960,"But before I took her pulse, I was ordered
to diagnose her with pregnancy regardless."
00:32:37.240,00:32:40.030,不管是何脉象均报喜脉,,,
00:32:40.480,00:32:42.830,奉命奉谁的命,00:32:40.480,00:32:42.840,You were ordered? By whom?
00:32:43.280,00:32:44.110,这,00:32:43.280,00:32:44.440,By …
00:32:45.320,00:32:47.950,她既要杀你你还要替她隐瞒吗,00:32:45.320,00:32:48.760,"She is going to kill you.
Why are you hesitant to say her name?"
00:32:49.920,00:32:51.710,华妃 是华妃,00:32:49.920,00:32:52.480,Consort Fleur. It was Consort Fleur.
00:32:55.240,00:32:57.310,你若敢有半句虚言,00:32:55.240,00:32:57.320,If you have told a single word of untruth ...
00:32:57.840,00:32:59.510,微臣不敢微臣不敢,00:32:57.840,00:32:59.800,"I dare not, Your Majesty, I dare not."
00:32:59.800,00:33:01.150,微臣自知死罪,00:32:59.800,00:33:01.700,I know I have committed a capital offense.
00:33:02.040,00:33:04.070,当日华妃娘娘给了臣银两,00:33:02.040,00:33:04.360,"Consort Fleur gave me a sum of money,"
00:33:04.400,00:33:06.230,让臣立刻离开圆明园避险,00:33:04.400,00:33:06.520,"and told me to leave the Summer Palace
at once to avoid trouble."
00:33:06.640,00:33:07.710,还安抚微臣说,,,
00:33:07.960,00:33:09.470,城内必有内人接应,00:33:06.640,00:33:09.880,"She assured me that I would be
aided when I got back to the city."
00:33:09.960,00:33:12.470,哪知一进城就有人一路追杀,00:33:09.960,00:33:12.780,"But as soon as I entered the city,
there were killers chasing after me all the way."
00:33:13.120,00:33:16.350,逼得微臣如丧家之犬一般哪,00:33:13.120,00:33:16.360,I was running around for life like a homeless dog.
00:33:17.960,00:33:20.230,小允子 带他下去好好看着,00:33:17.960,00:33:20.600,"Xiao-Yunzi, take him out and keep him under close watch."
00:33:20.800,00:33:21.710,不许出任何意外,00:33:20.800,00:33:22.340,Don't let anything happen.
00:33:22.120,00:33:22.790,嗻,00:33:22.440,00:33:23.780,"Yes, My Lady."
00:33:23.880,00:33:25.550,起来 走,00:33:23.880,00:33:26.020,Come with me.
00:33:28.800,00:33:29.630,皇上息怒,00:33:29.100,00:33:30.680,May peace be restored in Your Majesty.
00:33:30.560,00:33:32.590,刘畚的话会不会有,00:33:30.680,00:33:35.060,Is it possible that ... he has not told the entire truth?
00:33:33.480,00:33:35.030,不尽不实的地方,,,
00:33:35.560,00:33:37.830,其实沈答应当日之事疑点颇多,00:33:35.560,00:33:38.120,"There is much doubt over
what happened to Companion Shen."
00:33:38.080,00:33:39.230,只是苦无证据罢了,00:33:38.120,00:33:39.820,But we have no evidence.
00:33:39.960,00:33:41.030,如今细细想来,,,
00:33:41.280,00:33:43.670,如果沈答应真是几日前来红,00:33:39.960,00:33:43.860,"In hindsight, if Shen menstruated a few days before,"
00:33:44.120,00:33:45.150,那么那染血的衣裤,,,
00:33:45.680,00:33:46.630,什么时候不能扔,00:33:43.860,00:33:48.580,"why would she have her stained clothing
discarded right in Your Majesty's presence?"
00:33:47.040,00:33:48.350,非要在皇上在的时候扔,,,
00:33:49.520,00:33:51.190,还有沈答应曾经提起,,,
00:33:51.560,00:33:52.390,江太医给了她一张,00:33:49.520,00:33:53.880,"Also, Companion Shen mentioned that Dr. Jiang
had given her a prescription to help with pregnancy."
00:33:52.760,00:33:53.710,有助怀孕的方子,,,
00:33:54.360,00:33:55.870,偏偏要的时候就没有了,00:33:54.360,00:33:56.620,But it went missing right when we were looking for it.
00:33:56.680,00:33:58.030,若是真没有那张方子,00:33:56.680,00:33:58.700,"If the prescription never existed,"
00:33:58.520,00:34:01.030,沈答应无端提起岂非愚蠢,00:33:58.700,00:34:01.040,wouldn't it have been very stupid of Shen to mention it?
00:34:02.000,00:34:03.110,皇上恐怕不信,00:34:02.340,00:34:04.100,I’m afraid Your Majesty has the same doubts.
00:34:03.760,00:34:05.710,其实臣妾是见过那张方子的,00:34:04.100,00:34:06.180,I saw that prescription before.
00:34:06.400,00:34:08.390,当时看时也并没有觉得,00:34:06.400,00:34:09.600,It didn't seem improper to me.
00:34:08.720,00:34:09.590,有什么不妥,,,
00:34:13.640,00:34:17.350,华妃很好,00:34:13.640,00:34:16.040,Consort Fleur.
,,,00:34:17.020,00:34:19.100,Very well.
00:34:19.480,00:34:23.030,那张可以证明沈答应清白的方子,00:34:19.480,00:34:24.600,"That prescription to prove Meizhuang's
innocence was probably stolen."
00:34:23.400,00:34:24.230,大抵是被偷了,,,
00:34:24.960,00:34:26.790,那个叫茯苓的宫女,00:34:25.140,00:34:27.540,That maid called Poria...
00:34:27.720,00:34:29.230,只怕也脱不了干系,00:34:27.800,00:34:29.900,She must be involved in this.
00:34:30.160,00:34:33.310,朕当日一时气愤杖毙了茯苓,00:34:30.160,00:34:33.660,I flogged Poria to death that day out of unrestrained rage.
00:34:34.240,00:34:36.230,若是当日细细审问,00:34:34.240,00:34:39.040,If only I interrogated her instead.
00:34:37.440,00:34:39.030,今日也不至于此,,,
00:34:39.560,00:34:40.550,这也不能怪皇上,00:34:39.660,00:34:41.320,Your Majesty's is not to blame.
00:34:41.080,00:34:42.910,茯苓既然敢冤枉沈答应,,,
00:34:43.480,00:34:45.110,自然是咬死了不会反口,00:34:41.320,00:34:45.700,"Poria must have been determined to ruin Companion Shen
since she dared to defame her."
00:34:46.120,00:34:49.950,只是眼下皇上预备怎么办,00:34:46.240,00:34:48.080,But now ...
,,,00:34:49.100,00:34:51.100,What will Your Majesty do?
00:34:51.480,00:34:54.390,朕冤枉了眉儿放她出来,00:34:51.480,00:34:53.300,I wronged Meizhuang.
00:34:55.280,00:34:56.030,复她的位分,00:34:53.860,00:34:56.600,I will let her out and restore her title.
00:34:56.680,00:34:57.790,只怕一时出不来,00:34:56.860,00:34:58.220,I'm afraid it's too late.
00:34:58.000,00:34:58.790,难道她,00:34:58.220,00:34:59.860,Did she ...
00:34:59.080,00:35:01.750,不 眉姐姐并没有寻短见,00:35:00.440,00:35:02.880,"No, Meizhuang didn't have any suicidal thoughts."
00:35:02.720,00:35:05.470,只是忧思过度不幸染上了时疫,00:35:02.880,00:35:05.920,But contracted the plague due to depression and weakened Qi.
00:35:06.240,00:35:07.910,朕只是吩咐她禁足,00:35:06.420,00:35:09.820,There's was nothing for her to worry over.
00:35:08.360,00:35:09.830,她也未免太想不开了,,,
00:35:10.320,00:35:11.990,皇上禁足降罪于眉姐姐,,,
00:35:12.320,00:35:13.710,并不是极大的惩罚,00:35:10.340,00:35:14.060,Confinement may have been the only punishment imposed.
00:35:14.480,00:35:15.510,只是宫里的人,,,
00:35:15.880,00:35:17.750,哪个不是看着皇上的脸色行事,00:35:14.760,00:35:20.460,"But because she fell from grace,
all the servants in the palace disdain her."
00:35:18.520,00:35:20.390,于是奴才们更是一味地作践,,,
00:35:21.960,00:35:23.510,朕即刻传令太医,,,
00:35:24.640,00:35:26.390,去给惠贵人诊治,00:35:22.080,00:35:26.640,I will send imperial doctors to treat Lady Vertu immediately.
00:35:27.360,00:35:29.270,朕要她好好活下去,00:35:27.420,00:35:30.060,I won't let anything happen to her.
00:35:32.480,00:35:34.350,请皇上恕臣妾大不敬之罪,00:35:32.680,00:35:35.260,I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness for my offence.
00:35:35.120,00:35:37.070,臣妾见沈答应病重,,,
00:35:37.560,00:35:40.390,私下里已求了一位太医去救治了,00:35:35.260,00:35:40.540,"When I saw she was seriously ill,
I secretly asked an imperial doctor to take care of her."
00:35:40.880,00:35:41.550,当真,00:35:40.880,00:35:41.900,You did?
00:35:41.880,00:35:42.870,请皇上恕罪,00:35:41.900,00:35:43.600,I seek Your Majesty's pardon.
00:35:43.720,00:35:46.430,若不是你冒死行此举,00:35:43.960,00:35:46.920,"Had you not risked your life to safe hers,"
00:35:47.640,00:35:50.870,朕只怕真的要对不住惠贵人了,00:35:47.840,00:35:51.460,I would have been in eternal regret for Lady Vertu.
00:35:51.600,00:35:52.630,这不干皇上的事,00:35:51.660,00:35:53.460,Your Majesty did nothing wrong.
00:35:53.280,00:35:55.990,是奸人狡诈 蒙蔽了皇上慧眼,00:35:53.460,00:35:56.040,"The sly evildoer ""clouded your wisdom eyes""."
00:36:03.800,00:36:07.550,华妃如此愚弄朕 实不可忍,00:36:03.960,00:36:06.260,Consort Fleur fooled me into this ...
,,,00:36:06.600,00:36:08.380,I won't forgive her.
00:36:09.920,00:36:10.630,苏培盛,00:36:10.120,00:36:11.460,Su Peisheng.
00:36:15.920,00:36:16.590,奴才在,00:36:16.100,00:36:17.420,Your Majesty.
00:36:17.240,00:36:23.230,去太医院传旨 江诚江慎赐死,00:36:17.420,00:36:19.900,Bring my order to the Imperial Infirmary:
,,,00:36:21.000,00:36:23.680,Jiang Cheng and Jiang Sheng are granted suicide.
00:36:23.840,00:36:27.310,华妃褫夺封号降为贵人,00:36:23.780,00:36:27.660,"Consort Fleur is deprived of her
honorary name and demoted to Noble Lady."
,,,00:36:30.440,00:36:32.040,Wait.
00:36:30.320,00:36:36.590,慢着褫夺封号降为嫔,00:36:33.060,00:36:36.900,Deprived of her honorary name and demoted to Concubine.
00:36:37.800,00:36:40.910,皇上褫夺封号是极大的羞辱,00:36:37.700,00:36:42.800,"Your Majesty, the deprivation of honorary name is
a greater punishment than demotion."
00:36:41.240,00:36:42.750,远甚于降位的处分哪,,,
00:36:43.640,00:36:44.870,皇上这么动气是,00:36:43.720,00:36:45.200,What made Your Majesty so upset?
00:36:45.160,00:36:46.070,先去咸福宫,00:36:45.200,00:36:47.240,Go to the Palace of Universal Happiness first ...
00:36:47.040,00:36:49.510,说朕复了沈贵人的位分,00:36:47.240,00:36:50.880,Declare that I have restored Lady Vertu's status and honorary name.
00:36:49.880,00:36:50.790,封号也如旧,,,
00:36:51.760,00:36:53.270,好好给她治病要紧,00:36:51.800,00:36:53.480,Her health takes priority.
00:36:53.680,00:36:56.670,是 只是华妃娘娘降位的事,00:36:53.760,00:36:54.840,Yes.
00:36:57.240,00:36:58.350,如今夜已深了,00:36:54.940,00:36:58.360,But it's very late now.
00:36:58.800,00:37:00.630,若要让内务府再传旨,00:36:58.800,00:37:01.560,"If the Household Department delivers Your Majesty's decree now,"
00:37:01.320,00:37:03.630,只怕阖宫都会惊动,00:37:01.560,00:37:03.740,I'm afraid it will disturb the entire harem.
00:37:04.240,00:37:05.430,那就明日传旨,00:37:04.120,00:37:06.120,Then do it tomorrow.
00:37:07.240,00:37:09.430,先不要走漏了风声闹起来,00:37:07.380,00:37:09.520,Act as if nothing happened.
00:37:10.040,00:37:10.870,奴才知道,00:37:10.080,00:37:11.120,I understand.
00:37:11.200,00:37:12.950,奴才这就到咸福宫传旨,00:37:11.120,00:37:13.600,I will go to the Palace of Universal Happiness now.
00:37:20.560,00:37:23.430,嬛嬛 刘畚的事,00:37:20.640,00:37:22.520,Huan Huan ...
00:37:24.120,00:37:26.110,不会是你有意安排的吧,00:37:22.520,00:37:26.140,Did you arrange Liu Ben to ...
00:37:26.680,00:37:27.390,什么,00:37:26.760,00:37:27.960,What?
00:37:27.920,00:37:28.750,没什么,00:37:27.960,00:37:29.820,Nothing.
00:37:31.520,00:37:34.750,皇上以为是臣妾指使刘畚,00:37:31.800,00:37:36.240,Does Your Majesty think I instructed Liu Ben to defame Consort Fleur?
00:37:35.080,00:37:35.870,诬陷华妃,,,
00:37:37.800,00:37:39.630,皇上眼中臣妾是这样的人吗,00:37:38.040,00:37:40.720,Does Your Majesty think I'm that kind of person?
00:37:41.520,00:37:45.190,臣妾不敢 也不屑至此,00:37:41.700,00:37:43.380,I dare not ...
00:37:46.960,00:37:48.230,臣妾若真想指使刘畚,00:37:44.300,00:37:46.360,I am too proud to do that.
00:37:48.520,00:37:49.990,诬陷华妃营救惠贵人,00:37:47.160,00:37:52.160,"If I had intended to save Lady Vertu and defame
Consort Fleur, I wouldn't have waited until today."
00:37:50.720,00:37:51.990,大可早早行此举,,,
00:37:52.920,00:37:54.190,实在不必等到今日,,,
00:37:54.880,00:37:56.350,惠贵人性命垂危的时候了,00:37:53.000,00:37:56.420,I wouldn't have waited until Lady Vertu's life is in peril.
00:37:59.880,00:38:01.230,皇上若真不信臣妾,00:38:00.140,00:38:02.460,"If Your Majesty distrusts me,"
00:38:02.640,00:38:04.030,想必苏公公还未走远,00:38:02.720,00:38:05.040,Mr. Su can't have gotten far.
00:38:05.000,00:38:06.310,皇上大可收回旨意,00:38:05.040,00:38:07.200,Your Majesty can revoke the decree.
00:38:10.880,00:38:14.030,是朕多疑 朕若不信你,00:38:11.060,00:38:12.980,I was being suspicious.
00:38:15.160,00:38:16.630,也不会惩处华妃了,00:38:13.040,00:38:16.800,"If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't have punished Consort Fleur."
00:38:16.920,00:38:18.030,皇上若真信臣妾,,,
00:38:18.720,00:38:20.630,刚才就不会有此一问了,00:38:16.960,00:38:20.200,"If Your Majesty trusts me, Your Majesty wouldn't have asked that."
00:38:20.840,00:38:21.590,嬛嬛,00:38:20.260,00:38:21.660,Huan Huan.
00:38:27.040,00:38:27.910,臣妾失言,00:38:27.200,00:38:28.540,I misspoke.
00:38:28.800,00:38:30.950,知道就好 起来吧,00:38:28.940,00:38:31.400,It's all right. Rise.
00:38:32.920,00:38:33.670,谢皇上,00:38:32.920,00:38:35.060,I thank Your Majesty.
00:39:03.880,00:39:09.430,华妃服侍朕已久 体帖细微,00:39:03.880,00:39:09.440,Consort Fleur has always been thorough and attentive in her service.
00:39:11.480,00:39:13.390,素日里虽有些跋扈,00:39:11.480,00:39:14.840,"I thought she was just domineering sometimes,"
00:39:15.680,00:39:20.750,可是今日之事 朕实在是失望,00:39:15.680,00:39:20.760,but I'm really disappointed about what she did this time.
00:39:22.960,00:39:23.870,臣妾明白,00:39:23.060,00:39:24.920,"I understand, Your Majesty."
00:39:25.040,00:39:27.750,咸福宫大喜 惠贵人大喜,00:39:25.900,00:39:28.620,"Great news for the Palace of
Universal Happiness and Lady Vertu."
00:39:28.640,00:39:31.430,皇上已经下旨撤了惠贵人的禁足,00:39:28.640,00:39:31.440,His Majesty has lifted Lady Vertu's confinement.
00:39:32.280,00:39:33.950,一切封赏如旧,00:39:32.460,00:39:34.740,Her title and rewards remain the same as before.
00:39:34.840,00:39:35.910,谢皇上隆恩,00:39:34.840,00:39:36.920,I'm grateful to His Majesty.
00:39:39.200,00:39:40.070,恭喜,00:39:39.360,00:39:40.980,Congratulations.
00:39:41.600,00:39:42.750,谢谢苏公公,00:39:41.780,00:39:43.180,"Thank you, Mr. Su."
00:39:43.160,00:39:45.830,这真是沉冤得雪 这是大喜事啊,00:39:43.180,00:39:45.840,What a joyous moment of vindication!
00:39:46.160,00:39:46.830,是啊,00:39:46.160,00:39:47.520,Exactly.
00:39:48.000,00:39:52.910,可是惠贵人她不能亲耳早到,00:39:48.000,00:39:52.920,"But unfortunately, Lady Vertu cannot
hear the good news for herself."
00:39:54.560,00:39:56.430,怎么还没醒过来,00:39:55.520,00:39:57.940,Is she still unconscious?
00:40:04.200,00:40:06.510,温大人 小主烧是退了,00:40:04.200,00:40:06.700,"Dr. Wen, My Lady's fever has broken."
00:40:06.880,00:40:08.230,可是把药给吐出来了,00:40:06.880,00:40:09.080,But she vomited the medicine.
00:40:09.200,00:40:09.910,吐了多少,00:40:09.200,00:40:10.560,How much did she vomit?
00:40:10.280,00:40:11.630,喝三勺会吐一勺,00:40:10.580,00:40:12.600,About one third.
00:40:14.440,00:40:16.350,这的确是对症下药,00:40:14.440,00:40:18.400,But I did follow the prescription for her symptoms.
00:40:16.720,00:40:17.870,按方子熬的药,,,
00:40:18.840,00:40:20.390,或许是药性太烈了些,00:40:18.960,00:40:20.920,Maybe the medicine was too strong.
00:40:20.720,00:40:23.830,我再试着换一换可能就好了,00:40:20.920,00:40:23.840,I'll try to adjust the dosage.
00:40:28.840,00:40:32.750,温大人 小主可有起色,00:40:28.840,00:40:32.760,"Dr. Wen, is Lady Vertu feeling better?"
00:40:33.520,00:40:34.270,略有起色,00:40:33.660,00:40:34.860,A little bit.
00:40:35.160,00:40:37.030,可是小主的病发现得晚,00:40:35.260,00:40:37.440,But her illness was not promptly reported.
00:40:37.440,00:40:39.590,又病得太重 还没有醒,00:40:37.440,00:40:39.600,She is gravely ill and still unconscious.
00:40:40.200,00:40:41.190,容我再想想办法,00:40:40.200,00:40:42.780,Please allow me to some time to figure it out.
00:40:43.360,00:40:44.710,大人真是仁心哪,00:40:43.560,00:40:45.520,"That's very kind of you, sir."
00:40:45.520,00:40:46.830,早说大人已经在这儿,,,
00:40:47.200,00:40:48.310,待了一天一夜了,00:40:45.600,00:40:48.820,I heard that you have been here for over a day.
00:40:50.080,00:40:51.270,若是治不好小主,,,
00:40:51.840,00:40:53.590,微臣的心里有愧啊,00:40:50.080,00:40:53.600,I will have a guilty conscience if I cannot cure My Lady.
00:40:55.680,00:40:57.710,温大人如此尽心尽力,,,
00:40:58.040,00:41:00.990,奴才一定会禀报皇上 嘉奖大人,00:40:55.880,00:41:00.800,"For your tireless dedication, sir,
I will surely inform His Majesty to reward you."
00:41:02.360,00:41:04.710,小主如今时疫这么厉害,00:41:02.560,00:41:04.920,"My Lady, the plague is rampant in the palace."
00:41:05.120,00:41:06.830,咱们还要去看眉庄小主啊,00:41:05.120,00:41:07.520,Are we really going to visit Lady Meizhuang?
00:41:07.920,00:41:09.590,皇上下旨复了惠贵人,00:41:08.140,00:41:10.200,His Majesty reinstated Lady Vertu's title.
00:41:10.120,00:41:11.950,想必是惠贵人病得不轻,00:41:10.200,00:41:12.360,I'm afraid she is seriously ill.
00:41:13.080,00:41:15.910,不过你放心外头有侍卫拦着,00:41:13.320,00:41:17.780,"But don't worry, the guards won't let us in."
00:41:16.640,00:41:17.670,咱们也进不去,,,
00:41:18.560,00:41:20.110,在外头问候一声就是了,00:41:18.560,00:41:20.360,We will just send our greetings outside.
00:41:20.320,00:41:20.990,是,00:41:20.520,00:41:21.980,"Yes, My Lady."
00:41:23.680,00:41:24.630,安常在万安,00:41:23.680,00:41:25.360,Peace to Attendant An.
00:41:25.280,00:41:28.830,厦公公好 我来瞧瞧惠贵人,00:41:25.360,00:41:28.820,"Mr. Xia, I'm here to visit Lady Vertu."
00:41:29.160,00:41:30.070,太医在里面正忙着,00:41:29.160,00:41:30.840,The imperial doctor is busy taking care of her.
00:41:30.600,00:41:31.590,小主不便进去,00:41:30.920,00:41:32.540,"I'm afraid it's not a convenient time, My Lady."
00:41:32.480,00:41:34.630,何况时疫这东西不好沾染,00:41:32.540,00:41:36.360,"And since the plague is infectious,
you should stay away from here, My Lady."
00:41:34.960,00:41:36.350,小主还是远着些吧,,,
00:41:36.680,00:41:37.990,劳烦公公转告一声,00:41:36.680,00:41:39.540,"Sir, may I trouble you to inform Lady Vertu that I visited?"
00:41:38.360,00:41:39.390,我来看过惠贵人了,,,
00:41:39.760,00:41:40.870,奴才一定转告,00:41:39.760,00:41:41.680,"I will, My Lady."
00:41:41.880,00:41:45.310,对了 皇上怎么突然想起来,00:41:41.880,00:41:46.640,"Do you know ... why His Majesty
reinstated Lady Vertu so suddenly?"
00:41:45.680,00:41:46.990,恢复惠贵人的位分呢,,,
00:41:47.240,00:41:48.870,莞贵人没和小主说吗,00:41:47.080,00:41:49.560,"Didn't Lady Sourire tell you, My Lady?"
00:41:49.600,00:41:51.550,抓到害惠贵人的刘畚了,00:41:49.600,00:41:51.560,"The culprit, Liu Ben was captured."
00:41:51.880,00:41:52.630,真的,00:41:51.880,00:41:52.900,Really?
00:41:52.920,00:41:54.670,小主不信奴才 那就算了,00:41:52.920,00:41:55.020,"You don't have to believe me, My Lady."
00:41:56.080,00:41:57.110,你是御前的人,00:41:56.080,00:41:57.560,You are His Majesty's direct servant.
00:41:57.560,00:41:58.670,哪有不信你的道理,00:41:57.560,00:41:59.080,I believe you.
00:41:59.440,00:42:01.670,只是这消息来得太突然,00:41:59.640,00:42:03.400,"The news was unexpected.
What a wonderful surprise!"
00:42:02.120,00:42:03.510,实在是意外之喜呢,,,
00:42:04.040,00:42:05.870,小主信奴才就对了,00:42:04.040,00:42:06.320,"Exactly, My Lady."
00:42:06.560,00:42:09.670,抓到刘畚可有人要倒大霉了,00:42:06.560,00:42:09.680,"Someone will be in great trouble
now that Liu Ben has been caught."
00:42:13.480,00:42:14.230,是谁,00:42:13.480,00:42:14.580,Who?
00:42:14.520,00:42:15.310,这个不能说,00:42:14.580,00:42:15.780,I can't tell you now
00:42:15.840,00:42:17.750,说出来闹起来不好,00:42:15.840,00:42:18.440,because it would cause chaos in the palace.
