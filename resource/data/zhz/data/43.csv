00:02:23.890,00:02:25.970,皇上 皇后娘娘过来了,00:02:24.783,00:02:27.450,"Your Majesty,  Her Majesty has arrived."
00:02:28.190,00:02:29.550,皇上万福金安,00:02:29.334,00:02:30.960,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:02:31.230,00:02:31.810,快坐,,,
00:02:32.270,00:02:32.850,是,00:02:32.140,00:02:33.000,Have a seat.
,,,00:02:33.272,00:02:33.890,Yes.
00:02:37.320,00:02:39.030,都入夜了怎么还过来,00:02:38.335,00:02:40.097,Why did you come so late tonight?
00:02:39.360,00:02:40.190,有什么急事吗,,,
00:02:41.070,00:02:42.440,皇上今日走得急,00:02:40.188,00:02:41.960,Is there something urgent?
00:02:43.200,00:02:44.440,臣妾忘了问一句,00:02:42.080,00:02:43.585,Your Majesty left in a hurry earlier today.
00:02:45.450,00:02:47.280,过了除夕便是元宵了,00:02:44.035,00:02:45.700,I forgot to ask ...
00:02:47.660,00:02:48.740,今年的元宵佳节,00:02:46.525,00:02:48.600,"Lantern Festival is just around
the corner after New Year's Eve."
00:02:49.040,00:02:50.280,皇上喜欢怎么过,00:02:48.650,00:02:51.350,How would Your Majesty like to celebrate it this year?
00:02:51.000,00:02:54.370,太后的病一直都没有好,00:02:51.964,00:02:55.451,The Empress Dowager has not yet recovered.
00:02:56.050,00:02:59.040,朕也不想铺张 简单些就是,00:02:57.016,00:02:58.868,I don't want extravagance.
00:02:59.470,00:03:00.380,元宵新禧,00:02:59.000,00:03:00.320,A simple celebration should suffice.
00:03:00.840,00:03:02.750,皇上已赏了恩典给弘暄,00:03:00.480,00:03:03.885,"Your Majesty has awarded Hongxuan
a title as a grace of the new year."
00:03:03.390,00:03:05.340,也算是积福积善了,00:03:04.520,00:03:06.680,Your benevolence will accumulate good fortune.
00:03:06.010,00:03:07.750,那是莞嫔提醒了一句,00:03:07.040,00:03:09.000,It was Concubine Sourire who reminded me.
00:03:08.890,00:03:11.730,希望朕怜悯允俄一脉,00:03:09.840,00:03:13.565,"She hopes I will bestow some mercy
on the lineage of Yun-e."
00:03:14.150,00:03:17.440,臣妾有话 不知该说不该说,00:03:15.230,00:03:18.540,"I have something to say but
I am not sure if it's appropriate."
00:03:19.280,00:03:22.640,你我之间没有什么可避讳的,00:03:20.060,00:03:23.620,There should be no reservation between us.
00:03:23.120,00:03:23.820,是,,,
00:03:24.320,00:03:25.150,臣妾也是听到,00:03:24.000,00:03:25.000,Yes ...
00:03:25.490,00:03:26.950,皇上刚才说的才想起,00:03:25.340,00:03:28.450,It just occurred to me as Your Majesty spoke.
00:03:27.700,00:03:30.570,皇上 莞嫔她虽得恩宠,00:03:28.760,00:03:29.760,"Your Majesty,"
,,,00:03:29.880,00:03:31.880,"although Concubine enjoys high favor,"
00:03:31.160,00:03:33.200,可是有时候也失规矩了,00:03:32.160,00:03:34.360,she has overstepped boundaries at times.
00:03:35.170,00:03:37.660,皇后不是一向喜欢莞嫔吗,00:03:36.120,00:03:38.620,I thought you have always liked her.
00:03:38.210,00:03:39.250,今儿是怎么了,,,
00:03:39.630,00:03:41.340,正因臣妾看重莞嫔,00:03:39.230,00:03:40.560,What's the matter?
00:03:41.930,00:03:43.340,而她又即将封妃,00:03:40.635,00:03:42.840,Because I think highly of Concubine Sourire
00:03:43.640,00:03:44.720,所以不得不说,00:03:42.945,00:03:44.520,"and she will soon be promoted to Consort,"
00:03:45.600,00:03:48.510,皇上方才说弘暄封爵之事,00:03:44.580,00:03:45.960,I must say so.
00:03:48.810,00:03:50.970,是莞嫔提醒皇上的,00:03:46.692,00:03:52.560,"Your Majesty said Concubine Sourire
mentioned awarding a title to Hongxuan."
00:03:52.140,00:03:54.430,臣妾虽然欣慰莞嫔仁厚,00:03:53.176,00:03:55.587,"Although I am pleased with her compassion,"
00:03:54.940,00:03:58.350,可是也担心莞嫔不该置喙朝政,00:03:55.888,00:03:59.340,I worry that she shouldn't pass comment on state affairs.
00:03:59.320,00:04:01.400,弘暄的事也算是家事,00:04:00.296,00:04:02.436,Hongxuan's issue is also family-related.
00:04:01.700,00:04:02.900,自然说是家事,00:04:02.624,00:04:03.976,Of course.
00:04:03.240,00:04:05.600,但允俄谋逆之事便是国事,00:04:04.220,00:04:06.656,"However, the rebellion of Yun-e is a state affair."
00:04:06.490,00:04:08.610,家事与国事原为一体,00:04:07.456,00:04:09.820,Family issues and state affairs are interwoven.
00:04:09.040,00:04:10.320,正因为莞嫔心善,,,
00:04:10.910,00:04:12.900,臣妾才怕她真人蛊惑,00:04:10.032,00:04:11.960,I'm afraid that Concubine Sourire might be exploited
00:04:13.870,00:04:15.240,为他人做了嫁衣,00:04:12.036,00:04:14.600,because of her kindness.
00:04:15.500,00:04:17.080,自己都还不知道啊,00:04:14.970,00:04:17.967,And she might be unaware of the consequences.
00:04:17.670,00:04:18.530,这样说来,00:04:18.645,00:04:19.920,"In that way,"
00:04:19.210,00:04:22.670,莞嫔跟她父亲心思是一路的,00:04:20.130,00:04:23.760,Concubine Sourire thinks in the same line as her father.
00:04:23.470,00:04:27.510,都对朕不喜欢的人有怜悯之心,00:04:24.445,00:04:28.580,They both have sympathy for people I dislike.
00:04:29.100,00:04:31.550,莞嫔聪慧 臣妾也喜欢,00:04:30.145,00:04:32.780,I like Concubine Sourire for her intelligence.
00:04:32.310,00:04:34.520,可是说到懂得进退分寸,,,
00:04:34.900,00:04:35.850,安守后宫,00:04:33.375,00:04:37.169,"But when it comes to appropriateness
and adherence to duty in the harem,"
00:04:36.610,00:04:38.690,那安贵人和祺贵人,,,
00:04:38.980,00:04:40.350,却比她好许多了,00:04:37.620,00:04:41.600,"Noble Lady An and Noble Lady Délice
do much better than Concubine Sourire."
00:04:42.320,00:04:44.310,祺贵人也算是懂事,00:04:43.340,00:04:45.800,Noble Lady Délice is quite sensible indeed.
00:04:45.200,00:04:47.780,祺贵人到底是咱们满人的血脉,00:04:46.270,00:04:48.990,"After all, Lady Délice is from our Manchu families,"
00:04:48.450,00:04:49.440,不比莞嫔,00:04:49.530,00:04:50.860,"unlike Concubine Sourire,"
00:04:49.950,00:04:52.690,汉军旗的女孩子混着汉人的血,00:04:51.100,00:04:53.749,carrying the blood of the Han people.
00:04:53.080,00:04:55.490,怎么也不能算同心同德,00:04:54.020,00:04:56.760,She cannot have the same heart and mind with us.
00:04:57.290,00:05:00.780,自然了日久见人心,00:04:57.920,00:04:59.560,"Of course,"
00:05:01.130,00:05:03.290,莞嫔或许会做得更好,00:05:00.282,00:05:02.353,"""Only the passage of days reveals a person's heart."""
,,,00:05:02.353,00:05:04.360,Concubine Sourire may do better in the future.
00:05:12.390,00:05:14.470,儿子给皇额娘请安,00:05:13.320,00:05:15.580,Peace to Imperial Mother.
00:05:15.940,00:05:17.770,皇帝坐这儿,00:05:16.880,00:05:18.720,Sit here.
00:05:22.780,00:05:24.940,皇额娘的身子近来可好吗,00:05:23.660,00:05:25.940,"Imperial Mother, how's your health recently?"
00:05:25.240,00:05:26.320,还是老样子,00:05:26.230,00:05:28.000,Just the same as before.
00:05:28.320,00:05:30.190,新来的祺贵人喜欢吗,00:05:29.249,00:05:31.760,"Do you like the new Noble Lady, Délice?"
00:05:31.030,00:05:32.320,她是功臣之女,,,
00:05:32.910,00:05:34.490,皇帝可别冷落了她,00:05:31.935,00:05:33.880,She is the daughter of a meritorious official.
00:05:34.830,00:05:35.570,儿子知道,00:05:33.970,00:05:35.560,Don't be cold to her.
00:05:37.750,00:05:38.830,权衡之术,00:05:35.750,00:05:36.760,I understand.
00:05:39.380,00:05:41.490,后宫与前朝是没什么两样的,00:05:38.820,00:05:42.820,The methods of balance apply to harem and court.
00:05:42.130,00:05:44.160,皇帝自然能处理得宜,00:05:43.160,00:05:45.295,You can certainly handle them appropriately.
00:05:44.920,00:05:47.340,儿子谨记皇额娘教诲,00:05:45.925,00:05:49.120,"I will carefully remember your advice, Imperial Mother."
00:05:48.720,00:05:50.080,有了允俄的先例,00:05:49.715,00:05:51.560,"With the precedent of Yun-e,"
00:05:51.010,00:05:53.720,儿子对此次平难的有功之臣,,,
00:05:54.020,00:05:55.130,亦颇为小心,00:05:51.920,00:05:56.740,I have been prudent in awarding the meritorious officials.
00:05:56.350,00:05:58.510,并未授予太多的实权,00:05:57.380,00:06:00.180,I did not grant them much real power
00:05:59.600,00:06:03.310,对于入宫侍奉的功臣之女,00:06:00.710,00:06:06.450,and will not favor their daughters too much.
00:06:04.030,00:06:05.520,亦不会过分宠爱,,,
00:06:06.700,00:06:07.430,那就好,00:06:07.650,00:06:08.990,That's good.
00:06:09.490,00:06:12.230,自从年羹尧一事之后,00:06:10.560,00:06:13.300,"Since the incident with Nian Gengyao,"
00:06:13.200,00:06:15.780,儿子心中常怀警惕之心,00:06:14.250,00:06:16.960,my heart has been constantly vigilant.
00:06:17.330,00:06:19.040,但愿隆科多他,00:06:18.400,00:06:20.210,I hope that Longkodo
00:06:20.460,00:06:22.620,不要步年羹尧的后尘,00:06:21.400,00:06:23.735,will not follow Nian Gengyao's path.
00:06:26.090,00:06:26.950,他不敢,,,
00:06:27.470,00:06:28.420,但愿如此,00:06:27.045,00:06:28.200,He doesn't dare.
,,,00:06:28.475,00:06:29.480,I hope so.
00:06:30.680,00:06:33.540,只是皇额娘久在后宫之中,00:06:31.730,00:06:35.000,"But Imperial Mother, you've been in the harem so long"
00:06:34.260,00:06:37.100,已不能知隆科多的心思,00:06:35.355,00:06:38.200,that you aren't clear about his mind anymore.
00:06:39.100,00:06:41.640,哀家与隆科多相识数十年,00:06:40.219,00:06:43.228,"I have known Longkodo for decades,"
00:06:42.440,00:06:45.680,眼见他为先帝和你弹精竭虑,00:06:43.370,00:06:46.978,"and watched as he expended his thoughts
and energy for the late emperor and you."
00:06:47.740,00:06:52.110,皇额娘不是常说后妃不得干政吗,00:06:48.640,00:06:50.880,"Imperial Mother, haven't you always said"
,,,00:06:51.030,00:06:53.600,that concubines shouldn't interfere with state affairs?
00:06:56.330,00:07:00.160,前朝的事皇额娘无需担心,00:06:57.380,00:07:01.220,You need not worry about state affairs.
00:07:01.080,00:07:03.920,您只要安心养好自己的身子就是,00:07:02.100,00:07:04.940,You only need to take care of your health.
00:07:07.710,00:07:11.500,儿子前朝还有事 先回养心殿了,00:07:08.460,00:07:10.640,I still have unfinished tasks at court.
,,,00:07:10.860,00:07:13.000,I am going back to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:07:12.260,00:07:14.880,傍晚再过来给皇额娘请安,00:07:13.400,00:07:15.800,"I will visit you at dusk, Imperial Mother."
00:07:16.810,00:07:17.420,好,00:07:17.640,00:07:18.640,All right.
00:07:18.730,00:07:21.930,政事繁忙 自己也要当心身子啊,00:07:19.640,00:07:23.011,Look after yourself while you are busy with state affairs.
00:07:22.560,00:07:23.140,是,00:07:23.440,00:07:24.440,Yes.
00:07:28.990,00:07:30.650,皇上起驾,00:07:29.980,00:07:31.944,His Majesty departs.
00:07:34.490,00:07:35.950,你听皇帝的意思,00:07:35.460,00:07:37.920,Did you sense from his words that
00:07:37.160,00:07:40.200,是不是要狡免死 走狗烹,00:07:38.048,00:07:41.600,"""The hound will be killed once the rabbit has been caught?"""
00:07:42.080,00:07:44.740,上回哀家就听出这个意思了,00:07:43.080,00:07:45.740,I sensed so last time.
00:07:45.590,00:07:47.540,太后慈心布及天下,00:07:46.623,00:07:48.920,Your Majesty is benevolent to all under Heaven.
00:07:48.250,00:07:50.670,虽然有心也得顾及凤体,00:07:49.185,00:07:51.536,But Your Majesty needs to focus on your health
00:07:51.220,00:07:52.550,不能面面俱到,,,
00:07:52.970,00:07:54.550,平定年羹尧的时候,00:07:51.841,00:07:53.920,and cannot attend to everything of concern.
00:07:54.890,00:07:57.550,那隆科多大人也是出了力的,00:07:54.007,00:07:58.360,"Besides, Longkodo did contribute
his effort to pacifying Nian Gengyao."
00:07:57.810,00:07:59.260,各人自有各人福,00:07:58.760,00:08:00.720,Everyone has their own fortune.
00:08:00.060,00:08:02.390,哀家又能顾得到谁呢,00:08:01.069,00:08:03.720,There's no one that I can care for.
00:08:04.060,00:08:08.400,竹息 去把哀家的水烟袋点上,00:08:05.040,00:08:06.280,"Bamboo,"
,,,00:08:07.289,00:08:09.469,"light up my hookah [or bong, or water pipe]."
00:08:18.660,00:08:21.490,这本书不是已被皇上封禁了吗,00:08:19.560,00:08:22.980,Hasn't this book been banned by Your Majesty?
00:08:22.460,00:08:23.990,怎么养心殿就搁着一本,00:08:23.380,00:08:25.800,Why is there one in the Hall of Mental Cultivation?
00:08:25.710,00:08:29.420,虽然是禁书 朕也得时常看看,00:08:26.540,00:08:30.540,"Although it is banned, I also must review it."
00:08:30.300,00:08:32.250,得知道这些大逆不道之人,,,
00:08:32.550,00:08:33.910,成日里在想什么,00:08:31.240,00:08:35.280,"I need to know what these
outrageous people have been thinking."
00:08:38.100,00:08:39.840,你觉得这本书写得如何呀,00:08:39.100,00:08:41.400,What do you think of this book?
00:08:41.020,00:08:42.550,一派阿谈奉承之词,00:08:41.860,00:08:43.720,Flattering and fawning.
00:08:43.390,00:08:46.810,朕已将写这本书的汪景琪斩首示众,00:08:44.270,00:08:47.950,"I had the author, Wang Jingqi,
beheaded and his head hung in public,"
00:08:47.310,00:08:48.470,看谁还敢学他,00:08:48.280,00:08:49.720,to warn his potential followers.
00:08:49.070,00:08:51.730,皇上别再说了 臣妾听着害怕,00:08:50.000,00:08:51.680,"Your Majesty, please don't say that."
00:08:52.650,00:08:53.440,你怕什么呢,00:08:51.680,00:08:53.040,It scares me.
00:08:54.150,00:08:56.110,汪景琪有罪死不足惜,00:08:53.480,00:08:54.920,What are you afraid of?
,,,00:08:55.040,00:08:57.380,Death is not a pity for Wang Jingqi's offense.
00:08:56.780,00:08:58.150,可悬挂首级示众,00:08:57.740,00:08:59.360,But hanging his head in public
00:08:58.870,00:09:01.110,吓到的大多是无辜百姓,00:08:59.760,00:09:02.360,would mostly terrify innocent people.
00:09:02.200,00:09:03.440,臣妾还听说,00:09:03.240,00:09:04.640,I also heard that
00:09:03.750,00:09:06.330,皇上还流放了他的妻儿为奴,00:09:04.760,00:09:07.600,"Your Majesty exiled his wife and son to be slaves,"
00:09:07.000,00:09:08.330,连远亲都被革职了,00:09:07.900,00:09:09.760,and even discharged his distant relatives from office.
00:09:09.130,00:09:09.960,你怎么看,00:09:10.020,00:09:11.200,What do you think?
00:09:10.500,00:09:13.040,汪景琪有错他自己担着,00:09:11.420,00:09:14.400,Wang Jingqi was punished for his crime
00:09:14.380,00:09:15.790,若连他的家人亲眷,,,
00:09:16.720,00:09:18.080,连远亲都被连累到,00:09:15.300,00:09:18.980,but his family and even relatives
00:09:18.470,00:09:19.380,只怕有些无辜,00:09:19.220,00:09:20.380,are somewhat innocent.
00:09:20.310,00:09:21.590,若为此怨声载道,00:09:21.300,00:09:22.760,"If this raises discontent widely,"
00:09:22.140,00:09:23.260,臣妾替皇上不值,00:09:23.020,00:09:24.440,I would feel unworthy for Your Majesty.
00:09:24.430,00:09:25.920,你觉得朕做错了,00:09:25.320,00:09:26.980,You think I did wrong?
00:09:26.690,00:09:27.550,臣妾不敢,00:09:27.640,00:09:28.880,I dare not.
00:09:28.560,00:09:29.680,臣妾只是以为,00:09:29.560,00:09:30.960,I just think that
00:09:30.650,00:09:33.010,若能大事化小 小事化了,00:09:31.500,00:09:34.100,many more would feel grateful for Your Majesty
00:09:34.110,00:09:36.070,那会有更多人感激皇上的,00:09:35.000,00:09:37.920,"if ""major issues are reduced to minor ones
and minor ones to nothing."""
00:09:37.160,00:09:39.570,你到底是闺阁女儿,00:09:38.040,00:09:40.760,You are a woman living in a chamber.
00:09:40.450,00:09:42.440,不懂得男人的杀伐决断,00:09:41.380,00:09:43.720,You don't understand men's determination.
00:09:44.000,00:09:45.740,谁敢动摇朕的天下,00:09:45.020,00:09:46.880,"For those who threaten my sovereignty,"
00:09:47.330,00:09:49.910,朕就是错杀 也不能轻纵,00:09:48.080,00:09:51.040,I would rather be mistaken than sparing.
00:09:50.710,00:09:51.950,因为一旦轻纵,00:09:51.784,00:09:53.024,"Otherwise,"
00:09:52.960,00:09:55.080,便是拿江山社稷开玩笑,00:09:53.880,00:09:56.140,I am putting my country at risk.
00:09:56.590,00:09:58.330,是臣妾失言了,00:09:57.500,00:09:59.760,"Yes, pardon my remark."
00:10:14.480,00:10:16.190,碎玉轩已经修好了,00:10:15.280,00:10:17.320,The Palace of Pearl Jade has been restored.
00:10:17.070,00:10:18.900,你还是回碎玉轩去住吧,00:10:18.020,00:10:20.000,You should move back there.
00:10:21.160,00:10:22.570,怕是委屈了祺贵人,00:10:21.880,00:10:23.880,I am just worried that Lady Délice has been upset.
00:10:23.330,00:10:24.570,她挤在齐妃娘娘那儿,00:10:24.180,00:10:25.760,"She has to live with Consort Astuce,"
00:10:25.080,00:10:26.410,皇上要见她也不方便,00:10:25.820,00:10:27.880,inconvenient for Your Majesty to visit.
00:10:28.580,00:10:29.660,朕都想过了,00:10:29.440,00:10:30.960,I have thought about it.
00:10:31.250,00:10:33.870,碎玉轩还是给你一个人住比较好,00:10:32.000,00:10:35.080,"I think it's better that you live alone
in the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:10:35.090,00:10:36.330,朕每次去看你,,,
00:10:36.840,00:10:40.050,祺贵人都在一旁当真是不痛快,00:10:36.000,00:10:41.050,"I didn't like Noble Lady Délice
being around when I was with you."
00:10:42.390,00:10:45.750,那碎玉轩以后就给臣妾一个人住,00:10:43.230,00:10:47.080,"Then, I shall be the only one in the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:10:48.020,00:10:49.180,那春天的时候,00:10:48.840,00:10:50.360,"When the spring comes,"
00:10:50.100,00:10:51.390,臣妾就能和皇上,,,
00:10:52.110,00:10:53.770,对着满院的海棠饮酒,00:10:50.840,00:10:54.950,"we can savor liqueurs in front of
the flowering crabapples in the yard."
00:10:54.820,00:10:56.980,臣妾会在梨花满地的时候,,,
00:10:57.320,00:10:58.100,跳惊鸿舞,00:10:55.585,00:10:59.360,"When the snow-white pear flowers
cover the ground, I will dance the Startled Swan."
00:10:58.650,00:11:01.270,夏天的时候和皇上避暑取凉,00:10:59.475,00:11:02.700,"In the summer heat, we can shelter
together in the shade of the trees."
00:11:02.070,00:11:06.190,秋日里朕和你一同酿桂花酒,00:11:03.010,00:11:07.470,"In the autumn, I will join you to make osmanthus wine."
00:11:07.450,00:11:09.610,冬日看飞雪漫天,00:11:08.005,00:11:11.323,"In the winter, we can watch a sky of blowing snow."
00:11:10.960,00:11:13.950,朕要陪着你 你也要陪着朕,00:11:11.711,00:11:15.311,"I will always be by your side, and so will you."
00:11:15.380,00:11:18.710,嬛嬛要永远和四郎在一起,00:11:16.205,00:11:20.035,"I will always be with you, Si Lang."
00:11:34.770,00:11:35.930,莞莞,00:11:35.545,00:11:37.415,Sourisse ...
00:11:39.440,00:11:40.560,莞莞你在吗,00:11:40.215,00:11:42.000,"Sourisse, are you there?"
00:11:41.780,00:11:44.610,四郎 我在这儿,00:11:42.850,00:11:43.850,Si Lang.
,,,00:11:45.105,00:11:46.415,I am here.
00:11:58.920,00:12:01.210,小主 安小主一大早,,,
00:12:01.670,00:12:02.750,便在殿外等着您呢,00:12:00.000,00:12:04.020,"My Lady, Lady An has been waiting for you
outside since early this morning."
00:12:04.340,00:12:05.170,她等多久了,,,
00:12:05.680,00:12:06.760,都等了一个时辰了,00:12:05.200,00:12:06.560,How long has she been waiting?
,,,00:12:06.700,00:12:07.780,For about two hours.
00:12:08.010,00:12:10.760,那我快一些 别叫她等久了,00:12:08.930,00:12:11.980,I will hurry. I can't let her wait even longer.
00:12:14.190,00:12:14.890,妹妹好早,,,
00:12:15.230,00:12:16.020,给姐姐请安,00:12:15.330,00:12:16.160,"Lingrong, so early!"
00:12:16.860,00:12:17.850,我特地来等姐姐,00:12:16.215,00:12:17.520,"Peace to you, Sourire."
00:12:18.230,00:12:19.600,一同去向皇后娘娘请安,00:12:17.710,00:12:18.850,I came here
00:12:19.940,00:12:21.400,朕先上朝去了,00:12:18.885,00:12:20.665,so we can go to pay respects to Her Majesty together.
,,,00:12:20.865,00:12:22.560,I will go to court.
00:12:22.320,00:12:23.230,恭送皇上,00:12:23.360,00:12:24.400,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:12:23.530,00:12:25.610,莞莞 今晚依旧来这里,00:12:24.475,00:12:25.280,"Sourisse,"
,,,00:12:25.355,00:12:26.945,come tonight as usual.
00:12:29.200,00:12:29.820,走吧,00:12:30.100,00:12:31.000,Let's go.
00:12:34.330,00:12:35.910,你们俩来得也挺早的,00:12:35.275,00:12:37.155,You two have come early.
00:12:37.130,00:12:39.210,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:12:38.165,00:12:40.425,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:12:40.210,00:12:42.200,是该早些来向皇后请安,00:12:41.110,00:12:43.415,We should always be early to pay our respects.
00:12:45.510,00:12:46.800,你们得以晋封,,,
00:12:47.050,00:12:48.920,果然是比旁人懂得礼数,00:12:46.620,00:12:49.935,You both have the etiquette that deserves your promotions.
00:12:49.310,00:12:51.420,难怪皇上更宠爱你们,00:12:50.315,00:12:52.520,No wonder His Majesty favors you both.
00:12:53.100,00:12:55.590,若论宠爱 有谁能及姐姐呢,00:12:54.180,00:12:56.670,I can't compare with Sourire's favor.
00:12:56.440,00:12:58.430,今日早晨去养心殿等姐姐,,,
00:12:58.770,00:13:00.680,一同来跟皇后娘娘请安的时候,00:12:57.590,00:13:00.000,"This morning, as I waited outside
the Hall of Mental Cultivation"
00:13:01.110,00:13:02.770,谁知竟唐突了呢,00:13:00.000,00:13:02.015,"for Sourire to join me in paying respects to Your Majesty,"
00:13:03.070,00:13:03.680,陵容,00:13:02.085,00:13:03.940,I hadn't expected that I would be an inconvenience.
00:13:04.070,00:13:05.110,姐姐害羞什么,00:13:04.030,00:13:04.800,Lingrong.
00:13:05.820,00:13:07.560,皇后娘娘可是最疼咱们的,00:13:05.045,00:13:06.360,"Don't be shy, Sourire."
,,,00:13:06.825,00:13:08.960,Her Majesty has been so tender to us.
00:13:08.570,00:13:09.480,今日早晨,00:13:09.705,00:13:10.720,"This morning,"
00:13:09.700,00:13:12.280,臣妾听到皇上唤姐姐的小名呢,00:13:10.730,00:13:13.345,I heard His Majesty gave Sourire a new nickname.
00:13:12.540,00:13:13.240,莞莞,00:13:13.400,00:13:14.720,Sourisse.
00:13:13.790,00:13:15.950,皇后娘娘您别听安妹妹胡说,00:13:14.730,00:13:17.200,"Your Majesty, please don't listen to Lingrong."
00:13:16.790,00:13:20.380,莞莞 莞莞,00:13:17.795,00:13:19.025,Sourisse ...
,,,00:13:20.230,00:13:21.320,Sourisse!
00:13:22.760,00:13:24.620,莞是你的封号,00:13:23.900,00:13:25.760,Sourire is your honorary name.
00:13:25.260,00:13:26.420,皇上这样叫你,00:13:26.325,00:13:27.725,His Majesty must favor you dearly
00:13:26.840,00:13:28.500,必定是真的宠爱你啊,00:13:27.770,00:13:29.430,that he calls you by that.
00:13:30.010,00:13:31.130,妹妹一时嘴快,,,
00:13:31.510,00:13:32.590,姐姐可不要生气啊,00:13:31.060,00:13:32.440,I was just having a loose tongue.
00:13:33.270,00:13:34.260,下次再也不敢了,00:13:32.515,00:13:33.640,"Please forgive me, Sourire."
00:13:34.600,00:13:36.060,在宫里头都是姐妹,00:13:34.215,00:13:35.440,I will never do this again.
00:13:36.390,00:13:37.760,开个玩笑有什么,00:13:35.530,00:13:37.275,"In the palace, we are a family."
,,,00:13:37.425,00:13:39.120,Such teasing will be tolerated.
00:13:38.770,00:13:41.980,对了 安贵人封嫔的册封礼简单,00:13:39.795,00:13:40.640,"By the way,"
,,,00:13:40.700,00:13:43.270,"Noble Lady An will have a rather simple
promotion ceremony as a Concubine."
00:13:42.690,00:13:44.100,莞嫔你得候着,00:13:43.540,00:13:45.440,"While Concubine Sourire, you will need to wait."
00:13:44.570,00:13:46.360,还有你册封时的礼服,00:13:45.545,00:13:47.530,"Also, the robe you will wear at the ceremony,"
00:13:46.610,00:13:48.940,本宫觉得还有一点不妥,00:13:47.540,00:13:50.065,I feel that it needs some further revision.
00:13:49.620,00:13:50.780,到你册封那天,00:13:50.685,00:13:52.015,But don't worry.
00:13:51.120,00:13:53.360,本宫自会命人送去你宫中的,00:13:52.115,00:13:54.760,I will have it sent to your palace on the day of your ceremony.
00:13:54.450,00:13:55.530,谢皇后娘娘,00:13:55.515,00:13:56.760,I thank Your Majesty.
00:14:01.540,00:14:04.250,好大的一个疤呀 真是非常难看,00:14:02.460,00:14:05.360,Such a large scar! It's unpleasant to look at.
00:14:04.920,00:14:05.960,总算是结疤了,,,
00:14:06.260,00:14:07.460,难看些有什么要紧,00:14:05.880,00:14:07.160,It has finally become scarred.
00:14:08.300,00:14:09.630,前段时间老是化脓,00:14:07.220,00:14:08.760,Looking unpleasant is nothing
00:14:10.140,00:14:11.220,那才叫我害怕呢,00:14:09.240,00:14:10.760,compared to so much festering.
00:14:14.430,00:14:16.050,这是陵容给我的舒痕胶,00:14:11.200,00:14:12.360,I worried so much about that.
00:14:16.390,00:14:17.220,去疤是最好的了,00:14:15.490,00:14:18.360,"Lingrong gave me this Scar Relief Gel.
It's the most effective."
00:14:17.850,00:14:19.510,从前我被那只猫挠出伤痕,00:14:18.810,00:14:20.690,I was scratched by the cat.
00:14:19.900,00:14:21.640,你看如今都好了,00:14:20.800,00:14:21.680,And see?
00:14:22.150,00:14:23.230,果然是没有了,00:14:21.700,00:14:23.000,There is no scar now at all.
00:14:23.820,00:14:25.270,可是你的伤痕小,00:14:23.070,00:14:24.290,Absolutely.
00:14:25.570,00:14:27.600,我这个疤大怕是用不上吧,00:14:24.760,00:14:26.390,But your wound was small.
00:14:28.530,00:14:30.190,我那儿还有一些你先用着,00:14:26.450,00:14:28.920,"This scar is so large.
The gel may not be that effective."
00:14:30.740,00:14:31.570,若是觉得好,00:14:29.530,00:14:31.410,"I have more in my palace.
You can try this one."
00:14:31.910,00:14:33.070,我让陵容再配些过来,00:14:31.760,00:14:32.790,"If it's effective,"
00:14:36.000,00:14:37.580,小主 温大人到了,00:14:32.810,00:14:34.600,I can ask Lingrong to make some more.
00:14:37.910,00:14:38.700,要给您请脉呢,00:14:37.060,00:14:38.660,"My Lady, Dr. Wen is here"
00:14:38.960,00:14:39.660,快请进来,00:14:38.670,00:14:39.800,for your routine pulse-taking.
00:14:39.870,00:14:40.580,是,00:14:39.800,00:14:40.840,Show him in quickly.
,,,00:14:40.870,00:14:41.640,Yes.
00:14:41.170,00:14:43.910,你总嫌人家罗嗦 脉都不叫请了,00:14:42.090,00:14:44.970,"You don't like the tedious routine
of pulse-taking. And you refused it."
00:14:44.300,00:14:46.910,现在倒好他日日来烦我,00:14:45.240,00:14:47.930,"So, you see, he has been getting on my case."
00:14:50.220,00:14:53.460,真是挺香的 一闻便知是好东西,00:14:51.000,00:14:54.340,The gel is fragrant. It must be really good quality.
00:14:55.680,00:14:57.390,微臣给两位小主请安,00:14:56.160,00:14:58.530,Peace to My Ladies.
00:14:57.680,00:14:58.510,快请起来,00:14:58.540,00:14:59.770,Please rise.
00:14:59.230,00:15:01.060,温太医的礼数是最要紧的,00:15:00.170,00:15:02.140,Dr. Wen obeys the etiquette strictly
00:15:01.440,00:15:02.390,一刻都不放松,00:15:02.160,00:15:04.240,that he will never let himself miss a bow.
00:15:04.110,00:15:05.310,你又爱取笑,00:15:05.030,00:15:06.530,You are always teasing him.
00:15:07.280,00:15:09.310,请问小主这个是什么,00:15:08.260,00:15:10.450,"My Lady, I wonder what this is."
00:15:09.860,00:15:12.020,这个这是去疤用的舒痕胶,00:15:10.740,00:15:13.340,This is the Scar Relief Gel.
00:15:12.990,00:15:14.400,能否交予微臣看一看,00:15:13.990,00:15:15.640,May I have a look?
00:15:20.290,00:15:21.320,有什么不妥吗,00:15:21.070,00:15:22.480,Is there anything wrong with it?
00:15:21.960,00:15:23.240,本宫已经用了几盒了,00:15:22.740,00:15:24.480,I have used several boxes of this gel.
00:15:23.750,00:15:25.160,并未觉得有什么不妥,00:15:24.710,00:15:26.120,I haven't felt anything strange.
00:15:25.710,00:15:27.950,微臣一时也说不出什么,00:15:26.490,00:15:28.890,I can't confirm in such a short time.
00:15:28.550,00:15:31.160,能否交予微臣回去看一看,00:15:29.550,00:15:32.160,May I take this with me to examine it?
00:15:31.680,00:15:34.090,好那就请温太医好好看看,00:15:32.660,00:15:35.360,"Of course. Please give it a thorough check, Dr. Wen."
00:15:40.940,00:15:43.850,你说钱名世有一本古香亭诗集,00:15:41.940,00:15:45.400,"You said that Qian Mingshi has a poem collection
named as Aromatic Ancient Pavilion."
00:15:44.520,00:15:45.230,就是这个,00:15:45.500,00:15:46.690,And this is the collection.
00:15:45.940,00:15:48.810,奴才也是从甄大人那里知道,00:15:46.940,00:15:50.210,I know this book from Mr. Zhen.
00:15:49.740,00:15:51.940,得到了这本诗集 觉得还不错,00:15:50.780,00:15:53.080,He saw this collection and kind of appreciated it.
00:15:52.360,00:15:53.520,便拿回家中赏玩,00:15:53.340,00:15:54.720,"So, he brought it home."
00:15:54.370,00:15:55.320,但是奴才知道,00:15:55.370,00:15:56.600,"But to my knowledge,"
00:15:56.120,00:15:58.150,钱名世和年羹尧,00:15:56.900,00:15:59.680,Qian Mingshi and Nian Gengyao
00:15:58.490,00:16:00.610,是康熙三十八年的同年举人,00:15:59.680,00:16:02.360,"both passed the imperial examination
of the 38th year of Emperor Kangxi."
00:16:01.410,00:16:02.320,关系甚密,,,
00:16:02.960,00:16:05.160,钱名世既是谋逆罪臣,00:16:02.470,00:16:03.760,And they had a close relationship.
00:16:05.500,00:16:06.370,年羹尧的密友,00:16:04.020,00:16:07.960,"Since Qian Mingshi is a close friend
of the sinful rebel Nian Gengyao,"
00:16:07.300,00:16:08.710,那他所作的诗集,,,
00:16:09.260,00:16:11.370,想必是大不敬的诗集了,00:16:08.130,00:16:12.250,"it would be unsurprising if this was
a book of disrespect to Your Majesty."
00:16:11.630,00:16:13.840,那么甄远道是如何得到,,,
00:16:14.090,00:16:15.000,这本诗集的,00:16:12.410,00:16:16.060,"So, how did Zhen Yuandao get a copy?"
00:16:16.430,00:16:18.010,棋盘街上能买到吗,00:16:17.405,00:16:19.520,Was it available on Chessboard Street?
00:16:18.970,00:16:20.460,这诗集并未刊印,,,
00:16:20.850,00:16:22.930,只怕是钱名世的,00:16:19.845,00:16:21.935,This collection hasn't been published.
00:16:23.230,00:16:24.840,知己好友才能得到,00:16:22.200,00:16:26.325,"I'm afraid that only close friends of
Qian Mingshi can access it."
00:16:25.480,00:16:27.770,奴才也是在甄大人家见到,00:16:26.505,00:16:28.720,"I saw Mr. Zhen had this collection in his home,"
00:16:28.110,00:16:30.720,所以费尽心机才得到这一本的,00:16:28.760,00:16:31.795,so I went through all my sources to obtain this copy.
00:16:31.240,00:16:35.190,甄远道和年羹尧素无来往,00:16:32.240,00:16:36.240,Zhen Yuandao never had any contact with Nian Gengyao.
00:16:35.780,00:16:36.900,这朕是知道的,,,
00:16:37.410,00:16:38.360,奴才也是这么想,00:16:36.855,00:16:38.125,I know this clearly.
00:16:39.080,00:16:41.030,或许甄大人,00:16:38.385,00:16:39.600,I think likewise.
00:16:41.370,00:16:43.330,只是跟钱名世有所往来,00:16:40.155,00:16:44.575,"Maybe Mr. Zhen is only in contact with Qian Mingshi,"
00:16:43.580,00:16:45.820,不曾跟年羹尧有所交往,00:16:44.605,00:16:47.080,and has no relations with Nian Gengyao.
00:16:46.630,00:16:49.580,但是甄大人收留这本诗集,,,
00:16:50.090,00:16:51.540,只怕是另有深意,00:16:47.705,00:16:52.675,"Even so, Mr. Zhen's keeping this collection
could have obscure meanings, I'm afraid."
00:16:52.670,00:16:53.380,你说,00:16:53.595,00:16:54.560,Go on.
00:16:53.720,00:16:57.800,在这本诗集中分陕族旗周召伯,00:16:54.645,00:16:56.310,"In this collection,"
00:16:58.180,00:17:00.090,从天鼓角汉将军,00:16:56.315,00:17:01.440,"""He ruled Shaanxi as well as Zhaobo of Zhou Dynasty, and
defeated enemies miraculously like General Huo of the Western Han."""
00:17:00.470,00:17:02.890,和钟鼎名勒山河誓,00:17:01.445,00:17:02.120,And also
00:17:03.430,00:17:05.600,番藏宜刊第二碑,00:17:02.160,00:17:06.800,"""A monument should be built next to Emperor Kangxi's
memorial to scribe Nian's achievements in Tibet."""
00:17:05.940,00:17:09.600,这两句不仅是阿谈年羹尧之作,00:17:06.965,00:17:11.150,"These two lines are not only flattering Nian Gengyao,"
00:17:10.070,00:17:12.980,尤其后两句更是极力奉承,00:17:11.195,00:17:14.555,their following lines make the utmost effort
00:17:14.070,00:17:16.730,被皇上圈禁的十四王爷允禵,,,
00:17:17.240,00:17:18.570,和十王爷允俄,00:17:15.120,00:17:19.650,to praise the expeditions by Lord XIV and Lord X
00:17:18.870,00:17:20.480,当年西征之事啊,00:17:19.670,00:17:21.600,who are now confined by Your Majesty.
00:17:20.870,00:17:24.160,你是说甄远道收藏此诗集,00:17:21.895,00:17:25.835,Do you suggest that Zhen Yuandao keeps this collection
00:17:24.460,00:17:27.540,是因为同情允禵和允俄吗,00:17:25.860,00:17:28.680,because he sympathizes Lord X and Lord VIX?
00:17:27.960,00:17:28.790,奴才不知道,,,
00:17:29.090,00:17:31.250,甄大人是不是同情十四王爷,00:17:28.835,00:17:32.360,"I don't know whether Mr. Zhen sympathizes Lord XIV,"
00:17:31.590,00:17:34.080,但是莞嫔娘娘向皇上求情,,,
00:17:34.420,00:17:37.510,封爵与十王爷允俄之子,00:17:32.590,00:17:38.575,"but Concubine Sourire has pleaded Your Majesty
to grant a title to the son of Lord X."
00:17:38.180,00:17:40.040,这可是六宫皆知的事情,00:17:39.195,00:17:41.240,This is known by the entire harem.
00:17:40.510,00:17:42.930,就连祺贵人也当作美谈,,,
00:17:43.180,00:17:44.140,说与奴才听的,00:17:41.485,00:17:45.225,"Even Noble Lady Délice has told me
about this act of kindness."
00:17:44.980,00:17:45.680,鄂敏,,,
00:17:45.890,00:17:46.630,奴才在,00:17:45.930,00:17:46.720,Emin.
,,,00:17:46.815,00:17:47.880,Your Majesty.
00:17:47.140,00:17:50.480,你跟甄远道同僚共事一直和睦,00:17:48.015,00:17:51.505,"You have had a good relationship with
Zhen Yuandao as his colleague."
00:17:51.360,00:17:54.900,为何要向朕提及此诗集的事呢,00:17:52.360,00:17:56.025,Why do you report this to me?
00:17:55.400,00:17:56.640,奴才和甄大人共事,,,
00:17:57.200,00:17:58.610,私下交情也不错,00:17:56.275,00:17:57.965,"I am Mr. Zhen's colleague,"
00:17:59.200,00:18:00.980,但是奴才身沐皇恩,00:17:58.075,00:18:00.000,and I do have a good relationship with him.
00:18:01.580,00:18:02.740,只是报效皇上,00:18:00.250,00:18:02.455,But I am graced by Your Majesty's favor.
,,,00:18:02.480,00:18:04.215,I'm only devoted to serving Your Majesty.
00:18:03.540,00:18:05.950,其他私情 奴才不敢思虑,00:18:04.590,00:18:07.000,I dare not be distracted by any personal relations.
00:18:07.160,00:18:09.370,好 你跪安吧,00:18:08.110,00:18:08.920,Good.
,,,00:18:09.525,00:18:10.895, You may leave.
00:18:18.880,00:18:19.590,苏培盛,,,
00:18:20.090,00:18:20.800,奴才在,00:18:19.870,00:18:20.720,Su Peisheng.
,,,00:18:21.080,00:18:22.120,Your Majesty.
00:18:21.350,00:18:23.800,传莞嫔过来朕要见她,00:18:22.280,00:18:25.000,Bring Concubine Sourire here to see me.
00:18:24.270,00:18:24.970,嗻,00:18:25.290,00:18:26.240,Yes.
00:18:26.480,00:18:31.090,算了 朕还是去碎玉轩看她吧,00:18:27.230,00:18:28.625,No.
,,,00:18:29.350,00:18:32.150,I will go see her in the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:18:32.060,00:18:32.680,嗻,00:18:33.050,00:18:33.760,Yes.
00:18:33.690,00:18:35.180,你阿玛见过皇上,,,
00:18:35.480,00:18:36.890,皇上有没有说什么,00:18:34.565,00:18:38.360,"Did His Majesty said anything when
your father met with him?"
00:18:37.530,00:18:39.480,臣妾特意派人细细问过阿玛,00:18:38.455,00:18:40.560,I sent servants to ask my father carefully.
00:18:39.910,00:18:41.150,阿玛禀奏事宜后,,,
00:18:41.530,00:18:42.770,皇上的确什么也没说,00:18:40.835,00:18:42.200,But His Majesty said nothing
00:18:43.280,00:18:44.690,一丝生气也没有,00:18:42.430,00:18:44.000,after my father reported this matter.
00:18:45.370,00:18:47.330,阿玛说看不出,00:18:44.130,00:18:46.040,He wasn't angry in the slightest?
00:18:49.330,00:18:51.370,娘娘 是不是臣妾阿玛的话,00:18:46.345,00:18:48.760,My father said he couldn't tell.
00:18:51.710,00:18:52.490,没有说到点子上,00:18:50.355,00:18:53.640,"Your Majesty, maybe my father didn't get to the point."
00:18:53.290,00:18:56.250,年羹尧的事 皇上最忌讳功臣得势,00:18:54.265,00:18:57.493,"Since the settlement of Nian Gengyao, His Majesty has been vigilant of meritorious officials"
00:18:56.840,00:18:59.210,更深恨同情政敌之人,00:18:57.715,00:19:00.640,and resentful about sympathizers of his enemies.
00:18:59.930,00:19:01.260,年羹尧 允俄,,,
00:19:01.590,00:19:03.080,因为怜悯允禩 允禟,,,
00:19:03.470,00:19:04.630,就落得如此地步,00:19:00.950,00:19:06.060,"Nian Gengyao and Yun-e have paid their price for
pitying Yunsi and Yuntang."
00:19:05.260,00:19:08.630,更何况是刚得势的功臣心怀异念,00:19:06.260,00:19:09.775,"Let alone a newly-promoted official
who embraces disloyal intentions."
00:19:09.270,00:19:10.300,可是皇上并没有怪罪,,,
00:19:10.690,00:19:11.850,甄远道和莞嫔啊,00:19:10.270,00:19:12.800,"But His Majesty didn't blame
Zhen Yuandao and Concubine Sourire."
00:19:12.100,00:19:13.810,这才是本宫最担心的,00:19:12.980,00:19:14.840,That's exactly what I'm worried about.
00:19:14.770,00:19:16.690,本宫陪伴皇上数十载,00:19:15.715,00:19:17.680,I‘ve been with His Majesty for decades.
00:19:16.980,00:19:17.640,皇上什么性子,,,
00:19:17.990,00:19:19.730,除了太后 本宫最清楚,00:19:17.820,00:19:20.715,"I know his temperament best
apart from the Empress Dowager."
00:19:20.990,00:19:22.020,本宫很担心,,,
00:19:22.370,00:19:24.280,皇上为了莞嫔转了性子,00:19:22.010,00:19:25.335,"I'm worried that His Majesty has changed
his temperament because of Concubine Sourire."
00:19:24.620,00:19:25.650,那就难办了,00:19:25.445,00:19:26.625,That would be intractable.
00:19:25.910,00:19:27.740,莞嫔即刻就要封妃了 皇后娘娘,00:19:26.675,00:19:28.760,"Concubine Sourire will soon be
promoted to Consort, Your Majesty."
00:19:28.160,00:19:30.700,是啊 这么年轻就封妃了,00:19:29.210,00:19:31.750,"Yes, at this young age."
00:19:31.580,00:19:33.120,本宫人老珠黄,00:19:32.525,00:19:34.720,I'm old as a yellow pearl.
00:19:34.210,00:19:38.290,将来要退位让贤也未可知啊,00:19:35.230,00:19:39.310,I might have to abdicate the throne one day.
00:19:39.970,00:19:41.550,皇上驾到,00:19:40.915,00:19:43.250,His Majesty the Emperor.
00:19:46.890,00:19:48.000,皇上万福金安,,,
00:19:48.180,00:19:48.920,快起来吧,00:19:47.925,00:19:49.040,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:19:49.140,00:19:49.880,谢皇上,00:19:49.110,00:19:49.850,Rise.
,,,00:19:49.980,00:19:50.800,I thank Your Majesty.
00:19:54.270,00:19:57.010,你刚搬回来 朕来看看你,00:19:55.200,00:19:56.600,You've just moved back.
00:19:57.690,00:19:59.020,臣妾正想告诉皇上,00:19:57.015,00:19:58.600,So I came to see you.
,,,00:19:58.665,00:20:00.710,"Your Majesty, the Palace of Pearl Jade"
00:19:59.780,00:20:01.560,碎玉轩修缮得这样好,00:20:00.710,00:20:02.640,was restored so well.
00:20:01.950,00:20:04.310,臣妾都觉得太过华美了,00:20:02.880,00:20:05.240,I feel that it's too extravagant for me.
00:20:04.820,00:20:06.410,你就要晋封为妃了,00:20:05.720,00:20:07.760,You will be promoted to Consort soon.
00:20:06.870,00:20:09.530,自然该修整得稍稍好些,00:20:07.935,00:20:10.805,Your palace deserves to be conditioned
00:20:09.910,00:20:11.120,才衬得起你的身份,00:20:10.810,00:20:12.200,to suit your status.
00:20:13.580,00:20:15.370,皇上喝杯茶暖暖,00:20:14.570,00:20:16.760,"Your Majesty, please have some tea to warm up."
00:20:17.460,00:20:19.420,朕得了一本诗集,00:20:18.450,00:20:20.500,I've got a poem anthology.
00:20:19.760,00:20:20.840,特意拿给你瞅瞅,00:20:20.675,00:20:22.880,And I thought you should have a look.
00:20:23.970,00:20:25.050,钱名世是谁,,,
00:20:25.510,00:20:26.750,你看诗便是,00:20:24.915,00:20:26.350,Who is Qian Mingshi?
,,,00:20:26.545,00:20:28.080,Just read the poems.
00:20:39.400,00:20:40.730,也不算什么好诗啊,00:20:40.300,00:20:41.630,They are not that good.
00:20:41.690,00:20:43.150,你说这诗并不好,,,
00:20:43.570,00:20:44.940,外头也很难买到,00:20:42.635,00:20:44.350,The poems are not good
00:20:45.610,00:20:47.570,谁会特意寻来珍藏呢,00:20:44.515,00:20:46.200,and the book is not easily available.
00:20:48.240,00:20:49.610,大约是真心喜欢,00:20:46.675,00:20:48.960,Who do you think will keep a copy?
00:20:50.950,00:20:52.610,或者是知己好友的诗,00:20:49.275,00:20:53.440,Likely those who really appreciate the poems
00:20:53.250,00:20:54.410,才会寻来珍藏吧,00:20:54.265,00:20:56.393,or friends of the poet.
00:20:56.380,00:20:58.210,皇上怎么想起问臣妾这个,00:20:57.415,00:20:59.245,Why did Your Majesty ask me this?
00:20:58.630,00:20:59.620,朕随便一问,00:20:59.560,00:21:00.818,Nothing.
00:21:00.960,00:21:05.080,朕觉得这些诗曲尽诌媚,00:21:01.995,00:21:06.220,I just think these poems exhausted words of flattery
00:21:06.260,00:21:07.670,颂扬奸恶,00:21:07.340,00:21:08.960," to extol evils,"
00:21:08.680,00:21:12.670,这写诗的人也该革职逐回原籍,00:21:09.700,00:21:13.690,The poet should also be suspended and exiled.
00:21:15.600,00:21:16.890,臣妾看得不仔细,00:21:16.365,00:21:17.880,I didn't read these poems carefully.
00:21:17.350,00:21:18.590,只觉得诗作普通,00:21:18.250,00:21:19.920,I found them uninteresting.
00:21:19.480,00:21:22.100,倒也未见弘扬什么奸恶,00:21:20.410,00:21:23.200,But I didn't see any extolling of evils.
00:21:23.190,00:21:25.980,这写诗之人歌颂的是允俄,00:21:24.240,00:21:27.030,The poet was praising Yun-e.
00:21:29.660,00:21:30.940,是现在所写吗,00:21:30.620,00:21:32.699,Were these written recently?
00:21:32.120,00:21:34.160,是允俄 还是敦亲王时,00:21:33.095,00:21:35.400,Or back when Yun-e was State Prince Dun?
00:21:34.580,00:21:35.370,是从前,00:21:35.510,00:21:37.027,The latter.
00:21:38.080,00:21:39.370,敦亲王人在其位,00:21:38.935,00:21:40.930,"When he held the title State Prince Dun,"
00:21:39.880,00:21:41.740,奉承他的人自然不在少数,00:21:40.930,00:21:43.323,it's only natural that so many people adulated him.
00:21:42.840,00:21:45.170,这样的诗集一定也不少,00:21:43.845,00:21:46.175,Such anthologies must have existed in profusion.
00:21:45.630,00:21:48.670,那你说朕该如何处置呢,00:21:46.575,00:21:49.615,Then how do you think I should deal with the poet?
00:21:50.970,00:21:52.130,臣妾不敢妄言,00:21:51.915,00:21:53.320,I dare not comment.
00:21:52.600,00:21:55.640,你随便说 朕随便听着,00:21:53.575,00:21:55.070,Speak your mind.
,,,00:21:55.070,00:21:56.881,I won't mind.
00:21:58.060,00:21:59.470,既然时过境迁,00:21:59.155,00:22:01.280,Circumstances have changed as time passed.
00:22:01.230,00:22:02.810,皇上又何必要追究,00:22:02.295,00:22:04.360,There's no need to bring the poet to account.
00:22:03.610,00:22:05.770,只将这些诗作销毁便是了,00:22:04.540,00:22:06.922,Destroying the poems will be enough.
00:22:06.900,00:22:08.440,至于藏诗作之人,00:22:07.905,00:22:09.640,As for those who collect them ...
00:22:09.910,00:22:11.070,如果再重罚,00:22:10.930,00:22:12.600,"If severe punishments were imposed on them,"
00:22:11.660,00:22:14.280,反倒让人觉得皇上抓住此事不放,00:22:12.680,00:22:13.882,people would think that
00:22:14.700,00:22:15.780,弄得人心揣揣,00:22:13.882,00:22:15.373,Your Majesty wouldn't let it go.
,,,00:22:15.675,00:22:17.600,It's better to have the poems dissipating like clouds
00:22:16.460,00:22:18.990,倒不如风流云散也就罢了,00:22:17.686,00:22:19.950,rather than growing fear in people's hearts.
00:22:23.750,00:22:27.620,说得不错 朕再想想,00:22:24.755,00:22:26.040,Well said.
,,,00:22:27.375,00:22:28.960,I'll give more thought to it.
00:22:33.390,00:22:37.930,好了 你就要行册封礼了,00:22:34.320,00:22:35.520,All right.
,,,00:22:36.510,00:22:39.340,You will be having your promotion ceremony soon.
00:22:39.190,00:22:42.300,好好歇着 朕去看看祺贵人,00:22:40.235,00:22:41.520,Rest well.
,,,00:22:41.685,00:22:43.865, I will go check on Lady Délice.
00:22:51.620,00:22:52.950,臣妾恭送皇上,00:22:52.580,00:22:54.800,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:23:10.550,00:23:13.420,恭喜娘娘隆升莞妃,00:23:11.475,00:23:14.654,"We congratulate Your Highness on your
promotion to Consort Sourire."
00:23:13.800,00:23:14.540,都起来吧,,,
00:23:14.930,00:23:16.010,谢娘娘,00:23:14.815,00:23:15.654,You may rise.
,,,00:23:15.755,00:23:17.420,I thank Your Highness.
00:23:17.060,00:23:19.090,浣碧 你且去送送册封官,00:23:17.995,00:23:20.385,"Jade, go and see the master of ceremony off."
00:23:19.440,00:23:20.890,别忘了拿些贺礼过去,00:23:20.390,00:23:22.237,Don't forget to give him some gifts.
00:23:25.070,00:23:26.560,娘娘行完了册封礼,,,
00:23:26.860,00:23:28.570,别忘了去皇后宫中聆听教导,00:23:25.945,00:23:29.845,"Your Highness, remember to receive your instructions from the Empress after the ceremony,"
00:23:28.940,00:23:30.650,还要向皇上皇后谢恩呢,00:23:29.855,00:23:31.955,and thank Their Majesties too.
00:23:31.160,00:23:32.740,方才册封官已经提点过了,00:23:32.175,00:23:34.474,The master of ceremonies has told me.
00:23:33.620,00:23:35.650,流朱 把吉服拿来给我换上吧,00:23:34.525,00:23:36.865,"Vermilion, get my robe."
00:23:35.990,00:23:36.570,是,00:23:37.030,00:23:37.960,Right away.
00:23:41.120,00:23:42.200,来打开看看,,,
00:23:42.630,00:23:43.580,好生的精致,00:23:42.045,00:23:43.480,Let's spread it out!
,,,00:23:43.550,00:23:45.510,How exquisite!
,,,00:23:47.780,00:23:48.760,Oh no!
00:23:48.210,00:23:52.130,这这这可怎么是好,00:23:49.125,00:23:51.215, This... This...
00:23:52.470,00:23:53.800,册封用的吉服形同御赐,00:23:51.840,00:23:53.290,How can this be?
00:23:54.350,00:23:55.430,怎可有一丝损坏,00:23:53.420,00:23:55.314,"The ceremonial robe is considered
a reward from His Majesty."
00:23:56.680,00:23:57.670,等下若被发现,00:23:55.400,00:23:57.080,It cannot be damaged.
00:23:58.270,00:23:59.380,岂非是欺君大罪,00:23:57.665,00:24:00.945,"If discovered, this will be an offense to His Majesty."
00:24:00.640,00:24:03.180,流朱内务府的姜总管呢,00:24:01.635,00:24:04.315,Where's Chief Jiang from The Household Department?
00:24:04.520,00:24:06.230,刚送完贺礼还在院子里呢,00:24:05.495,00:24:07.755,He just brought the presents. He's still in the yard.
00:24:06.860,00:24:07.470,叫他进来,,,
00:24:08.070,00:24:09.150,快火速点,00:24:07.955,00:24:09.069,Call him in.
00:24:12.820,00:24:13.860,姜总管快,00:24:09.610,00:24:10.840,Go quickly!
00:24:16.580,00:24:17.660,姜总管你看,00:24:17.530,00:24:18.979,"Chief Jiang, look."
00:24:20.830,00:24:22.690,奴才办事不力请娘娘降罪,00:24:21.635,00:24:24.040,It's my mistake. I will accept Your Highness's punishment.
00:24:23.710,00:24:24.450,姜总管,,,
00:24:25.130,00:24:26.910,内务府送来的吉服竟有损坏,00:24:24.705,00:24:27.845,"Chief Jiang, this robe sent from the
Household Department was damaged."
00:24:27.340,00:24:29.120,若追究起来你也脱不了干系,,,
00:24:29.800,00:24:30.790,可本宫现在找你来,00:24:28.260,00:24:30.880,You can't escape the responsibility if His Majesty investigates.
00:24:31.170,00:24:32.380,并非是想要降罪与你,00:24:30.913,00:24:33.593,But I didn't bring you here to punish you.
00:24:32.760,00:24:34.340,而是希望你与本宫分忧,,,
00:24:34.720,00:24:35.750,看看可有补救的办法,00:24:33.765,00:24:36.870,I was hoping we could find a solution together.
00:24:36.100,00:24:36.800,回娘娘的话,,,
00:24:37.680,00:24:38.800,这册封的吉服,00:24:37.065,00:24:38.200,"Your Highness,"
00:24:39.140,00:24:41.300,是由几名织工以金银丝线织就,00:24:38.680,00:24:42.265,"this robe was woven from gold and
silver threads by several weavers."
00:24:41.980,00:24:44.220,所用丝线只够织这一件,00:24:42.895,00:24:45.620,There was only enough thread to tailor this one.
00:24:45.100,00:24:46.220,如果要缝补的话,,,
00:24:46.690,00:24:48.230,眼下恐怕要重开库房,00:24:46.105,00:24:49.004,"We would have to open the warehouse
if we wish to repair it."
00:24:48.860,00:24:50.190,这大张旗鼓不说,,,
00:24:50.480,00:24:52.350,怎么说也得三两天才能送回啊,00:24:49.770,00:24:53.360,"It will not only draw a lot of attention,
but also may take two to three days."
00:24:52.610,00:24:54.900,三两天已经来不及了,00:24:53.440,00:24:55.989,Two or three days? We don't have so much time.
00:24:55.070,00:24:55.730,是啊,,,
00:24:56.200,00:24:56.900,本宫现下,00:24:56.005,00:24:56.760,Exactly.
00:24:57.240,00:24:58.320,就要去皇后宫中谢恩去了,00:24:56.895,00:24:59.370,I have to go thank Their Majesties right away.
00:24:58.950,00:24:59.610,这,,,
00:24:59.910,00:25:00.990,小主不能再耽搁了,,,
00:25:01.370,00:25:02.280,要是误了时辰的话,00:25:00.585,00:25:02.239,"Your Highness, we can't stay for much longer."
00:25:02.620,00:25:03.910,皇上和皇后更要怪罪,00:25:02.240,00:25:04.920,Their Majesties would also blame us if we were late.
00:25:07.420,00:25:10.500,娘娘 有个办法或许能够救急,00:25:08.410,00:25:11.564,"Your Highness, I have a possible plan
for this urgent situation."
00:25:11.010,00:25:11.660,你说,,,
00:25:11.920,00:25:13.080,前两天皇后宫里,00:25:11.840,00:25:12.760,What is it?
00:25:13.380,00:25:14.670,拿了件衣裳来缝补,00:25:12.825,00:25:15.720,"A few days ago, the Empress sent over a robe for repairs."
00:25:15.430,00:25:17.380,那件衣裳颇有吉服的仪制,00:25:16.230,00:25:18.640,It quite follows the protocol of a ceremonial robe.
00:25:17.930,00:25:19.670,虽然不是和娘娘的这件很像,00:25:18.830,00:25:20.960,"Although it doesn't resemble this one,"
00:25:20.310,00:25:22.760,但若拿来换上应该能抵得过,00:25:21.220,00:25:24.020,it may be an appropriate substitute.
00:25:24.810,00:25:25.550,可以吗,00:25:25.680,00:25:26.760,Are you sure?
00:25:26.060,00:25:28.180,那件衣裳样子是老了些,00:25:26.980,00:25:29.460,The style of that robe is quite old.
00:25:28.900,00:25:30.930,恐怕是皇后娘娘以前穿过的,00:25:29.760,00:25:32.240,It was probably used by Her Majesty before.
00:25:31.610,00:25:33.390,因也补好了也没有催着要,,,
00:25:33.780,00:25:34.940,放着已经有两天了,00:25:32.640,00:25:36.035,But they haven't collected the mended robe for 2 days.
00:25:35.650,00:25:38.270,眼下也只有那件能抵得过了,00:25:36.540,00:25:39.540,It might be our only option.
00:25:38.950,00:25:41.070,既然能抵得过 那还不快去,00:25:39.860,00:25:42.380,"If so, you should go get it!"
00:25:41.620,00:25:42.230,嗻,00:25:42.700,00:25:43.808,Yes.
00:25:46.790,00:25:47.450,这,,,
00:25:54.130,00:25:55.290,皇后从前的衣裳,,,
00:25:55.670,00:25:57.670,哪怕稍微旧了一些也还是好看,00:25:55.090,00:25:58.789,"Although Her Majesty's robe is a bit old, it is still resplendent."
00:25:58.140,00:25:58.920,小主快些吧,,,
00:25:59.300,00:26:00.880,待会儿皇上皇后就该等急了,00:25:59.125,00:26:01.945,"Let's hurry, My Lady. Don't let
Thier Majesties wait for too long."
00:26:01.640,00:26:04.000,娘娘穿这身衣裳倒是很合身哪,00:26:02.520,00:26:05.120,This robe does fit Your Highness very well.
00:26:04.560,00:26:06.720,只是不知道看着怎么那么眼熟,00:26:05.580,00:26:07.960,But it looks so familiar somehow.
00:26:08.650,00:26:09.890,好像哪里见过,,,
00:26:10.560,00:26:11.270,是吗,00:26:09.440,00:26:11.280,I might have seen it somewhere before.
00:26:12.940,00:26:14.060,先管不了这么多了,00:26:11.560,00:26:12.600,Really?
00:26:14.490,00:26:16.020,赶紧去景仁宫要紧走吧,00:26:13.860,00:26:16.650,"No time to worry about that. Let's go to
the Palace of Great Benevolence."
,,,00:26:16.650,00:26:17.851,"Yes, let's go."
00:26:17.990,00:26:19.320,都是臣妾不好,00:26:18.900,00:26:20.680,"It's all my fault, Your Majesty,"
00:26:20.410,00:26:22.570,突然间头风发作了,00:26:21.370,00:26:23.600,to be having a migraine all of a sudden.
00:26:23.040,00:26:24.450,就怕耽误了吉时,,,
00:26:24.660,00:26:25.450,无妨,00:26:23.750,00:26:25.600,I'm worried if I will miss the auspicious hour.
00:26:25.870,00:26:27.410,等你好些了再出去,00:26:25.660,00:26:28.274,"No worries, you can go when you're feeling better."
00:26:29.750,00:26:32.870,皇上 娘娘 莞妃娘娘已经到了,00:26:30.710,00:26:32.280,"Your Majesties,"
,,,00:26:32.490,00:26:34.160,Her Highness Consort Sourire has arrived.
00:26:34.510,00:26:36.210,要不皇上你先去吧,00:26:35.510,00:26:37.320,Would Your Majesty mind going first?
00:26:36.840,00:26:38.170,臣妾随后就来,00:26:37.740,00:26:39.280,I will be right behind you.
00:26:38.800,00:26:40.760,行 朕先出去看看,00:26:39.870,00:26:41.850,"Sure, I will go out first."
00:26:56.690,00:26:57.430,莞莞,00:26:57.520,00:26:59.040,Sourisse...?
00:27:02.450,00:27:03.910,皇上万福金安,00:27:03.400,00:27:05.360,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:27:06.580,00:27:08.690,莞莞你怎么不唤我四郎了,00:27:07.580,00:27:10.080,"Sourisse, why didn’t you call me Si Lang?"
00:27:15.960,00:27:16.790,四郎,00:27:16.900,00:27:18.000,Si Lang.
00:27:19.420,00:27:20.160,莞莞,00:27:20.320,00:27:21.960,Sourisse!
00:27:40.450,00:27:43.230,莞莞你终于回来了,00:27:40.980,00:27:42.743,Sourisse ...
,,,00:27:42.921,00:27:45.138,You've finally come back to me.
00:27:57.090,00:28:00.200,臣妾甄嬛 参见皇上,00:27:58.078,00:27:59.743,Zhen Huan
,,,00:28:00.232,00:28:02.080,bows in respect before Your Majesty.
00:28:08.470,00:28:09.430,怎么是你,00:28:09.315,00:28:11.364,Why it is you?
00:28:17.020,00:28:19.190,臣妾参见皇上,00:28:17.880,00:28:20.480,I bow in respect before Your Majesty.
00:28:20.150,00:28:21.690,你这身衣服是哪儿来的,00:28:21.060,00:28:23.360,Where did you get this robe?
00:28:23.990,00:28:24.770,放肆,00:28:24.945,00:28:26.720,How dare you!
00:28:26.950,00:28:27.610,皇上,00:28:27.870,00:28:28.920,Your Majesty.
00:28:30.790,00:28:31.620,怎么会这样,00:28:31.570,00:28:33.000,How could this happen?
00:28:32.290,00:28:34.530,绘春 怎么会这样啊,00:28:33.380,00:28:35.880,Spring! How could this happen?
00:28:35.460,00:28:37.620,前些日子皇后娘娘整理,,,
00:28:37.960,00:28:39.420,纯元皇后旧时的衣服,00:28:36.465,00:28:40.895,"Several days ago, when Her Majesty
was sorting out Empress Première’s clothes,"
00:28:40.130,00:28:42.420,发现这件衣裳上掉了两颗南珠,00:28:40.920,00:28:43.760,two southern pearls were found to have come off this robe.
00:28:43.180,00:28:44.380,丝线也松了,00:28:43.975,00:28:45.760,"And the threads were loose, too."
00:28:45.140,00:28:47.250,就让奴碑拿去内务府缝补,00:28:46.120,00:28:48.728,"So Her Majesty asked me to send it
to The Household Department."
00:28:48.060,00:28:50.420,奴碑本想抽空就去把它拿回来的,00:28:48.980,00:28:51.420,I had wanted to take the time to bring it back.
00:28:51.680,00:28:55.520,谁知这两日事多给忘了,00:28:52.570,00:28:56.575,"But I forgot to do so among
other tasks in the past few days."
00:28:57.270,00:28:58.560,奴碑不知道为什么,00:28:58.315,00:28:59.699,I don’t know
00:28:58.860,00:29:01.350,这件衣服会跑到莞妃娘娘的身上,00:28:59.699,00:29:03.055,why this robe would be on Concert Sourire.
00:29:02.280,00:29:03.640,请皇上皇后恕罪,,,
00:29:03.900,00:29:05.140,请皇上皇后恕罪,00:29:03.280,00:29:04.600,I beg Your Majesties’ forgiveness.
00:29:05.610,00:29:06.400,糊涂啊,00:29:04.680,00:29:06.320,I do beg Your Majesties’ forgiveness.
00:29:07.320,00:29:08.910,本宫吩咐你们多少次了,00:29:06.560,00:29:07.751,How foolish!
00:29:09.280,00:29:11.150,纯元皇后的东西要好好保管,00:29:08.180,00:29:10.030,How many times have I told you
,,,00:29:10.040,00:29:12.440,that Empress Première’s belongings must be kept with care?
00:29:11.750,00:29:13.490,你们竟然当作耳边风,00:29:12.700,00:29:14.960,"And my command passed like
a puff of wind through your ears!"
00:29:14.410,00:29:15.820,其他的衣服就算了,00:29:15.320,00:29:17.160,It could be any other garment...
00:29:16.500,00:29:17.990,偏偏就是这一件,00:29:17.485,00:29:19.120,But it had to be this one!
00:29:22.260,00:29:24.540,这是她初次见朕的时候穿的,00:29:23.200,00:29:25.760,This is what she wore when she first met me.
00:29:26.130,00:29:27.290,皇上你还记得,00:29:27.155,00:29:28.520,Your Majesty still remembers ...
00:29:28.050,00:29:29.790,是姐姐第一次入王府,00:29:28.840,00:29:30.760,this is the robe that my sister wore
00:29:30.430,00:29:32.170,看臣妾的时候穿的,00:29:31.280,00:29:33.360,the first time she came to visit me.
00:29:33.060,00:29:35.600,自然是不能忘的 脱下来,00:29:34.000,00:29:35.850,I will never forget.
,,,00:29:35.940,00:29:37.320,Take it off.
00:29:45.150,00:29:45.980,臣妾大意,00:29:46.060,00:29:47.760,It was my negligence.
00:29:49.200,00:29:51.060,不想误穿了纯元皇后的故衣,00:29:50.080,00:29:52.880,"I didn’t realize that I am wearing
Empress Première’s old robe by mistake."
00:29:52.660,00:29:53.990,莞妃一向谨慎,00:29:53.605,00:29:55.480,Consort Sourire is always careful.
00:29:54.620,00:29:55.740,肯定不是故意的,00:29:55.580,00:29:57.160,She certainly did not intend this.
00:29:57.040,00:29:58.280,为什么 你说吧,00:29:57.900,00:30:00.000,Explain... Why has this happened?
00:30:02.170,00:30:06.330,臣妾来皇后宫中前 发现吉服破损,00:30:03.120,00:30:07.600,"Before I came to Your Majesty’s palace,
I found that my ceremonial robe was torn."
00:30:07.510,00:30:09.120,才向内务府借用此衣,00:30:08.440,00:30:10.560,"So I borrowed this robe from
The Household Department."
00:30:11.310,00:30:13.010,臣妾不知衣裳的来由,00:30:12.360,00:30:14.280,I didn’t know the origin of the robe.
00:30:15.480,00:30:19.680,不想冒犯纯元皇后 皇上恕罪,00:30:16.615,00:30:18.835,I would never intend to offend Empress Première.
,,,00:30:19.745,00:30:21.080,I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.
00:30:20.900,00:30:23.600,莞妃她 她,00:30:21.320,00:30:23.480,"Consort Sourire, she..."
00:30:23.780,00:30:24.510,莞妃,00:30:23.746,00:30:24.720,She…
,,,00:30:24.720,00:30:25.545,Consort Sourire?
00:30:25.860,00:30:27.440,虽然行过册封礼,00:30:26.760,00:30:28.720,"Although she has had the conferring ceremony,"
00:30:28.410,00:30:31.270,但还没听你的教导算不得礼成,00:30:29.220,00:30:32.880,"she hasn’t listened to your teaching,
and therefore the conferral is not completed."
00:30:33.200,00:30:34.740,碎玉轩已经修好了,00:30:33.980,00:30:36.000,The Palace of Pearl Jade has been well repaired.
00:30:35.830,00:30:37.440,你去待着思过吧,00:30:36.685,00:30:39.240,You can stay there and ponder upon your fault.
00:31:01.230,00:31:02.470,皇上口谕,00:31:02.060,00:31:04.000, His Majesty's order:
00:31:06.860,00:31:08.690,关闭碎玉轩宫门,00:31:07.685,00:31:09.860,The Palace of Pearl Jade will be shut
00:31:09.070,00:31:10.280,不得任何人出入,00:31:09.875,00:31:12.040,and no one is allowed to enter or leave.
00:31:12.070,00:31:14.240,你是谁呀 你要干嘛,00:31:13.055,00:31:15.320,Who are you? What's going on?
00:31:14.530,00:31:17.150,姜总管已被皇上下令杖毙,00:31:15.540,00:31:18.480,Chief Jiang was flogged to death by His Majesty's order.
00:31:17.660,00:31:20.400,本公公是新上任内务府总管,00:31:18.630,00:31:21.525,I am the new chief of The Household Department.

00:31:26.840,00:31:27.450,怎么回事啊,00:31:25.420,00:31:27.740,No!

00:31:31.840,00:31:32.920,小心你们的脑袋,00:31:31.012,00:31:32.491,"Be insolent if you dare,"
00:31:33.180,00:31:33.880,是 苟总管,00:31:32.493,00:31:33.962,at the cost of your own heads.
,,,00:31:33.969,00:31:35.040,"Yes, Chief Gou."
00:31:37.020,00:31:37.970,别吵了小主,00:31:37.900,00:31:39.280,Don't disturb My Lady.
00:31:39.480,00:31:41.180,姑姑 这可怎么办呀,00:31:40.460,00:31:42.300,"Madam, what should we do?"
00:31:50.110,00:31:50.940,娘娘,00:31:51.000,00:31:52.360,Your Highness ...
00:31:55.660,00:31:59.780,他们禁闭了碎玉轩 是不是,00:31:56.710,00:32:00.029,"They locked up the Palace of Pearl Jade,"
00:32:01.040,00:32:01.740,是,00:32:00.055,00:32:01.480,didn't they?
00:32:05.670,00:32:07.280,小主不要太难过了,00:32:02.010,00:32:02.880,Yes.
00:32:08.000,00:32:09.540,不能伤心坏了身子,00:32:06.590,00:32:10.650,"My Lady, don't be too sad,
for the good of your health."
00:32:12.130,00:32:16.090,关了也好 倒也清静,00:32:12.720,00:32:15.050,It's all right.
,,,00:32:15.982,00:32:18.480,At least I can have some peace now.
00:32:17.930,00:32:22.220,只是要连累你们和我一同受苦,00:32:18.920,00:32:23.580,I'm sorry that I dragged you all into this ordeal.
00:32:22.980,00:32:24.510,奴碑们不会有怨言的,00:32:24.020,00:32:26.080,We don't mind.
00:32:28.360,00:32:33.270,槿汐 从前我问你,00:32:29.385,00:32:30.811,Jinxi...
,,,00:32:32.910,00:32:34.913,I once asked you
00:32:35.320,00:32:37.310,为何会无故对我这样忠心,00:32:36.355,00:32:38.489,why you became so loyal to me.
00:32:38.870,00:32:40.480,你只说是缘分使然,00:32:39.920,00:32:42.000,You said it's the force of destiny.
00:32:42.870,00:32:44.330,如今可以告诉我了吗,00:32:43.560,00:32:46.240,Can you tell me the real reason now?
00:32:48.300,00:32:53.420,是因为我像纯元皇后是不是,00:32:48.825,00:32:51.905,It's because I resemble Empress Première.
,,,00:32:53.420,00:32:55.105,Isn't it?
00:32:58.850,00:33:01.340,小主和纯元皇后是有几分相像,00:32:59.680,00:33:02.740,"My Lady, you do somewhat resemble the Empress Première."
00:33:02.140,00:33:03.510,但也不十分相像,00:33:02.920,00:33:05.000,But not very much.
00:33:05.600,00:33:06.390,是吗,00:33:06.360,00:33:07.760,Really?
00:33:08.860,00:33:10.440,直到今日我才明白,00:33:09.460,00:33:12.000,I just realized today
00:33:12.990,00:33:14.440,端妃初次见我,00:33:13.941,00:33:16.000,why Consort Honnête seemed so surprised
00:33:16.660,00:33:18.360,何以为会那样惊讶,00:33:17.604,00:33:20.000,when she first saw me.
00:33:19.740,00:33:21.320,何以为会说那样的话,00:33:20.510,00:33:22.960,And why she would say I was a reminiscence.
00:33:23.750,00:33:25.860,她是宫里入宫最早的嫔妃,00:33:24.425,00:33:27.080,"She is one of the most senior
concubines in the palace."
00:33:27.330,00:33:29.370,自然熟悉纯元皇后的容貌,00:33:28.195,00:33:31.179,She must have known Empress Première well.
00:33:31.380,00:33:34.090,五分相似五分性情,00:33:31.775,00:33:34.899,The half resemblance in appearance and personality
00:33:34.550,00:33:36.040,足以让皇上情动了,00:33:35.160,00:33:37.500,is enough to capture His Majesty's heart.
00:33:37.010,00:33:40.800,五分容貌五分性情,00:33:37.920,00:33:40.000,Half resemblance ...
,,,00:33:40.755,00:33:42.774,in appearance and personality
00:33:43.850,00:33:45.970,就足以让你对我效忠是不是,00:33:44.685,00:33:47.200,"is enough to capture your loyalty, isn't it?"
00:33:48.230,00:33:53.270,不 你效忠的是纯元皇后,00:33:49.195,00:33:50.200,No.
,,,00:33:52.630,00:33:55.000,Your loyalty is dedicated to Empress Première.
00:33:54.530,00:33:58.440,娘娘 娘娘多虑了,00:33:55.390,00:33:56.640,Your Highness.
00:34:00.330,00:34:01.820,奴婢其实并没有福气,00:33:58.160,00:34:00.080,Your Highness is overthinking.
00:34:02.200,00:34:03.240,服侍纯元皇后,00:34:01.370,00:34:04.180,I wasn't fortunate enough to serve Empress Première.
00:34:04.290,00:34:05.700,只是因缘际会,,,
00:34:06.080,00:34:08.410,得到过纯元皇后的一次垂怜罢了,00:34:05.340,00:34:09.639,But she helped me once out of pity by chance.
00:34:10.460,00:34:11.540,而小主您,,,
00:34:11.880,00:34:13.620,也只有穿上纯元皇后的衣衫,00:34:11.500,00:34:12.809,"My Lady,"
00:34:13.880,00:34:15.420,才有几分真切的相像,00:34:12.810,00:34:16.640,"you only bear some true resemblance to
Empress Première when you put on her clothes."
00:34:16.550,00:34:18.710,纯元皇后为人太过纯良,00:34:17.510,00:34:19.760,Empress Première was too kind.
00:34:19.470,00:34:21.550,小主虽然有时也总是心软,00:34:20.490,00:34:22.840,"My Lady, although you are also soft-hearted,"
00:34:22.720,00:34:24.340,可却还有决断的时候,00:34:23.639,00:34:25.760,you can be decisive when necessary.
00:34:26.640,00:34:28.010,奴婢效忠小主,,,
00:34:29.270,00:34:30.600,其中是有几分,00:34:27.610,00:34:29.960,"I began to devote my loyalty to you, My Lady,"
00:34:31.310,00:34:33.050,纯元皇后仁慈的缘故,00:34:30.060,00:34:34.540,partly because I'm grateful for Empress Première's mercy.
00:34:33.780,00:34:36.390,但后来就完全是因为小主您,00:34:34.640,00:34:37.200,"But after that, it was only because of you."
00:34:36.700,00:34:37.980,如今的我已然失宠,00:34:37.270,00:34:39.360,Now I've lost His Majesty's favor.
00:34:40.660,00:34:44.120,今次不同往日恐怕难以翻身,00:34:41.600,00:34:45.530,I'm afraid there is no turn around like before.
00:34:46.500,00:34:48.410,你再对我效忠也是枉然,00:34:47.260,00:34:49.360,Your dedication would only be futile.
00:34:50.960,00:34:53.290,小主此番之事,00:34:51.995,00:34:53.000,My Lady.
00:34:53.710,00:34:55.000,奴婢也是有责任的,00:34:53.455,00:34:56.145,I'm also at fault for what happened today.
00:34:55.760,00:34:57.710,奴婢只是觉得那件衣衫眼熟,00:34:56.760,00:34:58.594,"I felt that dress was familiar,"
00:34:58.050,00:34:58.790,可怎么也没有想起来,,,
00:34:59.180,00:35:00.510,那是纯元皇后的旧衣,00:34:58.830,00:35:01.960,but I failed to recall that it belonged to Empress Première.
00:35:01.680,00:35:02.630,而姜公公以前,,,
00:35:02.970,00:35:04.430,并没有服侍过纯元皇后,00:35:02.695,00:35:05.400,Mr. Jiang also had never served Empress Première.
00:35:05.850,00:35:07.210,看样子咱们此番,,,
00:35:07.600,00:35:08.810,又中了别人的圈套,00:35:06.880,00:35:09.760,It looks like we have fallen into another trap again.
00:35:10.060,00:35:12.470,可怜姜公公已经被皇上下旨,,,
00:35:12.900,00:35:13.890,乱棍打死了,00:35:11.110,00:35:14.880,"Poor Mr. Jiang has been flogged to
death by His Majesty's order."
00:35:15.230,00:35:19.020,我不知他是受我牵连,00:35:16.235,00:35:19.900,I'm not sure if he was implicated by me
00:35:20.110,00:35:22.020,还是被算计的一颗棋子,00:35:20.875,00:35:23.080,or simply used as a pawn.
00:35:29.410,00:35:32.830,槿汐 我不该疑你忠心,00:35:30.260,00:35:31.360,Jinxi...
,,,00:35:32.120,00:35:34.226,I should not have doubted your loyalty.
00:35:34.920,00:35:36.830,就算你是因着纯元皇后,00:35:35.880,00:35:38.510,"Even if you are dedicated to me due to Empress Première,"
00:35:37.760,00:35:38.920,也是为我好,00:35:38.720,00:35:40.440,you did everything for my benefit.
00:35:40.340,00:35:41.380,可是皇上,00:35:41.290,00:35:42.760,But His Majesty...
00:35:45.310,00:35:50.270,皇后啊皇后 你真是费尽了心机,00:35:46.230,00:35:48.823,"Empress, oh the Empress..."
00:35:51.770,00:35:53.010,小主何以见得,00:35:49.534,00:35:51.920,You really have tried your utmost.
00:35:54.860,00:35:56.470,若不是皇后有意,00:35:52.560,00:35:54.600,"My Lady, why do you think so?"
00:35:57.730,00:35:59.770,谁能动得纯元皇后的旧物,00:35:55.720,00:36:00.880,"Who else can access Empress Première's clothes
without the Empress's instruction?"
00:36:00.860,00:36:02.440,何以为会这样凑巧,00:36:01.840,00:36:03.640,How can it be so coincidental!
00:36:04.120,00:36:06.610,蝗螂捕蝉 黄雀在后,00:36:04.460,00:36:08.260,"""The mantis catches the cicada, but the oriole is behind."""
00:36:08.290,00:36:09.820,我也不过是皇后手中的,,,
00:36:10.160,00:36:11.450,一枚棋子罢了,00:36:09.230,00:36:12.540,I'm just another pawn to the Empress.
00:36:11.960,00:36:13.820,小主对皇后并无不臣之心,00:36:12.780,00:36:15.400,"My Lady, you had no intention of
impinging Her Majesty's authority."
00:36:14.920,00:36:18.210,只是小主步步高升 又得盛宠,,,
00:36:18.920,00:36:20.660,想必是皇后忌惮,00:36:15.820,00:36:22.040,"However, your continued promotion and
high favor must have made her wary."
00:36:22.380,00:36:26.670,我既失君心 又不得皇后之意,00:36:23.460,00:36:28.000,I have lost favor from His Majesty and the Empress.
00:36:28.930,00:36:31.170,且此事又涉及到纯元皇后,00:36:29.800,00:36:33.080,"More importantly, this incident involves Empress Première."
00:36:32.730,00:36:34.840,这才是皇上的伤处所在,00:36:33.510,00:36:35.960,That is the wound on His Majesty's mind.
00:36:36.150,00:36:37.810,今日之事此番看来,00:36:37.080,00:36:38.673,It seems that
00:36:38.440,00:36:40.430,怕一时半会儿也无法转圆了,00:36:38.939,00:36:41.440,there is no immediate turnabout right now.
00:36:41.320,00:36:42.810,我们只能静待时机,00:36:41.900,00:36:44.320,We can only wait for the right time.
00:36:43.990,00:36:45.100,时机,00:36:44.960,00:36:46.360,The right time?
00:36:48.990,00:36:50.360,此时此刻,00:36:49.875,00:36:51.480,"Right now, right here;"
00:36:52.460,00:36:55.120,它和一座真正的冷宫有什么区别,00:36:53.460,00:36:56.360,How is it different from the Cold Palace?
00:36:56.580,00:36:57.490,小主,00:36:57.550,00:36:58.760,My Lady.
00:36:59.500,00:37:01.340,当日皇上为了保护我,,,
00:37:02.550,00:37:04.290,躲开前朝后宫的争斗,00:37:00.565,00:37:06.190,"His Majesty, in order to protect me
from the rivalries in harem and court,"
00:37:05.180,00:37:06.840,将我送去蓬莱洲,00:37:06.230,00:37:08.360,sent me to Penglai Island.
00:37:07.850,00:37:09.380,自是情意深重,00:37:08.685,00:37:10.760,He did it out of deep affection.
00:37:10.930,00:37:15.300,今日的幽禁又怎能同日而语,00:37:11.980,00:37:16.360,But my confinement today is not comparable.
00:37:20.780,00:37:23.390,罢了罢了,00:37:21.690,00:37:22.960,Forget it.
,,,00:37:23.780,00:37:25.000,Forget it.
00:37:27.620,00:37:32.280,莞莞在皇上心目中,00:37:28.345,00:37:30.000,Sourire...
,,,00:37:31.872,00:37:34.847,"In the eyes of His Majesty,"
00:37:34.500,00:37:37.460,我不过是纯元皇后的代替而已,00:37:35.160,00:37:38.545,I'm only a substitute for Empress Première.
00:37:49.100,00:37:51.710,皇上 您一晚上没吃东西了,00:37:50.080,00:37:53.000,My Majesty hasn't eaten anything all night.
00:37:52.220,00:37:53.630,喝点茶提提神吧,00:37:53.255,00:37:55.255,Please have some tea to refresh yourself.
00:37:59.690,00:38:03.680,放肆 你们都放肆,00:38:00.655,00:38:02.000,How dare you!
,,,00:38:03.535,00:38:05.260,All of you!
00:38:08.660,00:38:09.690,告诉内务府,00:38:09.685,00:38:10.999,Inform The Household Department
00:38:10.160,00:38:12.270,只许按答应的份例给莞嫔,00:38:11.075,00:38:13.560,"that Concubine Sourire will
only be provided for as an Attendant."
00:38:13.410,00:38:14.030,嗻,00:38:14.220,00:38:15.480,"Yes, Your Majesty"
00:38:25.340,00:38:27.750,娘娘这般轻重可好,00:38:26.315,00:38:28.800,"Your Majesty, how is the pressure？"
00:38:30.090,00:38:33.460,臣妾听说皇上在养心殿动怒了,00:38:30.800,00:38:34.560,"I heard His Majesty got angry
in the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:38:34.220,00:38:35.630,动怒是应该的,00:38:35.300,00:38:36.820,He should be angry.
00:38:36.680,00:38:38.890,最心爱的嫔妃犯了大错,00:38:37.840,00:38:40.160,"When his most favored concubine made a big mistake,"
00:38:39.310,00:38:40.680,皇上怎会不动怒,00:38:40.230,00:38:41.760,how could His Majesty not be angry？
00:38:41.020,00:38:43.480,可是为了一件衣裳,00:38:41.930,00:38:44.690,"But just for a piece of clothing,"
00:38:43.860,00:38:45.190,皇上不至于如此,00:38:44.895,00:38:46.320,His Majesty wouldn’t be like this.
00:38:45.490,00:38:48.190,纯元皇后是皇上最放不下的人,00:38:46.410,00:38:49.405,"Empress Première is the most
unforgettable person of His Majesty."
00:38:48.820,00:38:51.230,何况之前祺贵人的阿玛,,,
00:38:51.490,00:38:52.450,做了不少功夫,00:38:49.855,00:38:53.480,And Lady Délice’s father has worked hard in advance.
00:38:52.910,00:38:54.770,皇上早就恼了莞嫔了,00:38:53.915,00:38:56.040,His Majesty was already irked by Concubine Sourire.
00:38:58.460,00:39:00.070,姐姐呀姐姐,,,
00:39:00.330,00:39:02.120,你真是本宫的好姐姐呀,00:38:59.320,00:39:03.140,"Première, you are really my good sister."
00:39:02.630,00:39:04.120,哪怕死了那么多年,,,
00:39:04.920,00:39:06.830,您还是能够帮着本宫,00:39:03.535,00:39:05.680,"Even after so many years of death,"
00:39:07.340,00:39:09.050,护着本宫啊,00:39:06.000,00:39:10.540,you can still help me and protect me.
00:39:11.140,00:39:12.800,看来莞嫔这次,,,
00:39:13.180,00:39:14.540,是真的惹皇上生气了,00:39:13.000,00:39:15.920,"It seems Concubine Sourire has
really angered His Majesty this time."
00:39:15.390,00:39:16.970,倒是连累了姜总管,00:39:16.320,00:39:18.520,But Chief Jiang was implicated.
00:39:17.850,00:39:20.680,知道太多的人 命总是不长的,00:39:18.720,00:39:21.960,Those who know too much will never live too long.
00:39:21.860,00:39:22.590,娘娘,00:39:22.665,00:39:23.840,Your Majesty.
00:39:22.980,00:39:25.270,臣妾一定尽心尽力为娘娘效劳,,,
00:39:25.650,00:39:26.560,忠心于娘娘,00:39:24.080,00:39:27.890,I will put forth my best effort to serve Your Majesty.
00:39:27.150,00:39:30.110,你的心意本宫知道 起来吧,00:39:28.240,00:39:30.015,I know your thoughts.
00:39:30.360,00:39:31.150,是,00:39:30.312,00:39:31.160,Rise.
,,,00:39:31.375,00:39:32.040,Yes.
00:39:36.240,00:39:38.740,如今莞嫔被囚禁,00:39:37.325,00:39:40.000,"Although Concubine Sourire is grounded,"
00:39:39.540,00:39:42.620,臣妾担心皇上生莞嫔的气,00:39:40.610,00:39:44.920,I worry that His Majesty’s anger will only be temporary.
00:39:42.920,00:39:43.910,也只是一时的,,,
00:39:44.840,00:39:46.290,若皇上再度垂怜,00:39:45.580,00:39:47.560,"If His Majesty favors her again,"
00:39:47.010,00:39:49.120,只怕白费了娘娘的一番心血,00:39:47.920,00:39:50.280,I'm afraid it will be a waste of all the effort.
00:39:49.380,00:39:51.840,这次就算皇上再肯垂怜,00:39:50.320,00:39:53.000,"This time, however much His Majesty would pity her,"
00:39:52.260,00:39:54.300,只怕莞嫔也回不了头了,00:39:53.290,00:39:55.720,I'm afraid Concubine Sourire is not turning back.
00:39:55.050,00:39:56.510,莞嫔心性这么高,00:39:56.120,00:39:58.320,Concubine Sourire is not a person to swallow her pride.
00:39:57.470,00:39:59.680,明白这些年的恩爱相守,00:39:58.475,00:40:00.820,How can she reconcile herself
00:39:59.930,00:40:01.520,都只不过是替身罢了,00:40:00.835,00:40:02.900,when she realizes that all these years of affection
00:40:02.100,00:40:03.390,她怎能甘心呢,00:40:02.920,00:40:05.095,is all because of her being a substitute?
00:40:05.980,00:40:07.220,娘娘一番心思,00:40:06.970,00:40:08.480,Your Majesty's effort
00:40:07.730,00:40:10.270,原来只为断了莞嫔的念头,00:40:08.620,00:40:11.360,turned out to be extinguishing her hope.
00:40:11.110,00:40:12.190,臣妾拜服,00:40:12.045,00:40:13.760,I admire Your Majesty.
00:40:16.620,00:40:18.400,娘娘惠贵人求见,00:40:17.615,00:40:19.760,"Your Majesty, Lady Vertu requests an audience."
00:40:19.080,00:40:20.410,为了莞嫔的事吗,00:40:20.080,00:40:21.520,Is she here for Concubine Sourire?
00:40:20.750,00:40:22.280,她急得很多半是,00:40:21.675,00:40:23.440,Probably. She’s very anxious.
00:40:22.710,00:40:24.790,本宫不想见她 打发她走吧,00:40:23.710,00:40:25.960,I don’t want to see her. Give her a reason to leave.
00:40:25.290,00:40:25.950,是,00:40:26.310,00:40:28.000,Yes.
00:40:35.850,00:40:38.510,惠贵人 娘娘头风发作,00:40:36.860,00:40:39.825,"Lady Vertu, Her Majesty had a migraine attack."
00:40:38.890,00:40:40.130,服过药已经睡下了,,,
00:40:40.560,00:40:42.050,那 那等皇后娘娘醒了,00:40:39.990,00:40:41.285,She is already asleep after taking some medicine.
00:40:42.390,00:40:44.130,请姑姑一定代我向皇后通传,00:40:41.620,00:40:45.270,"When Her Majesty wakes up, please inform
Her Majesty of my request for an audience."
00:40:44.400,00:40:45.100,那是自然,,,
00:40:45.440,00:40:46.890,等娘娘好一些有精神了,00:40:45.270,00:40:46.210,Certainly.
00:40:47.320,00:40:48.300,奴婢定会通传,00:40:46.445,00:40:47.890,"When Her Majesty is better,"
,,,00:40:48.330,00:40:49.480,I will definitely inform her.
00:40:54.030,00:40:55.770,采月 陪我去寿康宫,00:40:55.150,00:40:57.000,"Lunar, let’s go to the Palace of Longevity."
00:40:56.530,00:40:57.150,小主,00:40:57.420,00:40:58.340,"My Lady,"
00:40:57.700,00:40:59.940,太后这个时辰恐怕已经睡下了,00:40:58.840,00:41:01.080,I'm afraid the Empress Dowager is already asleep.
00:41:00.370,00:41:02.700,皇上不见我 皇后也不见我,00:41:01.600,00:41:03.830,"I couldn't see His Majesty, nor Her Majesty."
00:41:03.080,00:41:04.160,若再不去求太后,,,
00:41:04.500,00:41:05.410,那该怎么办呢,00:41:04.045,00:41:06.520,"What else can I do if I don’t ask
the Empress Dowager for help?"
00:41:06.170,00:41:07.410,太后一直身子不适,,,
00:41:07.790,00:41:09.160,此刻惊扰她老人家不好,00:41:07.180,00:41:08.600,The Empress Dowager has been unwell.
00:41:09.840,00:41:11.000,现在外面太冷了,00:41:08.720,00:41:10.320,It’s not good to disturb her at this time.
00:41:11.340,00:41:12.750,小主不如明日再去吧,00:41:10.880,00:41:12.200,"It’s too cold outside,"
00:41:13.050,00:41:13.880,顾不得那么多了,00:41:12.335,00:41:13.840,"you might as well go tomorrow, My Lady."
00:41:14.180,00:41:15.160,你赶紧陪我去寿康宫,00:41:13.980,00:41:15.000,I can’t worry about that.
00:41:15.800,00:41:16.460,小主,00:41:15.020,00:41:16.265,Let’s go to the Palace of Longevity!
,,,00:41:16.920,00:41:17.760,My Lady!
00:41:28.400,00:41:29.010,小主,00:41:29.515,00:41:30.160,My Lady.
00:41:31.150,00:41:32.980,姑姑太后睡下了吗,00:41:32.380,00:41:34.005,"Madam, is Her Majesty asleep?"
00:41:33.280,00:41:34.270,太后倒是没睡,00:41:34.165,00:41:35.400,"Her Majesty isn't,"
00:41:34.700,00:41:36.190,可是没有工夫见贵人,00:41:35.700,00:41:37.360,but she wouldn't spare time to see you.
00:41:36.950,00:41:39.310,怎么太后不愿意见我,00:41:38.057,00:41:38.840,Why?
,,,00:41:38.995,00:41:40.640,Her Majesty doesn’t want to see me?
00:41:40.330,00:41:42.780,恳请姑姑再为我通传一次,00:41:41.565,00:41:44.200,"Madam, may I trouble you once more
to inform Her Majesty of my request?"
00:41:43.450,00:41:45.370,太后让奴婢转告贵人,00:41:44.605,00:41:46.640,"Her Majesty asked me to tell you,"
00:41:45.830,00:41:49.170,天寒地冻的 贵人头脑太热了,00:41:46.950,00:41:50.400,"My Lady, it’s freezing outside
but your mind has not cooled down."
00:41:49.670,00:41:52.160,可是莞嫔她是我自幼的姐妹啊,00:41:50.730,00:41:53.360,"But Concubine Sourire is my sister!
I grew up with her!"
00:41:52.800,00:41:54.460,太后说了不管是谁,00:41:53.870,00:41:55.640,"Her Majesty said that no matter who it is,"
00:41:54.800,00:41:57.340,自己头脑一热必定会做错事,00:41:55.700,00:41:58.290,you will do something wrong with an impulsive mind.
00:41:58.050,00:41:59.760,贵人在到寿康宫之前,00:41:59.125,00:42:01.000,"Before arriving at the Palace of Longevity,"
00:42:00.140,00:42:02.750,肯定先去过养心殿和景仁宫,00:42:01.180,00:42:03.880,"you must have visited the Hall of Mental Cultivation
and the Palace of Great Benevolence."
00:42:03.430,00:42:06.020,既然两宫都没有应承贵人的意思,00:42:04.560,00:42:07.160,"Since both palaces did not respond to your request,"
00:42:06.520,00:42:09.140,那太后也没有必要再见贵人您了,00:42:07.495,00:42:10.200,"there is no need for Her Majesty to see you, My Lady."
00:42:09.690,00:42:10.770,贵人请回吧,00:42:10.685,00:42:12.320,"My Lady, please take your leave."
00:42:15.110,00:42:15.820,姑,00:42:16.205,00:42:17.120,Madam…

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:58.999,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:18.999,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.000,00:43:35.999,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"
