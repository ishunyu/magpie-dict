00:02:23.240,00:02:23.870,他没有来,00:02:24.311,00:02:25.597,He didn't come.
00:02:27.200,00:02:29.350,小主是说果郡王吗,00:02:28.740,00:02:31.031,"My Lady, are you talking about Noble Prince Guo?"
00:02:31.000,00:02:31.670,都怪我傻,,,
00:02:33.760,00:02:35.030,人家堂堂一个王爷,00:02:31.786,00:02:33.530,I'm so foolish.
00:02:36.600,00:02:38.950,大雨天的不在王府里赏雨吟诗,00:02:35.404,00:02:40.000,"Why would a Noble Prince like him come out
on such a rainy day?"
00:02:39.480,00:02:40.750,好端端的跑来这里做什么,00:02:40.292,00:02:43.000,He must be reciting poems now in his estate.
00:02:42.640,00:02:43.950,他当日只是一句戏语,,,
00:02:44.880,00:02:45.630,我却当真了,00:02:43.830,00:02:45.680,He spoke in jest
,,,00:02:46.019,00:02:47.755,but I took him seriously.
00:02:48.320,00:02:51.030,或许他是真心邀小主的,00:02:49.460,00:02:52.281,Perhaps he was being sincere
00:02:51.720,00:02:52.990,只不过碍于天气,,,
00:02:53.440,00:02:54.580,不方便进宫罢了,00:02:52.696,00:02:56.045,but the rain made it inconvenient to come to the palace.
00:02:57.160,00:02:59.720,小主咱们回去吧,00:02:57.673,00:03:01.460,"We should go back, My Lady."
00:03:02.320,00:03:03.070,别淋着了,,,
00:03:03.640,00:03:04.230,走吧,00:03:03.398,00:03:04.998,Don't get wet.
00:03:10.320,00:03:11.990,如今后宫还安静吗,00:03:04.998,00:03:06.218,Let's go.
00:03:12.360,00:03:13.190,一切都好,00:03:11.318,00:03:13.431,Has the harem become more peaceful lately?
00:03:13.600,00:03:14.390,那就好,00:03:13.620,00:03:14.840,Everything is well.
,,,00:03:14.840,00:03:16.009,That's good.

of managing palace affairs."

00:03:27.760,00:03:28.630,是太后,00:03:28.829,00:03:30.339,"I will, Imperial Mother."
00:03:41.520,00:03:44.080,皇上 奴才刚才来看过,00:03:42.758,00:03:45.258,"Your Majesty, I came to check earlier."
00:03:44.440,00:03:45.470,这儿的确没人哪,00:03:45.560,00:03:47.089,No one was here.
00:03:47.840,00:03:51.750,下这么大雨 不来也是情理之中,00:03:49.200,00:03:53.119,"With such heavy rain,
I can understand why she didn't come."
00:03:52.560,00:03:53.270,皇上,,,
00:03:53.640,00:03:55.990,什么人都没您的身子要紧哪,00:03:53.609,00:03:57.200,Nothing matters as much as Your Majesty's health.
00:03:56.320,00:03:58.310,这里风大雨大咱们快回去吧,00:03:57.200,00:03:59.700,Please go back. The wind is getting stronger.
00:03:59.600,00:04:02.230,皇上 这两天您看折子看得晚,00:04:00.675,00:04:03.287,Your Majesty has been working late these days.
00:04:02.520,00:04:03.390,本就在咳嗽了,,,
00:04:03.720,00:04:04.590,要是着了寒,00:04:03.440,00:04:04.800,You already had a cough.
00:04:04.840,00:04:06.430,那可就是奴才的罪过了,00:04:04.800,00:04:07.760,I will be punished if Your Majesty catches a cold.
00:04:07.280,00:04:09.630,皇上 还是回去吧,00:04:08.476,00:04:11.097,"Your Majesty, please go."

00:04:40.040,00:04:40.910,没什么,00:04:41.000,00:04:42.360,Nothing.
00:04:45.880,00:04:47.470,向来琴声流露人心,00:04:47.040,00:04:49.636,The zither unveils the heart of the performer.
00:04:48.520,00:04:52.110,小主是心有所思 放不下什么吧,00:04:49.900,00:04:53.623,"My Lady, you have something on your mind
and cannot let it go."
00:04:57.200,00:04:59.710,他是郡王 小主是常在,00:04:58.280,00:05:01.200,"He is a Noble Prince, and you are a concubine."
00:05:01.520,00:05:02.830,恕奴婢多一句嘴,,,
00:05:03.600,00:05:06.430,小主今天不应该出去,00:05:02.774,00:05:07.674,"Forgive me, My Lady, but you shouldn't
have gone there today."
00:05:07.560,00:05:08.310,我知道,00:05:08.504,00:05:10.000,I know.
00:05:09.560,00:05:12.150,其实我只是一个幽居无宠的常在,00:05:10.550,00:05:13.563,"I'm just a secluded Attendant, without favor."
00:05:14.280,00:05:16.510,即使我连皇上长什么样都不知道,00:05:15.620,00:05:18.711,I haven't even seen the Emperor's face...
00:05:18.040,00:05:19.020,但我仍然,,,
00:05:20.280,00:05:22.190,不会和果郡王有什么关系,00:05:19.126,00:05:23.760,But I still won't have any relations with Noble Prince Guo.
00:05:23.080,00:05:25.430,小主入了宫便是皇上的人了,00:05:24.062,00:05:27.159,"You are His Majesty's concubine, My Lady."
00:05:26.080,00:05:28.150,可那人偏是皇上的弟弟,00:05:27.385,00:05:30.000,And he is His Majesty's brother.
00:05:29.160,00:05:30.710,万一有什么风言风语,,,
00:05:31.080,00:05:32.060,他倒没什么,00:05:30.226,00:05:32.105,"If rumors are whispered in the wind,"
00:05:32.680,00:05:34.980,吃亏的可是小主,00:05:32.105,00:05:36.038,"he won't be affected, but you will suffer, My Lady."
00:05:36.920,00:05:37.670,我知道,00:05:38.000,00:05:39.320,I know.
00:05:41.640,00:05:42.350,姐姐,00:05:43.040,00:05:44.151,Sourire.
00:05:44.200,00:05:46.790,雨刚停就过来看我 也不怕路滑,00:05:45.346,00:05:46.900,You came right after the rain stopped
,,,00:05:46.900,00:05:48.199,even though the road must be slippery.
00:05:48.600,00:05:51.310,皇上病了 我是不必侍疾的,00:05:49.736,00:05:52.536,"His Majesty got sick, but I don't need to attend to him."
00:05:51.840,00:05:54.190,若不来看姐姐 就更闲得慌了,00:05:53.026,00:05:55.374,"If I didn't come here, what would I do?"
00:05:54.480,00:05:55.790,眉姐姐去侍疾了,00:05:55.600,00:05:57.300,Meizhuang is there.
00:05:56.480,00:05:59.270,她准得碰见华妃 真是为难她,00:05:57.677,00:06:01.017,"It must be hard for her
to serve alongside Consort Fleur."
00:06:00.560,00:06:01.350,喝口茶吧,,,
00:06:01.880,00:06:02.510,好,00:06:01.774,00:06:03.057,Have some tea.
,,,00:06:03.246,00:06:04.067,All right.
00:06:05.120,00:06:07.500,皇上这病说来也奇怪,00:06:06.236,00:06:08.876,It's so strange that His Majesty fell ill.
00:06:07.760,00:06:10.140,好好的怎么就得了风寒了,00:06:09.140,00:06:11.540,How could he have gotten a cold?
00:06:10.800,00:06:13.310,是人总有身子骨不舒服的时候,00:06:11.800,00:06:14.673,Everyone can feel under the weather.
00:06:17.880,00:06:19.750,皇上药好了,00:06:19.200,00:06:21.660,"Your Majesty, the medicine is ready."
00:06:20.760,00:06:21.590,拿来朕喝,00:06:22.075,00:06:23.087,Bring it to me.
00:06:25.920,00:06:27.990,还是臣妾伺候皇上喝药吧,00:06:27.036,00:06:29.236,Let me serve it to Your Majesty.
00:06:38.640,00:06:39.670,你昨儿守了一夜,,,
00:06:40.680,00:06:41.820,早点回去歇息吧,00:06:40.000,00:06:41.589,You were here the whole night.
00:06:42.520,00:06:44.230,臣妾侍奉皇上惯了,00:06:41.815,00:06:43.415,You should go get some rest.
00:06:44.760,00:06:47.030,换别人在这儿守着反而不放心,00:06:43.826,00:06:45.772,I'm so used to serving Your Majesty
00:06:49.600,00:06:51.550,眉庄做事一向稳妥,00:06:45.999,00:06:48.319,I couldn't rest assured if it was anyone else.
00:06:52.400,00:06:53.620,话是这么说,00:06:50.914,00:06:52.986,Meizhuang is a reliable person.
00:06:54.040,00:06:56.630,可沈贵人毕竟是皇上身边的新人,00:06:53.684,00:06:57.620,"She is, but she is new to the harem."
00:06:57.600,00:07:00.270,有的时候毛手毛脚的也是难免的,00:06:58.840,00:07:01.336,She can be clumsy and careless sometimes.
00:07:06.280,00:07:08.190,小主 采月姑娘来了,00:07:07.634,00:07:09.518,"My Lady, Lunar is here."
00:07:09.240,00:07:10.190,莞常在吉祥,,,
00:07:10.480,00:07:11.190,我们贵人说,00:07:10.100,00:07:11.860,Peace to Attendant Sourire.
00:07:11.400,00:07:13.190,内务府新进了一些春日的绸缎,,,
00:07:13.400,00:07:14.670,请小主一同过去挑选,00:07:11.860,00:07:15.584,"The Household Department has obtained some
spring textiles. Please join Lady Shen in selecting them."
00:07:14.960,00:07:16.550,你们小主今日怎么得闲了,,,
00:07:17.120,00:07:18.510,不是说皇上龙体欠安,00:07:15.900,00:07:18.140,Why does she have spare time today?
00:07:18.720,00:07:19.590,去侍疾了吗,00:07:18.442,00:07:20.796,I thought she was tending to His Majesty.
00:07:20.040,00:07:21.020,如今皇上康复了,,,
00:07:21.720,00:07:22.390,正是呢,00:07:21.060,00:07:22.640,Is His Majesty well now?
00:07:22.680,00:07:23.230,从前儿夜里,,,
00:07:23.560,00:07:25.030,我们小主就不用侍疾了,00:07:22.904,00:07:26.369,Yes. Lady Shen hasn't had to go for the last two nights.
00:07:26.200,00:07:30.230,春光如许 朕倒有些辜负了,00:07:27.531,00:07:31.351,"The spring scenery has arrived.
I regret to be remiss about it."
00:07:31.240,00:07:33.310,正是因为皇上贪爱春色,00:07:32.400,00:07:34.440,"It was precisely because Your Majesty indulged
in springtime beauty"
00:07:33.520,00:07:35.510,才会在御花园着了风寒,00:07:34.440,00:07:37.400, that you caught a cold in the Imperial Garden.
00:07:36.280,00:07:40.550,听太后念叨御花园里的花儿朵儿,00:07:37.425,00:07:41.755,"The Empress Dowager was talking about spring flowers
in the Imperial Garden."
00:07:41.840,00:07:43.470,本想尽点孝心,00:07:43.023,00:07:45.314,I was hoping to be a devoted son
00:07:45.000,00:07:47.950,到花园里亲自去给太后,,,
00:07:48.160,00:07:49.670,选些好看的花,00:07:46.282,00:07:50.775,by personally picking some beautiful flowers.
00:07:50.920,00:07:55.310,谁知春雨含潮 竟伤风了,00:07:52.280,00:07:56.491,"Who could have known that I'd catch a cold
 from the dampness of the spring rain?"
00:07:55.520,00:07:58.390,知道的呢 是说皇上您的孝心,00:07:56.680,00:07:59.634,"We know Your Majesty was being a devoted son,"
00:07:58.600,00:07:59.390,不知道的,,,
00:07:59.600,00:08:02.230,还以为御花园的花儿朵儿成了精,,,
00:08:02.480,00:08:03.750,勾了皇上去呢,00:07:59.860,00:08:05.000,"but the ignorant might say that
the wicked garden flowers captured your heart."
00:08:04.480,00:08:06.190,这话就数你小气,00:08:05.664,00:08:07.886,Not as wicked as the green-eyed monster.
00:08:07.120,00:08:09.470,读书不多顶嘴倒快,00:08:08.317,00:08:11.135,"You don't read much, but you're quick to argue."
00:08:10.880,00:08:13.790,好了这些日子你也累了,00:08:12.124,00:08:14.804,"All right, you've been tired lately."
00:08:14.040,00:08:15.070,早点回去歇息吧,,,
00:08:15.920,00:08:16.870,是,00:08:15.071,00:08:16.380,Go back and have some rest.
00:08:17.440,00:08:18.660,皇上刚下早朝,00:08:16.914,00:08:18.003,Yes.
00:08:19.040,00:08:20.390,臣妾命他们熬了药,00:08:18.611,00:08:21.630,"As soon as Your Majesty came back from court,
I asked for medicine to be prepared."
00:08:20.600,00:08:22.630,皇上喝完药再看折子吧,00:08:21.630,00:08:23.781,Please take it before you read the memorandums.
00:08:35.000,00:08:35.670,苏培盛,,,
00:08:37.200,00:08:37.910,奴才在,00:08:36.160,00:08:37.707,Su Peisheng.
00:08:38.240,00:08:39.190,陪朕出去走走,00:08:38.160,00:08:39.500,Your Majesty.
00:08:39.760,00:08:40.390,嗻,00:08:39.500,00:08:41.135,Go on a walk with me.
00:08:42.720,00:08:44.870,先给朕换身常服,00:08:43.861,00:08:46.161,"Wait, get me my casual clothing."
00:08:45.320,00:08:45.910,嗻,,,
00:08:57.560,00:08:58.350,又是她,,,
00:08:59.360,00:09:00.630,什么人在秋千上,00:08:58.800,00:09:00.000,It's her again.
00:09:01.080,00:09:02.870,怎么见了咱们小主还不过来,00:09:00.446,00:09:02.037,Who is it on the swing?
,,,00:09:02.188,00:09:04.217,Why are you not coming to greet My Lady?
00:09:04.640,00:09:06.190,还不过来啊说的就是你,00:09:05.554,00:09:08.162,Come here! I'm talking to you!
00:09:07.480,00:09:10.270,我家小主是碎玉轩莞常在,00:09:08.600,00:09:11.554,My Lady is Attendant Sourire of the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:09:11.320,00:09:13.070,哪有穿得这么素净的常在呀,00:09:12.370,00:09:14.550,She doesn't dress like an Attendant.
00:09:17.360,00:09:18.870,宫中有莞常在吗,00:09:18.533,00:09:20.267,Is there an Attendant Sourire in the harem?
00:09:19.280,00:09:20.750,我可从来没有听说过,00:09:20.267,00:09:22.080,I've never heard of her.
00:09:21.200,00:09:23.830,小主 碎玉轩的确住着位常在,00:09:22.490,00:09:25.124,"My Lady, there is indeed an Attendant in
the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:09:24.040,00:09:25.790,只是得了顽疾 甚少出门,00:09:25.275,00:09:27.502,But she was sick and put into a quarantine.
00:09:30.800,00:09:33.430,答应余氏见过莞常在,00:09:32.066,00:09:34.861,"Greetings, Attendant Sourire.
I'm Companion Yu."
00:09:34.040,00:09:34.950,余答应好,,,
00:09:36.120,00:09:38.030,怎么这般有雅兴出来走走,00:09:35.200,00:09:36.862,"Greetings, Companion Yu."
00:09:39.280,00:09:40.470,我要服侍皇上,00:09:37.202,00:09:39.780,How come you fancy going on a walk out here?
00:09:41.040,00:09:42.950,哪像莞常在这么休闲自在,00:09:40.277,00:09:44.433,"I've been busy serving His Majesty.
How could I be as leisurely as you?"
00:09:43.880,00:09:47.230,不过有句话我要奉劝莞常在,00:09:45.121,00:09:48.421,"But I will offer my advice to you, Attendant Sourire."
00:09:48.040,00:09:50.790,要是姐姐身患顽疾就不要出来,00:09:49.264,00:09:51.907,"Since you're sick, you should stay in your palace."
00:09:51.640,00:09:55.150,免得让人沾了晦气 平白招人嫌,00:09:52.813,00:09:56.560,"Otherwise, you'll spread your bad luck to the palace."
00:09:55.720,00:09:56.990,多谢余答应提醒,00:09:56.749,00:09:58.532,Thank you for the reminder.
00:09:58.120,00:10:00.390,不过我也有一事要告诉余答应,00:09:59.249,00:10:01.720,But there's something I need to tell you as well.
00:10:02.240,00:10:04.230,不知莞常在有何高见,00:10:02.022,00:10:05.676,Is that so? I'd very much like to hear it.
00:10:05.360,00:10:08.390,听闻皇上向来喜欢礼仪周全之人,00:10:06.468,00:10:09.656,I've heard that His Majesty likes well-mannered concubines.
00:10:09.080,00:10:10.790,可是刚才余答应见到我,,,
00:10:11.440,00:10:12.710,并未向我行大礼,00:10:10.260,00:10:14.276,But you did not bow to me properly when you saw me.
00:10:13.960,00:10:15.950,可见是对宫中礼仪还不熟悉,00:10:15.116,00:10:17.581,You must be unfamiliar with the etiquette in the palace.
00:10:17.400,00:10:18.310,不如这样,,,
00:10:18.640,00:10:20.070,我让侍女示范一次,00:10:18.548,00:10:21.608,How about my maid shows you how to do it properly?
00:10:20.640,00:10:22.350,也好叫答应好好学学,,,
00:10:22.800,00:10:23.550,是,00:10:21.920,00:10:23.720,You can watch and learn.
00:10:25.800,00:10:26.750,请答应看看,00:10:23.909,00:10:24.800,Yes.
00:10:28.840,00:10:30.750,答应余氏见过莞常在,00:10:26.688,00:10:28.349,"Companion Yu, please watch."
00:10:31.040,00:10:32.750,莞常在万福金安,00:10:30.000,00:10:34.013,"Companion Yu bows before Attendant Sourire.
Peace and grace to Attendant Sourire."
00:10:33.800,00:10:35.910,常听宫中姐妹夸余答应聪明,,,
00:10:36.200,00:10:36.950,一学就会,00:10:34.890,00:10:38.136,Other concubines have praised you for being a fast learner.
00:10:37.880,00:10:38.750,那就请答应,,,
00:10:39.000,00:10:40.670,按照刚才流朱所示范的,,,
00:10:41.000,00:10:42.140,再向我行次礼吧,00:10:38.853,00:10:43.247,"I believe you can follow Vermillion's demonstration
and do it properly now."
00:10:43.320,00:10:45.470,你只不过是一个入宫无宠的常在,00:10:44.454,00:10:46.780,"You're just an Attendant, with no favor."
00:10:46.400,00:10:47.430,竟敢让本小主,,,
00:10:47.680,00:10:50.310,恭恭敬敬地向你行礼 你也配,00:10:47.315,00:10:50.433,You want me to bow before you like that?
00:10:51.160,00:10:53.150,小主 莞常在的位分,00:10:50.700,00:10:51.900,How dare you?
00:10:53.480,00:10:55.270,的确在你之上 小主,00:10:52.239,00:10:55.748,"My Lady, Attendant Sourire does rank above you ..."
00:10:56.320,00:10:57.750,你这个吃里扒外的东西,00:10:55.748,00:10:56.689,My Lady ...
00:11:00.760,00:11:03.140,莞常在不会真的以为,00:10:57.368,00:10:59.179,Do you not know who your mistress is?
00:11:03.600,00:11:06.110,论自己的位分就能定尊卑吧,00:11:01.913,00:11:07.391,"Attendant Sourire, do you really believe that your status
in the palace is determined by your rank?"
00:11:07.320,00:11:10.150,皇上宠谁 谁的位分就高,00:11:08.426,00:11:11.552,You'll rank higher if His Majesty favors you.
00:11:11.000,00:11:12.990,否则位分再高,,,
00:11:13.240,00:11:15.150,那也只不过是卑贱之躯,00:11:12.231,00:11:16.304,"Otherwise, you're just a lowly servant,
regardless of your title."
00:11:15.720,00:11:18.070,更何况你的位分,00:11:16.811,00:11:18.311,"Besides,"
00:11:18.600,00:11:19.820,只不过是比我高出了,,,
00:11:20.120,00:11:21.430,那么一点点而已,00:11:18.311,00:11:22.056,you are merely one rank above me.
00:11:21.720,00:11:23.270,你凭什么敢指使我,00:11:22.679,00:11:24.644,How dare you tell me what to do?
00:11:24.480,00:11:26.190,如果是朕指使的,00:11:25.500,00:11:27.680,What if I told you what to do?
00:11:28.280,00:11:31.030,要你向莞常在行礼参拜呢,00:11:29.573,00:11:32.301,What if I made you bow to Attendant Sourire?
00:11:31.720,00:11:32.630,皇上吉祥,00:11:32.716,00:11:34.273,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:11:38.360,00:11:40.390,皇上 您怎么来这儿了,00:11:39.450,00:11:41.730,What has brought Your Majesty here?
00:11:41.000,00:11:42.510,那你怎么来这儿了,00:11:42.244,00:11:44.035,And what brought you here?
00:11:44.280,00:11:47.230,臣妾听说皇上最近喜欢来御花园,00:11:45.439,00:11:48.513,"I heard that Your Majesty has been
coming to the garden a lot recently."
00:11:47.560,00:11:49.270,想必这里景色一定很美,,,
00:11:49.600,00:11:51.590,所以臣妾也过来逛逛,00:11:48.780,00:11:52.736,"I thought the garden must be beautiful,
so I came here for a walk."
00:11:51.800,00:11:53.270,这话说得不老实,00:11:52.914,00:11:54.678,You are not being honest.
00:11:55.800,00:11:59.070,臣妾只是想随时陪伴皇上身边,00:11:56.977,00:12:00.000,I was simply hoping to keep Your Majesty company.
00:11:59.560,00:12:01.990,怎么你对朕的行踪很清楚,00:12:00.669,00:12:03.366,How come you know so much about my whereabouts?
00:12:08.240,00:12:09.910,小主 小主,00:12:09.266,00:12:11.186,My Lady... My Lady...
00:12:13.000,00:12:16.150,参见皇上 皇上万福金安,00:12:13.899,00:12:15.408,I bow before Your Majesty.
00:12:16.560,00:12:17.620,皇上万福金安,00:12:16.049,00:12:17.480,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:12:18.400,00:12:19.230,朕,00:12:17.573,00:12:19.193,Peace and Grace to Your Majesty.
,,,00:12:19.460,00:12:20.835,That day
00:12:20.320,00:12:23.110,那日并非故意爽约迟来,00:12:21.363,00:12:24.683,I didn't mean to break my promise.
00:12:24.920,00:12:27.030,这几日朕虽然病着,,,
00:12:27.480,00:12:29.150,心却惦记着你这里,00:12:26.068,00:12:30.000,"Although I've been ill,
my heart has been with you at this place."
00:12:29.920,00:12:32.070,你可有再来等朕吗,00:12:31.064,00:12:33.704,Did you come here and wait for me afterwards?
00:12:36.520,00:12:37.310,起来吧,00:12:37.480,00:12:38.940,Rise.
00:12:38.440,00:12:40.510,扶好你家小主 她身子弱,00:12:39.581,00:12:42.060,Hold on to your mistress. She's delicate.
00:12:41.440,00:12:42.270,小主,00:12:42.526,00:12:43.813,My Lady.
00:12:44.440,00:12:46.740,你这老毛病没改,00:12:45.597,00:12:47.917,You still haven't learned your lesson!
00:12:47.240,00:12:49.990,看来太后上次对你的责罚太轻了,00:12:48.329,00:12:51.560,"It seems that punishment
by the Empress Dowager was too lenient."
00:12:50.960,00:12:52.910,皇上 臣妾知错了,00:12:52.039,00:12:54.300,"Your Majesty, I admit my fault."
00:12:53.760,00:12:55.430,臣妾只是今日蒙了心,,,
00:12:55.680,00:12:57.110,才冲撞莞常在的,00:12:54.790,00:12:58.360,"My mind was clouded
and I offended Attendant Sourire."
00:12:57.480,00:13:00.430,要不 要不臣妾向莞常在请罪吧,00:12:58.549,00:13:01.700,I will... I will beg Attendant Sourire for her forgiveness.
00:13:00.640,00:13:02.310,请皇上饶了臣妾这一回吧,00:13:01.889,00:13:04.000,"Please spare me this time, Your Majesty!"
00:13:09.240,00:13:10.990,妹妹今日犯下滔天大错,,,
00:13:11.640,00:13:13.150,不敢请求莞常在原谅,00:13:10.362,00:13:14.520,I am unworthy of your forgiveness for my grave offense.
00:13:14.160,00:13:14.990,还请常在,,,
00:13:15.520,00:13:17.510,看在咱们一同服侍皇上的份上,,,
00:13:17.840,00:13:19.110,求皇上饶了我吧,00:13:15.328,00:13:20.598,"Please remember that we both serve His Majesty,
and seek His Majesty's leniency for me."
00:13:24.960,00:13:28.150,皇上 知错能改 善莫大焉,00:13:25.991,00:13:26.868,Your Majesty.
,,,00:13:27.281,00:13:29.738,"""A fault confessed is half-redressed."""
00:13:28.960,00:13:31.950,臣妾想余答应是真心知错了,00:13:30.040,00:13:33.440,I believe Companion Yu is sincerely addressing her mistake.
00:13:33.000,00:13:34.060,还请皇上宽恕,00:13:34.160,00:13:35.908,I hope Your Majesty can show mercy.
00:13:34.880,00:13:38.150,既然莞常在替你求情了,00:13:36.189,00:13:39.229,"Since Attendant Sourire interceded for you,"
00:13:39.000,00:13:41.300,朕也不好太拂她的面子,00:13:40.151,00:13:42.928,I shall not slight her feelings.
00:13:43.360,00:13:45.510,只是你屡教不改 实在可恶,00:13:44.539,00:13:46.970,But I detest your repeated misconduct.
00:13:46.880,00:13:47.550,苏培盛,00:13:48.000,00:13:49.231,Su Peisheng.
00:13:51.320,00:13:51.950,奴才在,00:13:52.408,00:13:53.373,Your Majesty.
00:13:52.200,00:13:55.150,记着 降余氏为官女子,00:13:53.400,00:13:56.317,Yu is demoted to Escort.
00:13:55.840,00:13:57.110,迁出钟粹宫,,,
00:13:57.600,00:13:59.790,住到朕看不见的地方去,00:13:56.988,00:14:00.960,"She will move out of the Palace of Accumulated Purity,
to a place I can't see."
00:14:00.400,00:14:00.990,嗻,,,
00:14:01.920,00:14:02.590,皇上,00:14:01.405,00:14:02.425,Yes.
00:14:02.800,00:14:03.670,你刚才不是说,00:14:03.000,00:14:04.016,Your Majesty...
00:14:04.360,00:14:06.820,莞常在的位分只比你高了一点吗,00:14:04.016,00:14:08.300,"You were saying that Attendant Sourire
was only one rank above you."
00:14:07.600,00:14:11.270,朕就晋莞常在为贵人,00:14:08.866,00:14:12.551,I hereby promote Attendant Sourire to Noble Lady.
00:14:12.200,00:14:15.110,皇上 莞常在尚未侍寝就晋封,00:14:13.419,00:14:16.380,"Your Majesty, I'm afraid
it's inappropriate to promote Attendant Sourire"
00:14:15.440,00:14:16.710,恐怕不合规矩,00:14:16.380,00:14:17.794,since she hasn't served you...
00:14:16.960,00:14:19.310,你如今的差事当得是越发好了,00:14:17.794,00:14:20.160,You've become so masterful in your service.
00:14:19.560,00:14:21.310,朕的旨意都要过问,00:14:20.727,00:14:22.600,You dare to question my decrees?
00:14:21.920,00:14:22.710,奴才不敢,,,
00:14:23.520,00:14:24.740,奴才这就去传旨,00:14:22.998,00:14:24.224,I would not dare.
00:14:27.080,00:14:28.830,怎么高兴得过了头了,00:14:24.563,00:14:26.521,I will announce Your Majesty's edict right away.
00:14:29.040,00:14:30.180,连谢恩都忘了,00:14:28.295,00:14:31.426,"Are you so overjoyed
that you've forgotten to thank me?"
00:14:33.480,00:14:35.940,臣妾一与社稷无功,00:14:34.700,00:14:35.836,"Your Majesty,"
00:14:36.560,00:14:37.590,二与龙脉无助,00:14:35.987,00:14:39.176,"I have made no contribution
to either state affairs or family expansion."
00:14:38.360,00:14:41.150,实在 不敢领受皇上天恩,00:14:39.365,00:14:42.385,I do not deserve Your Majesty's heavenly grace.
00:14:41.760,00:14:44.630,朕说你当得起 你就必然当得起,00:14:42.875,00:14:45.525,You deserve it if I say so.
00:14:45.040,00:14:47.150,起来吧 动不动就跪,00:14:45.903,00:14:47.049,Rise.
00:14:47.480,00:14:48.750,也不怕累着自个儿,00:14:47.351,00:14:50.182,Don't tire yourself out by kneeling so much.
00:14:52.880,00:14:55.340,余小主 您请回吧,00:14:53.974,00:14:56.800,"Escort Yu, please take your leave."
00:15:02.480,00:15:03.390,臣妾告退,00:15:03.644,00:15:05.044,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:15:22.480,00:15:23.790,怎么 怕了,00:15:23.733,00:15:25.520,Are you scared?
00:15:43.800,00:15:46.950,手心冒汗 你心慌啊,00:15:45.198,00:15:47.840,There's sweat on your hands. Are you nervous?
00:15:55.400,00:15:56.190,您是皇上,00:15:56.513,00:15:58.093,You are the Emperor.
00:15:57.560,00:16:00.230,从前不怕 你胆子大,00:15:58.662,00:16:00.240,You weren't afraid of me before.
,,,00:16:00.705,00:16:01.988,You were fearless.
00:16:02.200,00:16:05.390,从前不知是皇上如今知道了,00:16:03.359,00:16:06.873,"I didn't know you were the Emperor, but now I do."
00:16:06.840,00:16:08.060,天子君临四方,,,
00:16:08.960,00:16:11.590,臣妾小小女子 不能不怕,00:16:08.000,00:16:13.005,"The Son of Heaven carries authority
and inspires awe in my humble being."
00:16:12.840,00:16:13.820,怕了就拘束,,,
00:16:14.800,00:16:16.830,拘束了就成了君臣,00:16:13.835,00:16:18.407,"Awe leads to inhibition,
and that will turn us into monarch and subject."
00:16:18.320,00:16:21.390,那日大雨 朕并非故意爽约,00:16:19.453,00:16:22.919,"I didn't mean to let you down that day, in the heavy rain."
00:16:22.240,00:16:24.750,朕还差几步就进御花园了,00:16:23.560,00:16:26.560,I was a few steps away from the garden
00:16:25.600,00:16:29.380,结果太后要朕去寿康宫,00:16:26.679,00:16:31.080,but the Empress Dowager summoned me.
00:16:30.720,00:16:32.510,等朕再来御花园,,,
00:16:32.880,00:16:34.990,却是佳人已不见,00:16:31.815,00:16:33.870,I hurried back to the garden
00:16:35.360,00:16:36.870,还受了几日风寒,00:16:34.096,00:16:36.640,only to miss your beautiful presence.
00:16:37.600,00:16:38.820,皇上身子可好了,00:16:36.640,00:16:38.550,"Instead, I had a cold for days."
00:16:39.560,00:16:42.070,朕现在不是好端端地站在你面前,00:16:38.701,00:16:40.346,Has Your Majesty recovered?
00:16:42.400,00:16:44.470,跟你说话吗 是不是,00:16:40.723,00:16:45.840,I am talking to you here - as right as rain.
00:16:45.520,00:16:46.500,臣妾愚钝,,,
00:16:47.440,00:16:48.470,关心则乱,00:16:46.490,00:16:48.040,It was foolish of me.
,,,00:16:48.530,00:16:50.244,Because you care.
00:16:51.000,00:16:53.630,朕后来想 那日雨那么大,00:16:52.221,00:16:53.480,"Later, I thought"
00:16:54.120,00:16:55.340,你一直在静养,00:16:53.818,00:16:56.686,you couldn't have come.
00:16:56.920,00:16:58.270,定是来不了了,00:16:57.893,00:17:00.339,You were recuperating and it was raining badly.
00:17:00.000,00:17:03.230,其实那日臣妾并没有爽约,00:17:01.101,00:17:04.480,"In fact, I came to the garden as promised."
00:17:03.880,00:17:04.630,果真吗,00:17:04.900,00:17:06.000,Really?
00:17:05.560,00:17:07.990,那你可淋了雨 有没有伤着身子,00:17:06.606,00:17:09.391,"Were you caught in the rain?
Did that affect your health?"
00:17:08.760,00:17:09.950,多谢皇上关怀,00:17:09.769,00:17:11.503,I thank Your Majesty for asking.
00:17:11.240,00:17:14.270,臣妾也好端端地站在皇上面前了,00:17:12.391,00:17:15.735,I am standing here - as right as rain.
00:17:16.240,00:17:16.950,那就好,00:17:17.154,00:17:18.234,That's good.
00:17:18.560,00:17:21.270,朕只想你入宫一直病着,,,
00:17:21.520,00:17:22.830,身子格外弱些,00:17:19.608,00:17:24.003,"I was concerned about your health
since you have been unwell."
00:17:23.800,00:17:27.910,皇上 如何欺瞒臣妾,00:17:24.944,00:17:29.226,But why... would Your Majesty deceive me?
00:17:28.360,00:17:29.230,不是欺瞒,,,
00:17:30.320,00:17:31.590,朕只是不愿意,00:17:29.452,00:17:31.040,It was not deception.
00:17:32.880,00:17:35.670,不愿意让你因为朕的身份怕朕,00:17:31.453,00:17:33.379,I simply did not want you
00:17:36.320,00:17:38.990,顺从朕 献媚于朕,00:17:34.095,00:17:40.000,"to be afraid, or submissive, or fawning,
because of who I was."
00:17:39.520,00:17:42.910,更不愿意因此而成个孤家寡人,,,
00:17:43.400,00:17:45.310,连个说知心话的人都没有,00:17:40.666,00:17:46.103,"I do not wish to end up alone in the palace,
with no one to confide in."
00:17:46.640,00:17:48.830,臣妾与皇上相识未深,,,
00:17:49.560,00:17:51.350,不敢称是皇上的知心人,00:17:48.060,00:17:52.820,"I barely know Your Majesty.
I dare not see myself as Your Majesty's confidante."
00:17:52.680,00:17:56.030,朕看重你也就是因为你的本性,00:17:53.801,00:17:57.474,I appreciate you for who you are.
00:17:57.000,00:17:58.950,如果你与她们并无两样,,,
00:17:59.840,00:18:02.510,朕也不会如此重视与你的约定,00:17:58.115,00:18:03.335,"I wouldn't have taken our meeting
so seriously if you were like the other concubines."
00:18:04.320,00:18:07.910,臣妾愚钝 竟一点都没看出来,00:18:05.541,00:18:09.499,I'm dull-witted for not discovering your identity.
00:18:09.360,00:18:12.190,朕存心瞒你 怎能让你知道,00:18:10.366,00:18:13.977,How could you have known if I deliberately hid it from you?
00:18:13.560,00:18:15.190,只是苦了十七弟,00:18:14.845,00:18:16.720,But my seventeeth brother is bitter about this.
00:18:15.640,00:18:17.870,常被朕召进宫拘着,00:18:16.757,00:18:19.241,He's often been confined in my palace lately.
00:18:19.600,00:18:23.070,皇上心思缜密 臣妾如何知晓,00:18:20.599,00:18:24.547,"Your Majesty planned it thoughtfully.
I wouldn't have known."
00:18:29.280,00:18:30.390,怎么手这么凉,00:18:30.410,00:18:31.840,Your hands are cold.
00:18:31.640,00:18:34.020,是吹了风的缘故,00:18:32.920,00:18:35.570,Is it because you've been standing in the wind?
00:18:35.200,00:18:36.110,臣妾不冷,,,
00:18:36.920,00:18:38.510,你出来时间也久了,00:18:36.060,00:18:37.681,I'm not cold.
00:18:39.040,00:18:40.020,朕月关陪你回去吧,00:18:37.920,00:18:41.306,"You've been outside for quite a while.
I'll walk you back."
00:18:41.520,00:18:44.030,步行劳累 朕抱你回去,00:18:42.640,00:18:44.040,"No, you must be tired."
00:18:44.440,00:18:45.270,臣妾不敢,00:18:44.040,00:18:45.285,I'll carry you in my arms.
,,,00:18:45.587,00:18:46.956,I would not dare.
00:18:48.400,00:18:49.310,为什么不敢,00:18:49.500,00:18:50.907,Why not?
00:18:50.360,00:18:52.390,别人会议论皇上的,00:18:51.541,00:18:53.740,Your Majesty will become the subject of gossip.
00:18:54.440,00:18:56.900,朕心疼自己喜欢的女子,00:18:55.564,00:18:58.344,I'm taking care of a lady I'm fond of.
00:18:57.640,00:19:00.550,别人爱怎么议论就怎么议论,00:18:58.721,00:19:01.826,Let them gossip all they want.

00:19:41.840,00:19:44.910,皇上万福 莞贵人吉祥,00:19:43.110,00:19:46.052,"Peace to Your Majesty.
Peace to Noble Lady Sourire."
00:19:45.080,00:19:46.390,你们的消息倒灵通,,,
00:19:47.200,00:19:48.390,皇上恩赏小主,00:19:46.240,00:19:47.800,You're already well-informed.
00:19:48.640,00:19:49.910,就是恩赏碎玉轩上下,00:19:48.276,00:19:51.300,"The Palace of Pearl Jade is honored
by Your Majesty's grace to My Lady."
00:19:50.200,00:19:52.030,奴婢们同沐皇上恩德,,,
00:19:52.520,00:19:53.310,都起来吧,00:19:51.300,00:19:53.500,We all are grateful to Your Majesty.
00:19:53.640,00:19:54.510,谢皇上,00:19:53.560,00:19:54.760,All rise.
00:19:54.800,00:19:57.030,你很好 话也灵透 叫什么,00:19:54.760,00:19:56.000,I thank Your Majesty.
00:19:57.440,00:19:59.670,奴婢流朱 是小主的陪嫁丫头,00:19:56.000,00:19:58.520,"You are clever and articulate.
What's your name?"
,,,00:19:58.560,00:20:01.166,"Your Majesty, my name is Vermilion.
I am My Lady's dowry maid."
00:20:00.600,00:20:03.710,果然是有其主必有其仆,00:20:02.000,00:20:04.876,"Like master, like servant."
00:20:05.840,00:20:06.790,谢皇上夸奖,00:20:07.016,00:20:08.416,I thank Your Majesty.
00:20:21.360,00:20:22.670,朕的手都酸了,00:20:22.600,00:20:24.200,My arms are sore.
00:20:23.840,00:20:26.110,皇上是嫌臣妾重吗,00:20:25.220,00:20:27.531,Does Your Majesty think I am too heavy?
00:20:26.880,00:20:31.110,你倒不重 是朕抱紧了怕你痛,00:20:27.946,00:20:29.278,Not at all.
,,,00:20:29.768,00:20:32.400,I was afraid I would hurt you if I held too tightly
00:20:31.760,00:20:33.710,抱松了怕你摔着,00:20:32.850,00:20:35.170,or you'd fall if I loosened my grip.
00:20:34.560,00:20:37.910,一双手进退为难 所以才酸了,00:20:35.660,00:20:39.155,"My arms were in a conundrum, and ended up feeling sore."
00:20:39.120,00:20:40.670,皇上惯会取笑人的,00:20:40.000,00:20:41.953,Your Majesty is teasing me.
00:20:45.880,00:20:47.670,莞贵人做常在的时候,,,
00:20:47.920,00:20:49.190,就你们几个人伺候着,00:20:47.280,00:20:50.629,"Is Noble Lady Sourire being attended to by
such a small number of servants?"
00:20:49.560,00:20:50.310,是,,,
00:20:50.800,00:20:52.150,臣妾需要静养,00:20:50.629,00:20:51.393,Yes.
00:20:53.000,00:20:55.560,也实在不需要那么多奴才伺候,00:20:51.936,00:20:56.636,"I need a quiet environment.
There's no need for me to have many servants."
00:20:56.160,00:20:57.270,那也不像话,00:20:57.126,00:20:58.749,But this is unacceptable.
00:20:59.920,00:21:02.220,谁是这宫里的掌事宫女和太监,00:21:01.045,00:21:03.751,Who are the head eunuch and head maid?
00:21:02.880,00:21:03.710,回禀皇上,,,
00:21:04.120,00:21:06.990,奴婢崔槿汐是碎玉轩的掌事宫女,00:21:03.940,00:21:08.276,"Your Majesty, my name is Cui Jinxi.
I am the head maid of the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:21:07.640,00:21:10.100,碎玉轩无首领太监,00:21:08.804,00:21:11.578,There is currently no head eunuch in this palace.
00:21:10.440,00:21:12.230,原本的首领太监康禄海,,,
00:21:12.480,00:21:13.030,两个月前,,,
00:21:13.240,00:21:15.230,被丽嫔娘娘叫了去当差了,00:21:11.578,00:21:16.178,"The former head eunuch Kang Luhai was sent to
work for Concubine Beauté two months ago."
00:21:17.600,00:21:18.550,这是小事,00:21:18.860,00:21:20.260,That's all right.
00:21:20.440,00:21:23.110,你宫里没有个首领太监这不行,00:21:21.685,00:21:24.678,But you need a head eunuch in your palace.
00:21:23.640,00:21:24.390,朕明日,,,
00:21:24.600,00:21:26.510,让内务府给你选几个老成的,00:21:24.980,00:21:27.900,"I will ask the Household Department
to select a few skilled eunuchs for you tomorrow."
00:21:27.080,00:21:29.110,你挑一个在宫里管事,00:21:28.320,00:21:30.721,You will choose one as your head eunuch.
00:21:31.440,00:21:33.630,皇上关怀 臣妾心领了,00:21:32.519,00:21:34.880,I appreciate Your Majesty's offering.
00:21:34.800,00:21:36.590,其实也不必这样麻烦,00:21:35.866,00:21:38.420,But there's no need to go through so much trouble.
00:21:37.440,00:21:39.430,臣妾觉得小允子还行,00:21:38.720,00:21:40.856,I think Xiao-Yunzi is quite competent.
00:21:39.840,00:21:42.750,就让他先顶了这差使 历练历练,00:21:41.082,00:21:43.944,He can take on this role and gain some experience.
00:21:43.200,00:21:45.470,奴才谢皇上恩典 谢小主恩典,00:21:44.283,00:21:46.560,"I thank Your Majesty.
I thank My Lady."
00:21:45.800,00:21:47.990,奴才一定尽心竭力伺候好小主,00:21:46.760,00:21:49.220,I will do everything I can to serve My Lady.
00:21:49.600,00:21:52.110,行 你说好就好吧,00:21:50.756,00:21:53.376,"Of course, if that's what you wish."
00:21:53.240,00:21:54.590,省得外头调来的人,,,
00:21:54.880,00:21:55.990,摸不准你的脾性,00:21:54.357,00:21:57.309,The new eunuchs wouldn't know you as well.
00:21:59.520,00:22:00.870,你家小主赏识你,,,
00:22:01.160,00:22:02.140,你更得好好办事,00:22:00.700,00:22:03.491,"Lady Sourire appreciates your work.
You must do your job well."
00:22:02.360,00:22:03.470,是 奴才遵旨,00:22:03.491,00:22:04.656,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:22:06.480,00:22:09.110,你新晋了贵人 该多添几个人,00:22:07.685,00:22:10.645,"You've just been promoted.
You should have more servants."
00:22:09.960,00:22:12.670,朕明日让内务府给你挑几个好的,00:22:11.060,00:22:14.285,I'll ask the Household Department to bring you some good ones.
00:22:13.680,00:22:14.390,谢皇上,00:22:14.700,00:22:16.076,I thank Your Majesty.
00:22:17.800,00:22:18.550,启禀皇上,,,
00:22:19.280,00:22:21.110,张廷玉大人请旨求见,00:22:19.040,00:22:22.500,"Your Majesty, Mr. Zhang Tingyu requests an audience."
00:22:22.120,00:22:22.910,知道了,00:22:23.053,00:22:24.350,I see.
00:22:30.000,00:22:32.510,你早些歇息好好静养,00:22:31.025,00:22:33.645,Rest well and take care.
00:22:33.320,00:22:34.870,朕过两日再来看你,00:22:34.475,00:22:36.480,I'll come and see you in two days.
00:22:39.400,00:22:40.590,臣妾恭送皇上,00:22:40.315,00:22:42.080,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:22:49.320,00:22:50.830,本宫的规矩你知道,,,
00:22:51.680,00:22:53.630,奴婢知道娘娘您习字的时候,00:22:50.600,00:22:52.514,You know my rules.
00:22:53.880,00:22:54.750,不喜人打扰,00:22:52.740,00:22:54.780,I know that Your Majesty doesn't like to be disturbed
00:22:55.160,00:22:55.950,可是,00:22:54.780,00:22:56.426,"(Peace)
when you practice calligraphy."
00:22:56.480,00:22:59.230,余答应她被罚了 罚做官女子,00:22:56.426,00:23:00.542,"But I wanted to report that
Companion Yu has been punished and demoted to Escort."
00:23:00.400,00:23:01.540,是皇上的意思吗,,,
00:23:01.840,00:23:02.630,正是,00:23:01.456,00:23:02.876,By His Majesty?
00:23:03.480,00:23:05.990,情理之中 却比意料更快,00:23:03.140,00:23:04.231,Exactly.
00:23:06.640,00:23:08.230,找人看着她 不许她闹,00:23:04.646,00:23:07.480,"That was expected, but sooner than I imagined."
00:23:08.400,00:23:09.070,是,00:23:07.782,00:23:09.516,Make sure that she's behaving herself.
,,,00:23:09.516,00:23:10.231,Yes.
00:23:10.000,00:23:12.510,余氏轻浮 本不配伺候皇上,00:23:11.061,00:23:13.992,Yu is shallow. She doesn't deserve to serve His Majesty.
00:23:13.320,00:23:15.070,却还十分不知道检点,00:23:14.180,00:23:16.300,And yet she didn't care about proper demeanor.
00:23:15.360,00:23:16.500,如何不检点,00:23:16.300,00:23:17.760,What happened?
00:23:17.120,00:23:20.900,以下犯上 折辱碎玉轩的莞贵人,00:23:18.175,00:23:22.307,She offended Noble Lady Sourire of the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:23:22.760,00:23:24.070,这么快成贵人了,,,
00:23:24.880,00:23:26.990,皇上挺喜欢她的吧,00:23:23.798,00:23:26.046,She became a Noble Lady so soon.
00:23:27.400,00:23:28.590,似乎如此吧,00:23:26.046,00:23:28.258,His Majesty must be fond of her.
00:23:28.960,00:23:30.710,但越级晋封 有违宫规,,,
00:23:31.120,00:23:32.710,娘娘您可得劝一劝哪,00:23:28.560,00:23:33.760,"It seems so. But it's against the rules of the palace to promote
a concubine before she serves His Majesty."
00:23:32.960,00:23:34.830,宫规是老祖宗规定的,,,
00:23:35.040,00:23:38.110,祖宗就是天子 天子就是皇上,00:23:33.760,00:23:37.640,"The rules of the palace were created by our forefathers.
Those ancestors were the Sons of Heaven"
00:23:39.240,00:23:41.750,她非池中之物 迟早的事,00:23:37.640,00:23:40.261,and the current Emperor is also a Son of Heaven.
,,,00:23:40.261,00:23:43.356,"""A dragon does not belong to the pond.""
Her ascendancy was only a matter of time."
00:23:45.560,00:23:46.750,陆公公 好走,,,
00:23:46.920,00:23:47.750,多谢公公,00:23:46.510,00:23:49.331,"- Goodbye, Mr Lu.
- Thank you for coming, sir."
00:23:58.080,00:24:00.710,莞贵人吉祥 皇上一回养心殿,00:23:59.134,00:24:00.924,Peace to Noble Lady Sourire.
00:24:00.960,00:24:02.750,就吩咐奴才送来东西给莞贵人,00:24:00.924,00:24:03.900,"His Majesty ordered me to send gifts here
as soon as he got back."
00:24:03.880,00:24:04.670,有劳公公,,,
00:24:04.960,00:24:07.110,能为贵人效力 是奴才的脸面,00:24:05.000,00:24:06.300,"Thank you, sir."
00:24:07.560,00:24:08.150,贵人请看,00:24:06.300,00:24:08.509,It is an honor to be of your service.
00:24:08.480,00:24:10.470,这里是金蕾丝香囊一对,00:24:08.735,00:24:11.820,"Here is a pair of gold lace sachets,"
00:24:11.560,00:24:12.700,景泰蓝手镯一对,00:24:12.320,00:24:14.697,"a pair of blue cloisonné bracelets,"
00:24:13.680,00:24:15.270,金镶珠石兰花金钿一盒,00:24:14.886,00:24:17.309,"a box of gold-inlaid jeweled hairpins,"
00:24:16.040,00:24:18.630,如意宫花两盒 如意珠帐一幅,00:24:17.309,00:24:20.000,"two boxes of palace flower hairpins,
a pearl curtain,"
00:24:19.600,00:24:20.950,各色绸缎十六匹,00:24:20.209,00:24:22.880,"sixteen pieces of satin in various colors,"
00:24:21.960,00:24:24.310,最后一样是皇上特意交代的,00:24:22.880,00:24:25.400,and a special gift from His Majesty.
00:24:24.560,00:24:25.670,请小主务必亲观,00:24:25.400,00:24:27.229,"Please see it yourself, My Lady."
00:24:37.240,00:24:38.110,多谢皇上,,,
00:24:38.680,00:24:40.630,皇上交代 小主一直养病,00:24:38.056,00:24:39.820,I thank His Majesty.
00:24:41.000,00:24:42.060,平日难免寂寞,00:24:39.820,00:24:43.680,"His Majesty wishes for the flute to
brighten your days as you make a recovery."
00:24:42.360,00:24:44.950,所以特意供小主清玩一笑,00:24:43.680,00:24:46.170,He hopes it can bring a smile to your face.
00:24:45.960,00:24:47.430,病中不宜亲自谢恩,,,
00:24:47.840,00:24:49.510,请公公为我谢过皇上,00:24:47.077,00:24:50.900,"It's not appropriate to visit and thank His Majesty while I'm sick.
I hope you can convey my gratitude for me, sir."
00:24:50.120,00:24:50.990,小主客气,,,
00:24:51.280,00:24:53.510,皇上知道小主的身子还未痊愈,00:24:51.089,00:24:52.500,My pleasure.
00:24:53.840,00:24:55.750,人来人往有碍小主静养,00:24:52.500,00:24:55.047,His Majesty knows you shouldn't be disturbed.
00:24:56.160,00:24:58.790,除太医和皇上之外都要闭门谢客,00:24:55.047,00:24:59.487,"You may close your gate to visitors
other than His Majesty and the doctors."
00:24:59.360,00:25:00.990,还请崔姑姑代为打点,00:25:00.317,00:25:02.557,I hope Madam Cui can see to it.
00:25:01.560,00:25:03.940,是 皇上思虑周全,00:25:02.600,00:25:05.240,"Certainly, it was very thoughtful of His Majesty."
00:25:04.480,00:25:05.870,那奴才先行告退,00:25:05.579,00:25:07.533,"Allow me to take my leave, My Lady."
00:25:11.720,00:25:12.590,这一下午啊,,,
00:25:12.840,00:25:14.550,各宫赏的东西库房都堆不下了,00:25:13.000,00:25:16.000,Our storeroom is filled with gifts from other palaces.
00:25:14.720,00:25:15.190,可不是啊,,,
00:25:15.560,00:25:16.700,嬛妹妹 姐姐,,,
00:25:17.000,00:25:18.390,终于可以出人头地了,00:25:16.420,00:25:18.040,"- Huan.
- Meizhuang."
,,,00:25:18.040,00:25:20.000,This day has finally come.
00:25:20.760,00:25:21.870,参见莞贵人,00:25:21.806,00:25:23.077,Peace to Lady Sourire.
00:25:22.160,00:25:24.510,这是做什么 咱们姐妹倒生分了,00:25:23.077,00:25:25.540,What's this about? We are sisters.
00:25:24.880,00:25:26.350,眉姐姐欢喜得都疯了,,,
00:25:26.600,00:25:27.990,一听消息就拉着我过来,00:25:25.804,00:25:29.131,"Meizhuang was overjoyed over your good news
and dragged me all the way here."
00:25:28.440,00:25:30.230,我可得守着规矩醒着神,,,
00:25:30.560,00:25:33.270,总不至于大家都乐得忘乎所以了,00:25:29.546,00:25:34.271,But I have to stay clear-headed not to break any rules.
00:25:33.880,00:25:34.750,陵容说得对,,,
00:25:34.960,00:25:36.470,咱们还是快进去说话吧,00:25:35.200,00:25:37.651,"She's right, let's go talk inside."
00:25:36.840,00:25:37.510,走,00:25:37.840,00:25:38.725,Let's go.
00:25:40.880,00:25:41.830,你们都在外面守着,,,
00:25:42.240,00:25:43.030,不必进来伺候,,,
00:25:43.560,00:25:44.350,是,00:25:42.000,00:25:44.629,"We don't need to be attended to.
You may all stay outside."
00:25:45.560,00:25:47.070,姐姐怎么悄无声息地,,,
00:25:47.320,00:25:48.190,就成了莞贵人了,00:25:46.840,00:25:49.560,How did you rise and become Noble Lady Sourire without notice?
00:25:48.680,00:25:49.510,瞒得这样好,,,
00:25:49.840,00:25:51.830,先前竟一丝风声也不露,00:25:49.786,00:25:52.934,"I don't have the faintest clue.
Not a single whisper was caught in the wind."
00:25:52.320,00:25:53.790,实在不是我要隐瞒,,,
00:25:54.480,00:25:57.040,我也是在御花园中偶然遇见皇上,00:25:53.462,00:25:58.071,"I never meant to hide anything.
I met His Majesty by chance in the Imperial Garden."
00:25:57.720,00:26:00.470,古人云不鸣则已 一鸣惊人,00:25:58.637,00:26:01.660,"As the old saying goes,
""The quiet bird amazes the world when she sings."""
00:26:00.760,00:26:01.950,说的就是你了,00:26:01.660,00:26:03.400,That is your story.
00:26:02.440,00:26:05.110,我在宫中坐着 乍然听了此事,,,
00:26:05.440,00:26:06.660,还以为是讹传呢,00:26:03.680,00:26:07.800,I thought it was a rumor when my maids told me about it.
00:26:07.480,00:26:09.910,还是皇上身边的苏公公下旨传来,,,
00:26:10.200,00:26:11.030,我们才信了,00:26:08.781,00:26:11.811,"We were not convinced until
Mr. Su came to announce the edict."
00:26:11.240,00:26:12.710,就立马过来给姐姐道喜,00:26:11.811,00:26:14.010,We came immediately to congratulate you.
00:26:13.000,00:26:15.430,只是从此又要有多少双眼睛,,,
00:26:15.760,00:26:16.670,要盯着你看了,00:26:14.198,00:26:17.714,But countless pairs of eyes will be watching you now.
00:26:17.080,00:26:18.300,你可要当心哪,,,
00:26:18.520,00:26:19.150,我知道,00:26:17.940,00:26:20.600,"- You have to be careful.
- I understand."
00:26:19.920,00:26:22.220,不过皇上看重姐姐,,,
00:26:22.720,00:26:24.470,破例未侍寝就先晋封,00:26:20.929,00:26:25.640,"But His Majesty holds you in high esteem.
He made an exception and promoted you before you served him."
00:26:25.160,00:26:27.620,有皇上的恩宠 姐姐不必怕,00:26:26.093,00:26:29.098,You don't need to worry now that you're favored.
00:26:28.920,00:26:30.790,就因为未曾侍寝而晋封,,,
00:26:31.120,00:26:33.310,隆宠太盛 反而不妙,00:26:30.000,00:26:34.600,"It does worry me to be the exception.
Having too much favor is not a good thing."
00:26:33.760,00:26:35.150,如今你圣眷正宠,,,
00:26:35.520,00:26:37.270,她们也不太敢把你怎么样,00:26:35.015,00:26:38.398,"With the Emperor's favor, they can't do anything to you."
00:26:38.080,00:26:40.310,听说余氏就因为羞辱姐姐,,,
00:26:40.680,00:26:41.950,才遭皇上斥责的,00:26:39.039,00:26:43.016,"I heard His Majesty reprimanded and punished Yu
because she offended you."
00:26:42.600,00:26:43.740,有了她做榜样,,,
00:26:44.200,00:26:46.310,就没人再敢轻易招惹姐姐了,00:26:43.657,00:26:47.438,"With her as an example,
no one will dare to provoke you."
00:26:46.920,00:26:48.110,余答应是有错,,,
00:26:48.880,00:26:50.100,但我担心有一天,00:26:47.966,00:26:49.948,"Companion Yu was at fault,"
00:26:50.560,00:26:52.550,我也如余答应般不慎遭祸,00:26:50.000,00:26:54.107,but I'm afraid that the same fate will befall me one day.
00:26:53.240,00:26:55.030,岂不是要连累甄家满门,00:26:54.400,00:26:56.601,"If I make a mistake, it would implicate my entire family."
00:26:56.000,00:26:59.070,现下你正得宠也是无路可逃,00:26:57.054,00:27:00.436,There's no escape now that you're the centre of attention.
00:26:59.800,00:27:02.590,不过好在有皇上的恩宠庇佑,,,
00:27:03.080,00:27:04.590,总好过你一个人吧,00:27:00.851,00:27:06.005,"But having His Majety's favor shining on you
is better than being alone."
00:27:05.680,00:27:06.630,姐姐别忧心,,,
00:27:07.440,00:27:09.900,现下最要紧的就是把身子养好,00:27:06.811,00:27:08.543,"Don't worry, Sourire."
00:27:10.200,00:27:11.670,才能成为真正的贵人啊,00:27:08.543,00:27:12.851,"Your only concern is to nourish your health
and truly live as a Noble Lady."
00:27:12.320,00:27:13.300,陵容说得对,,,
00:27:13.640,00:27:15.030,只要你我姐妹同心,00:27:13.379,00:27:14.643,Lingrong is right.
00:27:15.520,00:27:17.670,一定能在宫中屹立不倒,00:27:14.832,00:27:19.200,"As long as we join hands,
no one can defeat us in the palace."
00:27:29.200,00:27:30.230,这是什么鬼地方,,,
00:27:30.480,00:27:31.510,怎么没人收拾一下,00:27:30.091,00:27:32.806,"What kind of hell is this place?
Why wasn't it even cleaned?"
00:27:33.000,00:27:33.790,小主啊,,,
00:27:34.360,00:27:36.920,这钟粹宫您是住不下去了,00:27:34.169,00:27:38.000,"My Lady, you are not living in the Palace of Purity anymore."
00:27:37.200,00:27:38.590,若不是皇上念着旧情,,,
00:27:38.840,00:27:41.140,我看哪 您就该去住那个冷宫了,00:27:38.103,00:27:42.320,"You would have been sent to the Cold Palace
if it weren't for His Majesty's feelings for you."
00:27:41.720,00:27:43.950,哪儿还能让您一个人住一间房子,,,
00:27:44.200,00:27:45.470,还留个宫女伺候您,00:27:42.735,00:27:46.800,You wouldn't have your own room and maid there.
00:27:46.080,00:27:47.790,我看您就别嫌弃了,,,
00:27:48.200,00:27:50.070,自个儿拾掇拾掇住下吧,00:27:47.215,00:27:51.294,"My Lady, you can clean it yourself and live with it."
00:27:53.120,00:27:57.030,公公 麻烦你让我见一下皇上吧,00:27:54.245,00:27:58.160,"Sir, please let me see His Majesty."
00:27:57.360,00:27:58.830,皇上一定会原谅我的,00:27:58.500,00:28:00.280,His Majesty will forgive me.
00:27:59.560,00:28:00.950,小主抬举了,00:28:00.506,00:28:02.540,"I'm flattered, My Lady."
00:28:02.080,00:28:04.430,咱们那都是由厦公公盼咐,00:28:03.068,00:28:05.980,But we all serve under Mr. Xia [Xiao-Xiazi].
00:28:05.360,00:28:07.870,小主您不是最瞧不起这些阉人,00:28:06.433,00:28:08.940,"Since you despise us for being eunuchs,"
00:28:08.240,00:28:09.830,咱们哪配伺候您哪,00:28:09.317,00:28:11.360,we are unworthy of serving you.
00:28:20.200,00:28:22.030,小主 您别生气了,00:28:21.500,00:28:23.527,"Don't be angry, My Lady."
00:28:24.560,00:28:26.830,叫你倡狂 叫你倡狂,,,
00:28:27.240,00:28:29.800,我叫你倡狂 我叫你倡狂,00:28:25.804,00:28:31.051,How dare you!
00:28:41.000,00:28:43.110,华妃娘娘万福金安,,,
00:28:43.520,00:28:44.830,奴才今儿个过来,00:28:42.340,00:28:44.460,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:28:45.040,00:28:47.190,是把翊坤宫的月钱送来,00:28:44.686,00:28:48.547,I brought the stipend for Your Highness's palace.
00:28:50.360,00:28:52.870,看样子这分量好似沉了点,00:28:51.498,00:28:54.218,It looks heavier than what we had last month.
00:28:53.840,00:28:55.350,份例归份例,,,
00:28:55.600,00:28:58.350,咱们内务府上下倚仗娘娘关照,00:28:54.973,00:29:01.238,"The stipend is the same, but we must show our piety
in return for Your Highness's good graces."
00:28:58.640,00:29:00.430,自该多孝敬着点儿,,,
00:29:00.640,00:29:02.830,你倒是有孝心起来吧,00:29:01.540,00:29:03.941,You have a grateful heart. Rise.
00:29:03.280,00:29:04.110,谢娘娘,00:29:04.280,00:29:05.620,I thank Your Highness.
00:29:04.840,00:29:07.140,皇上近来又封了一位贵人,00:29:05.922,00:29:08.480,"Now that His Majesty has a new Noble Lady,"
00:29:07.720,00:29:09.750,你们内务府上上下下打点,,,
00:29:10.040,00:29:10.950,怕是要忙了,00:29:08.782,00:29:11.994,"the Household Department will be busy
taking care of that."
00:29:11.200,00:29:13.230,多谢娘娘体恤 不忙,,,
00:29:13.480,00:29:15.780,再忙也不过是个贵人的差事,00:29:12.220,00:29:14.600,Not at all. I thank Your Highness for your caring words.
00:29:16.320,00:29:17.430,不费工夫,00:29:14.600,00:29:18.500,The work for a Noble Lady doesn't take much time.
00:29:17.680,00:29:19.790,那位莞贵人一直默默无闻,00:29:18.906,00:29:21.191,Lady Sourire was unheard of and unnoticed.
00:29:20.480,00:29:22.670,想必是吃了你们内务府,,,
00:29:23.040,00:29:24.310,不少委屈吧,00:29:21.606,00:29:25.325,I'm sure she's suffered some trouble from your department.
00:29:25.080,00:29:29.230,她眼看着得宠 你们就敷衍吧,00:29:26.240,00:29:30.178,"But now she's in favor,
can you keep on scraping the bare minimum?"
00:29:29.520,00:29:30.660,有你们的好,00:29:30.555,00:29:32.067,Isn't that good?
00:29:31.560,00:29:33.710,皇上若是听了她的枕头风,,,
00:29:34.320,00:29:35.990,本宫也帮不了你们,00:29:32.800,00:29:37.271,"If His Majesty listens to her pillow-side whispers,
I cannot help you with that."
00:29:38.280,00:29:40.350,还请娘娘疼奴才,00:29:39.600,00:29:42.000,"Please pity us, Your Highness."
00:29:42.360,00:29:44.150,本宫能疼你们什么呀,00:29:43.540,00:29:45.516,What can I do for you?
00:29:44.960,00:29:47.710,你们守着个内务府的差事,00:29:46.119,00:29:49.020,You manage the Household Department.
00:29:48.520,00:29:50.870,小心挑人去伺候着吧,00:29:49.737,00:29:52.227,Be careful in selecting the servants you send to her.
00:29:57.480,00:29:59.830,小主 华妃娘娘差人送来的点心,,,
00:30:00.120,00:30:00.870,小主尝尝,00:29:58.660,00:30:01.792,"My Lady, Consort Fleur had desserts sent to you.
Please have some."
00:30:03.240,00:30:05.190,听说华妃娘娘宫里的点心,,,
00:30:05.480,00:30:06.700,是连御膳房都比不上的,00:30:04.488,00:30:07.780,"Her Highness's palace makes better pastries
than the Imperial Kitchen."
00:30:07.040,00:30:08.310,而且轻易不赏人呢,00:30:08.082,00:30:09.618,They are never easily sent as a gift.
00:30:10.720,00:30:11.590,你先下去吧,,,
00:30:12.040,00:30:12.710,嗻,00:30:12.000,00:30:13.199,You can go now.
00:30:22.400,00:30:23.380,这点心,,,
00:30:24.040,00:30:26.230,果然是要比御膳房精致十倍,00:30:23.600,00:30:27.341,"The dessert looks ten times nicer
than what we receive from the Imperial Kitchen."
00:30:27.160,00:30:28.380,那小主就尝尝吧,00:30:28.208,00:30:30.000,"Then you should have some, My Lady."
00:30:32.520,00:30:33.660,一看到这点心,,,
00:30:34.720,00:30:35.990,就想到华妃拿一丈红,00:30:33.310,00:30:38.760,"But when I look at it, I'm reminded of
how Consort Fleur punished Xia with ""Three Yards of Red."""
00:30:36.320,00:30:37.380,打残了夏冬春,,,
00:30:39.000,00:30:41.670,槿汐 我真是害怕,00:30:40.000,00:30:43.080,"Jinxi, I'm really worried."
00:30:42.760,00:30:44.870,这后宫之事瞬息万变,00:30:43.948,00:30:46.471,The wind in the harem changes with every blink of an eye.
00:30:45.720,00:30:47.670,不是害怕便可应对的,00:30:46.773,00:30:49.121,Responding with fear is not enough.
00:30:49.720,00:30:51.270,不过万变不离其宗,,,
00:30:51.840,00:30:54.070,唯有恩宠二字最重要,00:30:50.805,00:30:55.265,"But all changes are of the same essence.
His Majesty's favor is the most important."
00:30:54.840,00:30:57.710,恩宠太过 便是六宫侧目,00:30:55.680,00:30:58.936,Too much favor is frowned upon by the harem;
00:30:58.080,00:30:59.110,恩宠太少,,,
00:30:59.680,00:31:02.110,便是六宫践踏 人人可欺,00:30:59.200,00:31:03.360,Too little favor is trodden upon by anyone.
00:31:03.640,00:31:06.350,小主要知道 无论您是否得宠,00:31:04.860,00:31:07.494,"My Lady, you must know that"
00:31:07.080,00:31:08.270,这后宫的争斗,,,
00:31:09.000,00:31:10.510,其实您从未远离过,00:31:08.098,00:31:11.837,"whether you're in favor or not,
rivalries are never far away from you."
00:31:11.560,00:31:14.350,就好比小主与沈贵人,,,
00:31:14.640,00:31:15.860,和安答应交好,00:31:12.667,00:31:16.696,"For example, you are close with Lady Shen and Companion An,"
00:31:16.320,00:31:18.390,便会被他人视为一党,00:31:17.299,00:31:19.809,and you will be seen as your own faction.
00:31:19.040,00:31:20.430,我与姐姐一同长大,,,
00:31:21.120,00:31:23.710,自然是要同心同德 彼此照应的,00:31:19.960,00:31:24.900,"Meizhuang and I grew up together.
We will look after each other with one heart and mind."
00:31:24.120,00:31:25.630,小主与沈贵人姐妹情深,,,
00:31:25.920,00:31:26.900,自然是好的,00:31:25.126,00:31:28.091,I didn't mean your sisterly bond is a bad thing.
00:31:27.560,00:31:30.950,只是所谓同心同德 彼此照应,00:31:28.544,00:31:32.204,"But speaking of ""one heart and mind"","
00:31:31.480,00:31:32.670,不只是后宫之中,,,
00:31:33.680,00:31:35.390,也是宫中与前朝,00:31:32.468,00:31:36.397,"that's not only true for the harem,
but also for the harem and the court."
00:31:36.160,00:31:38.070,小主看看华妃娘娘便可知,,,
00:31:38.800,00:31:41.550,这后宫之宠和母家之荣,00:31:37.340,00:31:40.000,You can see that from Consort Fleur's example.
00:31:42.160,00:31:43.870,可是息息相关的,00:31:40.000,00:31:45.116,"Favor in harem is inextricably linked
to the shifting tides at court."
00:31:46.000,00:31:47.590,我只求保我甄家平安,,,
00:31:49.320,00:31:50.590,求皇上对我真心,00:31:47.080,00:31:51.840,"I only wish for my family to have a peaceful life,
and for His Majesty to treat me with a kind heart."
00:31:52.200,00:31:53.990,小主这样想便是最好的了,00:31:53.460,00:31:55.621,"I'm glad you think that way, My Lady."
00:31:55.440,00:31:57.900,其实小主既然入宫,,,
00:31:58.480,00:31:59.390,就便从此,,,
00:31:59.600,00:32:01.550,与宫外的姑娘再无相同之处,00:31:56.338,00:32:02.603,"Since you have entered the palace as a concubine,
you are no longer the same as the ordinary girls outside."
00:32:02.200,00:32:05.310,生死祸福有时候自己是没得选的,00:32:03.282,00:32:06.719,You don't always have control over life and death.
00:32:06.440,00:32:07.660,不过奴婢看得出,,,
00:32:08.240,00:32:09.550,皇上很喜欢小主,00:32:07.436,00:32:11.365,"Fortunately, I can see His Majesty is very fond of you."
00:32:10.560,00:32:12.070,小主也喜欢皇上,,,
00:32:12.600,00:32:13.870,那天我去倚梅园,00:32:11.591,00:32:13.224,And you are fond of him too.
00:32:14.520,00:32:15.830,其实有三个愿望,00:32:13.677,00:32:17.440,"I was going to make three wishes
in the Garden of Leaning Plums."
00:32:16.360,00:32:17.270,但最后一个,,,
00:32:17.520,00:32:18.790,却没有来得及说出来,00:32:17.580,00:32:20.000,But I didn't have time to say the last one.
00:32:19.280,00:32:20.550,奴婢洗耳恭听呢,00:32:20.100,00:32:21.916,"I'm listening with my whole heart, My Lady."
00:32:21.920,00:32:22.900,第三愿,00:32:22.897,00:32:24.643,My third wish:
00:32:23.640,00:32:26.630,便得一心人 白头不相离,00:32:24.643,00:32:27.963,I wish to grow gray and old with one who loves me wholeheartedly.
00:32:28.720,00:32:30.150,可我这一心人,00:32:30.060,00:32:32.284,But the one who has my heart
00:32:31.680,00:32:34.350,偏偏是这世间最无法一心的人,00:32:32.888,00:32:35.675,is the last person who can love me with his whole heart.
00:32:34.800,00:32:36.190,那就退而求其次,00:32:35.864,00:32:37.643,But you can wish for the next best thing.
00:32:36.800,00:32:40.670,不求一心 但求用心,00:32:37.832,00:32:41.637,"Instead of his whole heart,
you can hope for his earnest heart."
00:32:57.960,00:33:01.030,小主身子已经好了大半,00:32:59.254,00:33:02.510,"My Lady, your health has generally recovered."
00:33:05.360,00:33:08.550,不过微臣还是可以向皇上陈情,00:33:06.539,00:33:10.017,But I can still explain to His Majesty
00:33:09.320,00:33:10.910,说小主的身体情况,,,
00:33:11.280,00:33:12.550,仍然不适宜侍寝,00:33:10.470,00:33:13.752,that your condition is still not favorable for serving him.
00:33:13.360,00:33:14.230,我的病,,,
00:33:14.600,00:33:16.630,不过是一直用药拖着才未痊愈,00:33:14.393,00:33:17.920,We've been slowing down my recovery with herbs for a long time.
00:33:19.240,00:33:21.150,皇上若派其他太医为我诊治,,,
00:33:21.440,00:33:22.190,会被发现吗,00:33:20.440,00:33:23.400,"If His Majesty sends other doctors to treat me,
will they be able to find out?"
00:33:23.000,00:33:24.910,一旦查出 结果会怎样,00:33:24.117,00:33:26.325,What will happen if they do?
00:33:29.960,00:33:32.630,上次是否用药 你有得选 我也是,00:33:31.140,00:33:34.107,"Last time, we both had the choice to use herbs."
00:33:33.280,00:33:36.310,这次要不留痕迹地痊愈,00:33:34.560,00:33:37.698,"This time, I have to make a full recovery behind closed doors."
00:33:36.920,00:33:38.830,你没得选 我也是,00:33:38.000,00:33:40.280,"You have no option, and neither do I."
00:33:42.120,00:33:44.500,微臣但凭小主吩咐,00:33:43.203,00:33:45.803,"I'll obey your orders, My Lady."
00:33:46.040,00:33:47.550,在后宫没有温大人,,,
00:33:47.880,00:33:48.990,嬛儿如履薄冰,00:33:47.021,00:33:50.262,"I would be walking on thin ice without your help, Dr. Wen."
00:33:50.520,00:33:51.870,微臣不改初衷,,,
00:33:52.120,00:33:53.550,一定护得小主周全,00:33:51.544,00:33:54.603,I will always keep my promise to protect you.
00:33:53.920,00:33:54.710,那就好,00:33:54.791,00:33:55.938,Thank you.
00:33:55.640,00:33:57.470,那就请温大人治好嬛儿的病,,,
00:33:58.120,00:33:59.340,但别太快治好了,00:33:56.731,00:34:00.579,"Please restore me to my health,
but not so fast."
00:34:01.040,00:34:02.910,一个月为期最佳,00:34:02.200,00:34:04.238,A month would be ideal.
00:34:03.680,00:34:06.240,那微臣会逐渐减少药量,,,
00:34:06.760,00:34:08.950,再适时加一些补药进去,00:34:04.653,00:34:10.000,I will reduce the dosage and add nourishing herbs.
00:34:09.800,00:34:10.780,也就无大碍了,00:34:10.754,00:34:12.226,That will do.
00:34:12.320,00:34:13.630,那就有劳温大人了,00:34:13.260,00:34:15.141,"Thank you, Dr. Wen."
00:34:22.960,00:34:23.830,温太医好走,00:34:24.000,00:34:25.580,"Goodbye, Dr. Wen."
00:34:53.440,00:34:55.310,奴才给小主请安,00:34:54.595,00:34:56.707,Peace to Noble Lady Sourire.
00:34:56.360,00:34:59.390,启禀小主 这些个宫女 太监,,,
00:34:59.600,00:35:02.790,都是精挑细选出来伺候小主的,00:34:57.386,00:35:03.934,"We have diligently selected the best maids and eunuchs
to serve you, My Lady."
00:35:03.960,00:35:04.870,公公请起吧,,,
00:35:05.280,00:35:06.070,谢小主,00:35:05.028,00:35:07.260,"Please rise, sir."
00:35:07.200,00:35:08.990,黄公公挑的人必然是好的,00:35:08.127,00:35:10.474,"I trust your choices, Mr Huang."
00:35:09.840,00:35:11.150,要不然以后有什么事,,,
00:35:11.560,00:35:12.910,我便只找黄公公一个了,00:35:10.813,00:35:14.286,"Otherwise, if anything goes wrong,
I'll have to send for your service."
00:35:13.400,00:35:14.510,是 是,00:35:14.286,00:35:15.439,"Yes, yes."

00:35:16.880,00:35:17.910,带下去好好教导就是,00:35:16.382,00:35:19.380,"Jinxi, help them orient themselves."
00:35:18.160,00:35:20.540,是 都跟我走吧,,,
00:35:22.480,00:35:23.620,奴才昏聩,00:35:20.717,00:35:22.071,Follow me.
00:35:23.920,00:35:26.150,因前几日忙着内务府的琐事,00:35:23.502,00:35:27.191,"My Lady, I beg your forgiveness for my idiocy.
I was occupied with some trivial matters"
00:35:26.520,00:35:28.870,把给小主宫里桌椅上漆那回事,,,
00:35:29.160,00:35:30.350,交给了小路子去办,00:35:27.569,00:35:31.520,"and asked Xiao-Luzi to take care of
the painting request from your palace."
00:35:30.640,00:35:33.310,谁知道这狗奴才办事不上心,,,
00:35:33.800,00:35:34.860,居然给忘了,00:35:31.600,00:35:35.920,But this fool was careless and dared to forget about it.
00:35:35.120,00:35:37.030,奴才今日特意带了他来,,,
00:35:37.560,00:35:40.070,给小主请罪 还请小主发落,00:35:36.184,00:35:41.298,"I've brought the offender here today, My Lady,
hoping that he can receive your punishment and pardon."
00:35:42.960,00:35:45.230,黄公公的请罪我们可不敢受,,,
00:35:45.520,00:35:47.550,没的背后又听见些不该听的,00:35:44.178,00:35:46.594,"We dare not punish your staff, Mr. Huang."
00:35:48.120,00:35:49.070,让人呛得慌,00:35:46.594,00:35:49.998,"They will talk about our palace
and their words can choke us."
00:35:49.400,00:35:51.350,流朱 越发不懂规矩了,00:35:50.340,00:35:52.696,"Vermilion, mind your manners."
00:35:52.480,00:35:53.790,瞧姑娘说的,,,
00:35:54.000,00:35:56.460,这都是奴才教导下面的人无方,00:35:53.639,00:35:57.803,"It's not like that, Miss.
It's all my fault for not properly disciplining my staff."
00:35:57.240,00:35:58.270,公公言重了,00:35:58.180,00:35:59.845,"It's not your fault, sir."
00:35:59.160,00:36:01.790,其实内务府的事千头万绪,,,
00:36:02.200,00:36:03.230,人事相关,00:36:00.260,00:36:04.381,"Your department manages thousands of strands and
loose ends, intertwined with people's affairs."
00:36:03.920,00:36:05.870,底下的人一时疏忽也是有的,,,
00:36:06.360,00:36:07.870,公公何来请罪之说呢,00:36:04.946,00:36:08.954,"Some oversight is inevitable.
Why should that deserve any punishment?"
00:36:08.160,00:36:09.630,多谢小主体恤,,,
00:36:09.880,00:36:12.310,奴才们日后必定更加上心,00:36:09.180,00:36:11.160,"Thank you for your caring words, My Lady."
00:36:12.680,00:36:13.550,为小主效力,00:36:11.160,00:36:14.780,"We will do more than our best
to serve you in the future."
00:36:14.120,00:36:14.550,对了,,,
00:36:14.760,00:36:17.110,奴才还着人抬了一张新桌子来,00:36:15.082,00:36:18.380,"We brought you a new table, My Lady."
00:36:17.360,00:36:19.110,还请小主不嫌粗陋,00:36:18.380,00:36:20.320,I hope you can pardon its crudeness.
00:36:20.480,00:36:22.070,多谢公公心里还想着,00:36:21.528,00:36:23.304,Thank you for remembering my request.
00:36:23.080,00:36:24.830,小允子收下吧,00:36:24.000,00:36:26.068,"Xiao-Yunzi, put it away."
00:36:25.160,00:36:25.750,是,,,
00:36:26.920,00:36:28.190,小主要没别的事,,,
00:36:28.520,00:36:29.710,奴才就先告退了,00:36:27.200,00:36:31.060,"My Lady, I shall take my leave
if you do not have other requests."
00:36:30.400,00:36:31.110,公公慢走,,,
00:36:31.320,00:36:32.110,谢小主,00:36:31.399,00:36:33.231,"- Take care, sir.
- Thank you, My Lady."
00:36:33.120,00:36:33.990,走 走,00:36:34.099,00:36:35.437,"Go, go."
00:36:38.400,00:36:40.070,你怎么言语上这样不谨慎,00:36:39.297,00:36:41.680,Why were you so imprudent with your words?
00:36:41.240,00:36:42.710,这黄规全见风使舵,,,
00:36:43.160,00:36:44.430,先前克扣小主的用度,00:36:41.869,00:36:44.560,Huang Guiquan turns his ship whenever the wind changes direction.
00:36:44.760,00:36:45.820,如今见小主得了宠,,,
00:36:46.240,00:36:48.230,便一味拿了旁人来顶罪拍马,00:36:44.560,00:36:49.280,"He embezzled your supplies before,
and has now sent a scapegoat to butter you up."
00:36:48.640,00:36:49.590,你自己心里明白,,,
00:36:49.920,00:36:50.870,知道提防就行了,00:36:49.582,00:36:52.320,You can keep that to yourself and be vigilant.
00:36:51.320,00:36:52.300,撕破脸传出去,,,
00:36:52.680,00:36:54.510,只会叫别人说我们得势张狂,00:36:52.546,00:36:55.780,"If you offend him openly, others will say
we have become arrogant because of our status."
00:36:55.760,00:36:58.060,那那奴婢不敢了,00:36:56.195,00:36:59.374,Oh... I won't do it again.
00:36:58.560,00:36:59.700,我知道你是真我好,,,
00:37:00.160,00:37:01.670,但是不该争一时的意气,00:36:59.600,00:37:03.020,"I know you were doing it for me.
But we are not fighting this battle with our tongues."
00:37:02.680,00:37:04.830,见风使舵的事宫中人人都会,,,
00:37:05.240,00:37:06.550,不止他黄规全一个,00:37:03.737,00:37:07.856,"Everyone in the palace bends with the wind.
Not just Huang Guiquan."
00:37:08.160,00:37:09.220,奴婢知错了,00:37:09.141,00:37:10.441,"I'm sorry, My Lady."
00:37:13.120,00:37:14.260,你警醒他两句也好,,,
00:37:15.000,00:37:15.870,让他有个忌惮,00:37:14.241,00:37:17.321,It's all right. Your words cautioned him.
00:37:16.800,00:37:18.750,告诉底下人 不许他们生事,00:37:17.924,00:37:20.303,Tell the servants not to talk about it.
00:37:20.360,00:37:23.710,小主 这黄规全是华妃的远亲,00:37:21.592,00:37:24.996,"My Lady, Huang Guiquan is a relative of Consort Fleur."
00:37:24.360,00:37:27.630,我知道 我会告诉槿汐和小允子,,,
00:37:28.160,00:37:29.630,打起十二分的精神盯着,00:37:25.260,00:37:30.933,"I know. I'll tell Jinxi and Xiao-Yunzi
to watch the newcomers with extra vigilance."
00:37:30.680,00:37:32.630,不许黄规全送来的人有什么手脚,00:37:31.536,00:37:33.791,in case anyone lays a finger on us.
00:37:33.440,00:37:36.150,另外只派他们做粗活,00:37:34.404,00:37:37.626,They will only do menial tasks.
00:37:36.800,00:37:38.590,我近身的事仍由你们伺候,00:37:37.815,00:37:40.180,You will keep tending to my personal tasks.
00:37:39.200,00:37:39.910,奴婢知道,00:37:40.180,00:37:41.274,"Yes, My Lady."
00:37:43.400,00:37:44.380,莞贵人吉祥,,,
00:37:45.080,00:37:46.830,皇上午后会移驾碎玉轩,00:37:44.460,00:37:45.636,Peace to Lady Sourire.
00:37:47.240,00:37:48.220,小主快些准备吧,00:37:46.202,00:37:49.444,"His Majesty will be here after lunch.
Please be prepared."
00:37:48.760,00:37:49.590,谢公公,,,
00:37:49.840,00:37:51.390,那小主赶紧更衣准备吧,00:37:49.670,00:37:50.800,"Thank you, sir."
00:37:55.200,00:37:56.180,皇上要过来,00:37:50.800,00:37:52.733,"You may take your time and get changed, My Lady."
00:37:56.480,00:37:58.670,小主换一身鲜亮的衣服接驾吧,00:37:56.429,00:38:00.109,"His Majesty is coming.
My Lady, you should wear a bright-colored dress."
00:38:00.080,00:38:01.870,就这身衣裳挺好的,00:38:01.060,00:38:02.943,Why? This looks fine.
00:38:02.360,00:38:05.390,好是好 就是稍稍素了一点,00:38:03.358,00:38:06.400,"It is nice, but it looks a bit too simple."
00:38:06.400,00:38:08.550,就是要这样家常的样子才好呢,00:38:07.501,00:38:10.060,What's wrong with being a little homey?
00:38:19.360,00:38:20.750,皇上万福金安,00:38:20.600,00:38:22.380,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:38:25.600,00:38:27.710,外头风大快随朕进去,00:38:26.736,00:38:29.145,It's windy today. Let's go inside quickly.
00:38:28.560,00:38:29.150,是,,,
00:38:33.040,00:38:36.070,清水出芙蓉 天然去雕饰,00:38:34.200,00:38:37.800,"""A lotus has surfaced from the clear water;
her beauty is naturally unadorned.”"
00:38:36.800,00:38:39.390,朕的莞贵人果然是与众不同,00:38:38.026,00:38:40.929,My Lady Sourire is surely one of a kind.
00:38:41.640,00:38:44.830,皇上不嫌弃臣妾蒲柳之质罢了,00:38:42.737,00:38:46.380,"It's because Your Majesty appreciates
my plainness, like the catkins of willow."
00:38:45.320,00:38:46.540,你打扮得别致,,,
00:38:46.840,00:38:48.430,你这宫女穿得也清秀,00:38:46.569,00:38:49.760,"You are dressed elegantly,
and your maids are also exquisite."
00:38:48.800,00:38:50.630,看着叫人神清气爽,00:38:50.000,00:38:52.000,It feels like a refreshing breeze to the mind.
00:38:51.680,00:38:53.750,浣碧是臣妾的贴身侍婢,00:38:52.100,00:38:55.200,"This is my dowry maid, Jade."
00:38:54.280,00:38:57.390,浣碧 难怪穿一身碧色,00:38:55.200,00:38:58.495,Jade? No wonder she's dressed in jade.
00:39:03.400,00:39:04.670,浣碧 浣碧,00:39:04.700,00:39:06.115,Jade.
00:39:06.480,00:39:07.950,这时候皇上不一定喜欢人多,,,
00:39:08.320,00:39:09.150,咱们搁这儿等着就是了,00:39:07.435,00:39:10.880,"His Majesty might not like more followers.
Let's stay outside."
00:39:10.840,00:39:11.390,也好,,,
00:39:12.560,00:39:13.510,浣碧姐姐,00:39:11.960,00:39:13.011,Just as well.
00:39:14.160,00:39:15.830,同样的宫女穿绿色的衣裳,,,
00:39:16.240,00:39:18.070,浣碧姐姐就能得到皇上的夸奖,00:39:13.790,00:39:19.145,"While many other maids are wearing the same color,
you were the only one noticed by His Majesty."
00:39:19.200,00:39:21.270,我原以为皇上会先看到流朱的,,,
00:39:21.880,00:39:23.020,她穿红色的显眼,00:39:20.201,00:39:24.040,"I thought His Majesty would notice Vermilion first
for her red dress."
00:39:23.600,00:39:24.510,流朱姐姐也美,,,
00:39:24.960,00:39:26.150,只是不像浣碧姐姐,,,
00:39:26.480,00:39:27.590,眉眼有些像小主,00:39:24.606,00:39:28.600,"Vermilion is beautiful too,
but you bear resemblance to My Lady."
00:39:28.040,00:39:29.510,皇上才会格外留神的,00:39:28.977,00:39:30.878,That's why you caught His Majesty's attention.
00:39:29.960,00:39:30.750,是吗,00:39:30.878,00:39:32.158,Is that so?
00:39:43.120,00:39:45.550,皇上喝盏茶 臣妾烹的,00:39:44.460,00:39:46.814,"Your Majesty, I made some tea for you."
00:39:46.200,00:39:47.790,不知是否合皇上脾胃,00:39:47.304,00:39:49.251,I don't know if it suits Your Majesty's taste.
00:39:50.520,00:39:54.630,你亲手调的 这心意朕最喜欢,00:39:51.774,00:39:55.714,You made it yourself. I appreciate your thoughtfulness.
00:40:06.800,00:40:07.670,好香的茶,00:40:08.000,00:40:09.460,The tea smells so fragrant.
00:40:16.200,00:40:20.150,这茶格外地清冽 沁香,00:40:17.480,00:40:21.068,It smells fresh and goes deep into the lungs.
00:40:20.800,00:40:23.990,朕品了 是越州寒茶,00:40:21.860,00:40:25.412,It's winter tea from Yuezhou.
00:40:25.000,00:40:28.390,放了梅花和松针 还放了什么,00:40:25.940,00:40:29.485,"You added plum flowers and pine leaves.
What else is in it?"
00:40:29.840,00:40:31.030,皇上好灵的舌头,00:40:30.900,00:40:32.680,Your Majesty has expert taste.
00:40:31.760,00:40:33.950,这道茶叫岁寒三友,00:40:32.815,00:40:35.230,"I named the tea ""the three winter friends""."
00:40:34.520,00:40:37.470,是取松针 竹叶和梅花一起烹的,00:40:35.569,00:40:38.820,"It's brewed with plum flowers, pine needles, and bamboo leaves."
00:40:38.200,00:40:41.270,那水是夏日日出前荷叶上的露珠,,,
00:40:41.720,00:40:43.150,才能有如此清新,00:40:39.159,00:40:44.180,"The water is from the dewdrops on lotus leaves
collected last summer."
00:40:43.440,00:40:46.110,古人云茶可以清心也,00:40:44.482,00:40:47.276,"""Tea clears a foggy mind."""
00:40:46.720,00:40:48.110,今日喝了你的茶,,,
00:40:48.360,00:40:50.820,朕才知古人所言不虚呀,00:40:47.766,00:40:52.020,"After drinking your tea,
I realize the truth behind what the ancients said."
00:40:51.080,00:40:51.950,皇上过奖了,,,
00:40:52.640,00:40:53.860,也是机缘凑巧,00:40:52.040,00:40:53.335,I'm flattered.
00:40:54.440,00:40:56.710,臣妾去岁收了两瓮舍不得喝,00:40:53.713,00:40:57.880,I received two jars of the tea last year.
00:40:57.000,00:40:58.270,特意带了一瓮进宫,,,
00:40:58.600,00:41:00.030,就埋在堂后的梨树下,00:40:58.069,00:41:01.429,"I brought one to the palace
and stored the water under the pear tree in the yard."
00:41:00.680,00:41:02.110,前两日才启出来的,00:41:01.730,00:41:03.515,We started making the tea two days ago.
00:41:06.320,00:41:08.430,这碎玉轩住着还惯吗,00:41:07.294,00:41:09.601,How do you like living in this palace?
00:41:08.680,00:41:10.390,朕瞧着偏远了些,00:41:09.601,00:41:11.917,It seems to be a bit remote.
00:41:11.320,00:41:12.460,多谢皇上关怀,00:41:12.332,00:41:14.444,I thank Your Majesty for asking.
00:41:13.400,00:41:15.780,臣妾觉得还好 清静得很,00:41:14.633,00:41:17.163,I enjoy living here. It's quiet and peaceful.
00:41:22.800,00:41:24.470,碎玉轩是清静,,,
00:41:24.840,00:41:27.140,就是离朕的养心殿远了些,00:41:24.000,00:41:28.000,"It is peaceful, but a bit far
from the Hall of Mental Cultivation."
00:41:27.920,00:41:30.430,不过朕有心来 不怕远,00:41:28.886,00:41:31.769,But my heart isn't hindered by the distance.
00:41:32.120,00:41:33.100,心近就好,00:41:32.998,00:41:34.698,As long as our hearts are close.
00:41:34.400,00:41:36.750,对咱们心近,00:41:35.604,00:41:38.059,"Yes, our hearts are always close."
00:41:39.480,00:41:41.750,朕瞧着你的气色好了不少,,,
00:41:42.240,00:41:43.350,应该快大好了,00:41:40.701,00:41:44.401,"You look much healthier now.

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;
