00:07:53.280,00:07:54.790,所以戏台子特别多,00:07:51.895,00:07:55.733,"There are many theaters in the palace
to entertain the concubines."
00:07:55.360,00:07:56.830,这儿呢有点远,,,

00:07:58.800,00:08:00.230,就改成住所了,00:07:59.783,00:08:01.650,so it was built into a residence.
00:08:00.480,00:08:02.710,您看 倒还别致吧,00:08:02.216,00:08:04.030,"How do you like the palace, My Lady?"

00:09:17.000,00:09:18.190,小主有所不知,,,
00:09:18.800,00:09:21.070,芳贵人已不住在碎玉轩,00:09:18.360,00:09:22.180,"My Lady, Lady Parfum does not live here any more."
00:09:21.800,00:09:24.260,现如今西配殿是空着的,00:09:22.920,00:09:25.440,Her west chamber is vacant.
00:09:24.920,00:09:26.430,东配殿的淳常在,,,
00:09:26.680,00:09:28.430,于四日前刚刚入宫,00:09:26.040,00:09:29.540,Attendant Chun moved into the east chamber four days ago.
00:09:28.720,00:09:31.350,晚些时候自会前来与小主相见,00:09:29.840,00:09:32.600,Naturally she will visit you later.
00:09:33.400,00:09:35.700,小主 这是小允子,00:09:34.480,00:09:37.000,"My Lady, this is Xiao-Yunzi."
00:09:36.880,00:09:39.150,这二位是康禄海的徒弟,,,
00:09:39.480,00:09:41.270,小荷子 小印子,00:09:38.000,00:09:43.300,"These two are apprentices of Mr. Kang:
Xiao-Hezi and Xiao-Yinzi."
00:09:42.440,00:09:44.740,这是宫女佩儿和菊青,00:09:43.580,00:09:46.109,These are your maids: Violet and Daisy.
00:09:45.480,00:09:47.830,都是专门伺候小主的,00:09:46.620,00:09:49.700,They are all in your service solely.
00:09:49.000,00:09:51.510,莞常在万福金安,00:09:50.300,00:09:53.018,"May peace and grace be with you, My Lady."
00:09:53.520,00:09:56.790,今后你们便是我的人了,00:09:54.802,00:09:58.047,"From today on, you will be under my name."
00:09:58.040,00:10:01.070,在我名下当差伶俐自然是好,00:09:59.180,00:10:02.303,"While I appreciate you being smart and competent,"
00:10:01.880,00:10:04.180,但我更看重忠心二字,00:10:02.944,00:10:05.680,"above all else, I value your loyalty."
00:10:04.920,00:10:05.790,是是是,,,
00:10:06.040,00:10:06.950,你们可记牢了,00:10:05.980,00:10:06.940,Yes. Yes.
,,,00:10:06.940,00:10:08.320,Is that understood?
00:10:07.200,00:10:10.630,奴才们必当忠心耿耿 绝无二心,00:10:08.320,00:10:11.800,"My Lady, we pledge to have steadfast loyalty and undivided faith."
00:10:12.520,00:10:13.150,赏吧,00:10:13.580,00:10:14.761,Go ahead.
00:10:20.240,00:10:21.630,奴才们在这儿伺候着,00:10:21.340,00:10:23.087,"We'll be at your service, My Lady."
00:10:22.040,00:10:24.630,小主今儿也累了 请先歇了吧,00:10:23.087,00:10:25.760,Would you like to have a rest after the tiring trip?
00:10:26.120,00:10:26.990,先退下吧,,,
00:10:27.680,00:10:28.900,是 是,00:10:27.160,00:10:28.800,"Yes, you may leave."
,,,00:10:28.800,00:10:29.840,Yes. Yes.
00:10:39.440,00:10:41.430,崔姑姑入宫有些日子了吧,00:10:40.400,00:10:42.923,"Madam Cui, you must have been in the palace for a while."
00:10:43.240,00:10:44.110,奴婢不敢,,,
00:10:44.600,00:10:46.630,小主还是直呼奴婢贱名,00:10:44.300,00:10:47.880,"My Lady, please call me by my humble name: Jinxi."
00:10:47.160,00:10:48.380,姑姑且起来说话,,,
00:10:49.600,00:10:51.270,我一向是没规矩惯了的,00:10:48.340,00:10:50.380,"Madam, please stand."
00:10:52.040,00:10:53.750,咱们名分上虽是主仆,00:10:50.833,00:10:53.045,I've never grown accustomed to the rules.
00:10:54.240,00:10:56.270,可是你比我年长 阅历又多,00:10:53.200,00:10:57.425,"Although you are in my service,
you are my elder and more experienced in the palace."
00:10:56.800,00:10:58.150,我心里是很敬你的,00:10:57.878,00:10:59.441,I hold great respect for you.
00:10:59.400,00:11:01.070,小主真是折煞奴婢了,00:11:00.280,00:11:02.469,"I'm not worthy of your courteous words, My Lady."
00:11:01.920,00:11:03.830,奴婢先前是侍服太妃的,,,
00:11:04.400,00:11:06.190,因太妃心静不喜人多,00:11:03.000,00:11:05.480,I used to serve a concubine of the prior emperor.
00:11:06.600,00:11:07.660,便被指了过来,00:11:05.558,00:11:09.173,She preferred to have fewer maids and reassigned me.
00:11:08.640,00:11:10.590,服侍过太妃的人必然稳妥,00:11:09.840,00:11:12.316,"With such an extended service in the palace,
you must be a reliable person."
00:11:11.800,00:11:12.830,小主过奖,,,
00:11:13.200,00:11:14.390,那以后宫中的杂事,00:11:12.920,00:11:14.120,"I'm flattered, My Lady."
00:11:14.880,00:11:17.070,就要有劳你与康公公一同打理了,00:11:14.120,00:11:18.160,"I'll have to trouble you and Mr. Kang from now
to take care of my palace matters."
00:11:17.280,00:11:20.070,小主放心奴婢定尽心竭力,00:11:18.220,00:11:21.280,"My Lady, I will spare no effort."
00:11:21.680,00:11:23.110,姑姑且去歇息,,,
00:11:23.520,00:11:25.470,让流朱和浣碧服侍更衣就是,00:11:23.026,00:11:26.747,"Please go have a break.
Vermilion and Jade will take over."
00:11:26.680,00:11:27.820,那奴婢告退了,00:11:27.800,00:11:29.538,"I take my leave, My Lady."
00:11:41.440,00:11:44.110,快坐下吧 拘束一天了,00:11:42.745,00:11:45.616,Let's all sit. What a stressful day!
00:11:48.560,00:11:51.270,可吓坏我了 宫里好大的规矩,00:11:49.746,00:11:52.640,"There were a whole lot of rules!
It was so scary."
00:11:51.560,00:11:53.110,不过啊 可真好看,00:11:52.720,00:11:54.601,But the room's so nice.
00:11:54.040,00:11:56.110,你可别光顾着看哪 规矩要紧,00:11:55.302,00:11:57.920,"Be watchful of the rules, not only the room."
00:11:57.160,00:11:58.670,你们俩是我带进宫来的,,,
00:11:59.240,00:12:01.390,这说话举止都要格外小心,00:11:58.302,00:12:00.238,I brought you two into the palace.
00:12:01.640,00:12:02.510,别落了差池,00:12:00.280,00:12:03.600,You must be extremely careful of your speech and manners.
00:12:03.160,00:12:03.830,我知道,,,
00:12:04.720,00:12:05.390,流朱啊,00:12:04.000,00:12:05.169,Of course!
00:12:05.600,00:12:06.870,只要管住她的快嘴就是了,00:12:05.618,00:12:07.778,Vermilion just needs to control her quick tongue.
00:12:07.160,00:12:07.630,讨厌,,,
00:12:07.880,00:12:09.390,她的嘴虽快 但也不坏事,00:12:07.800,00:12:08.840,You're annoying!
00:12:09.720,00:12:11.310,知道什么能说 什么不能说,00:12:08.840,00:12:10.949,"She has a sharp tongue, but it doesn't hurt."
,,,00:12:10.949,00:12:12.760,She knows what to say and what not to.
00:12:15.840,00:12:18.750,你们俩是自幼和我一同长大的,00:12:17.028,00:12:20.213,You two grew up with me together
00:12:19.600,00:12:21.110,如今又和我一同入宫,,,
00:12:21.880,00:12:23.270,在这宫里过日子,00:12:20.515,00:12:22.950,and have now moved into the palace with me.
00:12:23.840,00:12:25.390,若是身边人不可靠,00:12:23.176,00:12:26.824,Living here is like walking along a cliff with our eyes covered.
00:12:25.760,00:12:28.030,就有如盲人走在悬崖峭壁边,,,
00:12:28.280,00:12:29.870,时时有粉身碎骨之险,00:12:26.824,00:12:30.968,"If we can't trust those around us, we can fall into ruin at any time."
00:12:31.400,00:12:35.350,咱们三人是一荣俱荣 一损俱损,00:12:32.500,00:12:36.621,"If one of us rises or falls, so will the others."
00:12:36.680,00:12:38.980,我知道小主待我们如亲姐妹一般,00:12:37.680,00:12:40.132,"You treat us like your sisters, My Lady."
00:12:39.240,00:12:41.540,我和浣碧一定好好护着小主,00:12:40.396,00:12:42.764,Jade and I will protect you at our best.
00:12:42.160,00:12:42.990,你们护着我,,,
00:12:43.280,00:12:44.230,我也得好好护着你们,00:12:43.284,00:12:45.868,I will take good care of you both as well.
00:12:46.720,00:12:47.940,小主安心便是了,00:12:47.840,00:12:49.760,"Please don't worry, My Lady."
00:12:50.600,00:12:52.190,娘娘看了一上午的书了,,,
00:12:52.480,00:12:53.990,吃点新贡的蜜橘吧,00:12:51.792,00:12:55.110,"Your Majesty has been reading all morning.
Would you like to have some tangerines?"
00:12:54.680,00:12:55.740,这个时辰,,,
00:12:55.960,00:12:58.550,新入宫的嫔妃都安顿好了吧,00:12:55.760,00:12:59.860,The new concubines must have settled in by this hour.
00:12:59.080,00:13:01.750,是 都已经到各自宫里歇息了,00:13:00.280,00:13:02.980,"Yes, they have ensconced themselves in their palaces."
00:13:02.760,00:13:04.270,本宫难得有那么清闲,,,
00:13:04.600,00:13:05.910,让华妃独自操劳了,00:13:03.860,00:13:07.120,"I can finally have some time to myself
while Consort Fleur takes care of the palace."
00:13:06.320,00:13:08.190,说到华妃奴婢就生气,00:13:07.459,00:13:09.760,She's the only one Your Majesty should worry about.
00:13:09.040,00:13:10.230,娘娘看这蜜橘,,,
00:13:10.560,00:13:11.990,本来有上好的柚子,,,
00:13:12.400,00:13:15.030,偏偏被华妃宫里的颂芝给挑走了,00:13:10.200,00:13:16.040,"There were excellent pomelos offered as tribute,
but Songzhi took them and gave us the tangerines."
00:13:15.360,00:13:18.350,还道皇上午后要去她们宫里用膳,,,
00:13:18.640,00:13:20.230,自然要挑最好的奉上,00:13:16.500,00:13:21.260,"She claimed that her palace deserves the best
because His Majesty will have lunch there."
00:13:21.360,00:13:22.340,上回也是,,,
00:13:22.640,00:13:24.670,苏州织造新进贡的缎子,00:13:22.240,00:13:23.640,"And last time,"
00:13:24.880,00:13:26.390,也是让她们宫里先挑走的,00:13:23.800,00:13:27.367,"when Suzhou Clothing Services supplied textiles,
her palace was the first to choose."
00:13:27.000,00:13:27.910,这些小事,,,
00:13:28.240,00:13:30.030,让一让她又有什么要紧,00:13:28.129,00:13:29.184,These are minor matters.
00:13:30.520,00:13:31.190,还有,00:13:29.184,00:13:31.360,What's the harm in letting her have her way?
00:13:31.400,00:13:33.910,外面庭院里的牡丹都有些歪了,00:13:31.746,00:13:35.160,The peonies in the yard look a bit askew.
00:13:34.280,00:13:35.750,叫花匠好好培培土,,,
00:13:36.040,00:13:37.550,明年春天还要开花的,00:13:35.400,00:13:38.673,"Tell the gardeners the compact the soil,
so the blossoms will come back in the spring."
00:13:38.080,00:13:38.830,娘娘,,,
00:13:39.960,00:13:40.910,娘娘母仪天下,00:13:39.060,00:13:40.366,But Your Majesty...
00:13:41.560,00:13:42.590,会跟她一般计较吗,00:13:41.000,00:13:43.840,"Her Majesty is the Mother of the Nation.
Why should Her Majesty be bothered?"
00:13:49.840,00:13:50.750,流朱呢,,,
00:13:52.000,00:13:52.950,小主忘了,00:13:50.900,00:13:52.331,Where's Vermilion?
00:13:53.520,00:13:55.590,早上的时候小主嘱咐小厨房,00:13:53.180,00:13:58.060,"My Lady, you ordered our kitchen to make some pastries
to send to Lady Shen and Companion An."
00:13:55.920,00:13:56.900,要做一些小点心,,,
00:13:57.680,00:13:59.980,让流朱给沈贵人和安答应送去,,,
00:14:00.320,00:14:02.030,这不 刚走了一会儿呢,00:13:58.700,00:14:03.280,Vermilion has just got on her way to deliver them.
00:14:03.040,00:14:03.990,启禀小主,,,
00:14:04.880,00:14:06.590,皇后身边的剪秋姑姑,,,
00:14:06.840,00:14:08.190,给您送东西来了,00:14:04.302,00:14:09.585,"My Lady, Madam Autumn sent gifts to you
on behalf of Her Majesty the Empress."
00:14:09.240,00:14:12.710,请您三日后卯时到景仁宫觐见,00:14:10.160,00:14:14.120,"You are required to greet Her Majesty in the
Palace of Great Benevolence at the fourth hour in three days."
00:14:13.080,00:14:13.870,知道了,00:14:14.120,00:14:15.320,I understand.
00:14:14.200,00:14:17.430,还有 翊坤宫首领太监周公公,00:14:15.380,00:14:20.220,"Also, the head eunuch of the Palace of Earthly Honor,
Mr. Zhou, is waiting outside."
00:14:18.000,00:14:19.350,在外边候着呢,,,
00:14:19.640,00:14:20.670,翊坤宫,00:14:20.500,00:14:22.220,Palace of Earthly Honor?
00:14:21.640,00:14:23.150,华妃娘娘宫里的,00:14:22.715,00:14:24.500,That's Consort Fleur's palace.
00:14:27.120,00:14:27.950,我即刻就来,00:14:24.600,00:14:25.687,I see.

- Aye."
00:14:31.400,00:14:34.830,小主 华妃与皇后分庭抗礼,00:14:32.360,00:14:37.600,"My Lady, Consort Fleur is on a par with Her Majesty.
You cannot show any disrespect."
00:14:35.080,00:14:36.350,小主千万不能怠慢,,,
00:14:39.520,00:14:41.390,您老长时间没来了,00:14:40.860,00:14:42.720,"It's very nice to see you, sir."
00:14:46.080,00:14:46.790,您请,00:14:47.000,00:14:48.140,Please.

00:14:54.080,00:14:57.310,华妃娘娘命奴才给您送些礼物来,00:14:55.480,00:14:58.647,Her Highness Consort Fleur sends you some gifts.
00:15:00.000,00:15:01.110,多谢娘娘美意,,,
00:15:01.800,00:15:04.100,有劳公公向娘娘转达嫔妾的谢意,00:15:01.020,00:15:05.400,"I thank Her Highness for her generous thought.
Please extend my gratitude to Her Highness."
00:15:05.360,00:15:06.630,公公坐下喝杯茶吧,,,
00:15:07.800,00:15:09.230,辜负莞常在盛情,00:15:06.200,00:15:08.520,"Would you like to sit down for some tea, sir?"
00:15:09.760,00:15:11.230,咱们娘娘规矩严,00:15:08.979,00:15:10.722,"I regret to decline your kindness, My Lady."
00:15:11.800,00:15:14.360,奴才呢 还得给别的小主送赏去,00:15:10.760,00:15:15.473,"Her Highness has strict rules on us.
I have to visit other concubines."
00:15:14.600,00:15:16.390,所以也不敢多耽误了,00:15:15.699,00:15:17.602,I'm afraid I must go now.
00:15:17.000,00:15:17.980,那就有劳公公了,00:15:18.020,00:15:19.554,"Thank you for coming, sir."
00:15:26.880,00:15:28.230,小主没有别的盼咐,,,
00:15:28.600,00:15:29.990,那奴才告退,00:15:27.920,00:15:31.367,"My Lady, if there's nothing else I can help you with,
I will take my leave."
00:15:34.960,00:15:35.870,恭喜小主,,,
00:15:36.400,00:15:38.990,华妃娘娘对小主青眼有加,00:15:36.000,00:15:40.169,"Congratulations, My Lady.
Her Highness showed great appreciation for you."
00:15:42.080,00:15:43.630,这些东西一时也用不着,,,
00:15:43.960,00:15:45.470,先登记了收入库房吧,00:15:43.264,00:15:46.974,"These won't come into use for the time being.
Please keep a record and put them in the storeroom."
00:15:45.880,00:15:46.550,是,00:15:46.974,00:15:47.840,Yes.
00:15:50.720,00:15:51.860,原来沈贵人的赏赐,,,
00:15:52.200,00:15:53.230,和小主的一样多,00:15:51.820,00:15:54.534,"My Lady, you received as many gifts as Lady Shen."
00:15:53.800,00:15:55.070,安答应的延禧宫,,,
00:15:55.320,00:15:57.510,也只有富察贵人和夏常在才有呢,00:15:54.873,00:15:59.070,"In Companion An's palace,
only Lady Fuca and Attendant Xia received gifts."
00:15:58.840,00:16:00.230,华妃娘娘这样厚赏,,,
00:16:00.720,00:16:02.230,恐怕是看谁有来历,00:15:59.980,00:16:01.995,Consort Fleur sent generous rewards.
00:16:02.800,00:16:03.910,故意在拉拢吧,00:16:01.995,00:16:05.400,"She must be trying to win over the new concubines
based on their backgrounds."
00:16:33.960,00:16:35.590,奴婢剪秋给小主请安,00:16:35.029,00:16:37.070,Peace to Attendant Xia.
00:16:36.920,00:16:38.060,您怎么亲自来了,,,
00:16:38.320,00:16:39.870,快请进快请进 来,00:16:37.631,00:16:39.442,"Madam Autumn, you shouldn't have visited personally."
,,,00:16:39.442,00:16:41.100,Please come in!
00:16:47.240,00:16:48.270,皇后娘娘想啊,,,
00:16:48.480,00:16:50.150,小主们初来宫中怕不习惯,00:16:48.220,00:16:51.480,Her Majesty was hoping all new concubines can settle in comfortably.
00:16:50.480,00:16:52.270,所以特地让奴婢过来看看,,,
00:16:52.560,00:16:53.670,还顺便让奴婢带了些,00:16:51.592,00:16:53.360,So she sent me to check on everyone.
00:16:54.000,00:16:55.190,江南织造局进贡的料子,,,
00:16:55.560,00:16:56.310,带给夏常在,00:16:53.600,00:16:57.440,"And to also bring over some textiles,
which are the tributes from Southern Clothing Services."
00:16:56.560,00:16:58.790,皇后厚爱 还让姑姑亲自送来,,,
00:16:59.160,00:17:00.110,真是荣幸,00:16:57.620,00:17:01.080,"Her Majesty favors me and sent you to visit me personally.
I am extremely flattered!"
00:17:00.480,00:17:02.710,小主客气了那奴婢告辞了,00:17:01.360,00:17:03.960,It's my pleasure. Allow me to take my leave.
00:17:03.240,00:17:04.070,姑姑慢走啊,,,
00:17:04.680,00:17:05.710,小主留步吧,00:17:04.280,00:17:05.536,"Take care, Madam."
,,,00:17:05.800,00:17:07.240,"Goodbye, My Lady."
00:17:18.920,00:17:20.310,出身微贱呢,,,
00:17:20.600,00:17:22.710,就别怪别人都不待见你,00:17:20.000,00:17:24.160,"Don't fault others for ignoring you.
You were born poor and humble."
00:17:25.080,00:17:28.510,这点赏赐真叫人寒酸哪,00:17:26.269,00:17:29.820,Are those all the miserable gifts you received?
00:17:37.800,00:17:39.630,华妃娘娘赏的东西再好,,,
00:17:39.920,00:17:41.550,那也不如皇后娘娘的,00:17:38.980,00:17:42.980,"Consort Fleur's gifts are good,
but incomparable to Her Majesty's."
00:17:43.240,00:17:44.670,把皇后娘娘赏的料子,,,
00:17:45.000,00:17:45.980,赶一身衣裳出来,00:17:44.180,00:17:47.601,Make a dress with the textile from Her Majesty in three days.
00:17:47.000,00:17:48.470,等合宫觐见的时候,,,
00:17:48.720,00:17:51.630,我穿上了再去给皇后娘娘谢恩,00:17:47.978,00:17:53.017,"I will thank Her Majesty in that dress
when the harem pays respects to her."
00:17:53.280,00:17:54.030,是,,,
00:17:57.840,00:17:59.670,小主你别跟她一般见识,00:17:58.940,00:18:01.200,"Don't be bothered by Attendant Xia, My Lady."
00:18:01.680,00:18:05.270,我人微言轻 夏常在没说错,00:18:02.840,00:18:06.200,"My humble being carries no weight.
She wasn't wrong."
00:18:05.680,00:18:08.470,小主你别灰心 英雄不问出处,00:18:06.820,00:18:09.783,"Don't lose heart, My Lady.
Your origin doesn't determine your future."
00:18:15.080,00:18:17.670,小主 淳常在到了,00:18:16.220,00:18:18.840,"My Lady, Attendant Chun is here."
00:18:18.160,00:18:18.870,快请,00:18:18.840,00:18:20.280,Please come in!

00:18:23.880,00:18:25.830,我现在才敢过来 不算打扰吧,00:18:23.460,00:18:26.960,"You had a busy day, Sourire.
Hope I'm not disturbing you!"
00:18:26.040,00:18:26.670,怎么会,,,
00:18:27.320,00:18:28.870,本来正打算过去看妹妹呢,,,
00:18:29.160,00:18:31.430,谁知妹妹倒先来了坐,00:18:27.000,00:18:31.280,"Not at all. I was just thinking about visiting you.
But you're here already."
00:18:32.320,00:18:33.300,浣碧 上茶,00:18:32.000,00:18:33.547,Have a seat.

00:18:40.840,00:18:41.900,不知妹妹喝得惯吗,00:18:40.500,00:18:43.240,I have Pu'er tea for today. I hope you like it.
00:18:43.400,00:18:44.070,来,,,
00:18:44.320,00:18:45.950,你这儿有这么多好吃的点心,00:18:44.820,00:18:47.680,You have so many tasty pastries here.
00:18:47.880,00:18:49.190,我晚饭没吃饱,,,
00:18:49.480,00:18:50.990,要不这个茶就先放一放,00:18:48.780,00:18:52.340,I didn't eat enough at dinner. Can I have some pastries first?
00:18:51.400,00:18:52.310,等我点心吃腻了,,,
00:18:52.800,00:18:54.390,我正好用茶压一压,00:18:52.460,00:18:55.560,I'll have the tea later to wash down the starch.
00:18:54.600,00:18:55.350,请,,,

00:19:05.800,00:19:07.790,看着妹妹年纪还小的样子,00:19:06.740,00:19:09.140,You look very young.
00:19:08.080,00:19:10.030,不啊 我都＋四了,00:19:09.140,00:19:11.340,"No, I'm fourteen."
00:19:14.560,00:19:16.030,觉着妹妹不爱喝普洱,,,
00:19:17.120,00:19:18.510,洗碧 换杯牛乳茶来,00:19:15.622,00:19:17.663,You don't seem to like like Pu'er ...
00:19:18.960,00:19:19.670,是,00:19:18.191,00:19:19.844,"Jade, make milk tea."
00:19:19.960,00:19:21.630,谢谢姐姐 我就爱吃甜的,00:19:20.221,00:19:21.012,Yes.

00:19:25.360,00:19:26.630,姐姐叫我淳儿吧,00:19:23.380,00:19:25.321,"Take your time, don't get choked."
00:19:26.960,00:19:27.940,我爹娘都这么叫我,00:19:26.240,00:19:29.000,"Please call me Chun'er.
That's what my parents call me."
00:19:28.120,00:19:28.790,好啊,00:19:29.000,00:19:30.174,Sure.
00:19:30.040,00:19:31.630,你晚饭为何没吃饱啊,00:19:31.000,00:19:33.109,Was there something wrong with your dinner?
00:19:35.000,00:19:36.390,我想爹娘来着,00:19:36.000,00:19:37.754,I was missing home.
00:19:37.880,00:19:39.950,御膳房送来的晚饭是糟鹅,,,
00:19:40.680,00:19:41.270,我就想到,,,
00:19:41.560,00:19:43.190,我娘做的糟鹅是最好吃的,00:19:38.840,00:19:44.360,"The Imperial Kitchen made wine-soaked goose,
and I remembered that my mother's is the best."
00:19:43.720,00:19:44.940,我就吃不下饭了,,,
00:19:45.400,00:19:46.380,以后晚饭没吃饱,00:19:44.620,00:19:46.120,So I felt homesick.
00:19:46.720,00:19:47.630,就上姐姐这儿来吃,00:19:46.480,00:19:48.960,Come here if you don't eat well the next time!
00:19:48.640,00:19:49.270,可以吗,00:19:49.500,00:19:50.600,Can I?
00:19:50.520,00:19:52.270,莞姐姐待淳儿真好,00:19:51.820,00:19:53.691,You're so nice to me!
00:19:55.200,00:19:56.870,听说皇上特别喜欢姐姐,,,
00:19:57.120,00:19:58.340,下午看见送赏赐的人,00:19:56.220,00:19:58.060,I heard His Majesty really likes you.
00:19:58.720,00:19:59.630,一拨拨忙慌慌的,00:19:58.060,00:20:01.102,"When I saw the courtyard packed with people
rushing in gifts this afternoon,"
00:20:00.000,00:20:01.140,就知道这话是真的了,00:20:01.102,00:20:02.386,I knew it must be true.
00:20:02.920,00:20:04.270,我刚得了些时新宫花,,,
00:20:04.600,00:20:05.310,样子挺奇巧,00:20:04.000,00:20:06.582,I received some lovely flower hairpins.
00:20:05.600,00:20:07.390,妹妹若喜欢 就挑两支去戴,00:20:06.582,00:20:08.640,Take some if they catch your eye!
00:20:08.480,00:20:09.230,不用了,00:20:09.400,00:20:10.788,It's all right...
00:20:09.960,00:20:12.830,我还是比较喜欢姐姐这儿的点心,00:20:11.014,00:20:14.127,I like... your pastries more.
00:20:16.040,00:20:16.950,喜欢就多吃点,,,
00:20:17.760,00:20:19.870,浣碧 挑些精致的点心包起来,00:20:16.960,00:20:18.820,Eat as much as you want.
00:20:20.200,00:20:21.180,给淳常在送过去,00:20:18.820,00:20:22.600,"Jade, wrap up some good ones
and send them to Attendan Chun's chamber."
00:20:21.400,00:20:22.030,是,,,
00:20:22.520,00:20:23.230,谢谢姐姐,00:20:22.640,00:20:23.420,Yes.
,,,00:20:23.420,00:20:24.840,"Thank you, Sourire."
,,,00:20:27.280,00:20:35.000,Lotuses are harvested south of River Yangtze....
00:20:35.240,00:20:36.550,御花园果然好看,,,
00:20:37.320,00:20:38.870,什么东西都那么精致,00:20:36.500,00:20:38.406,The Imperial Garden was surely a feast for the eyes.
,,,00:20:38.406,00:20:40.040,Everything was so finely arranged.
00:20:42.720,00:20:44.270,果然是下贱坯子,00:20:43.920,00:20:45.541,What a lowborn woman!
00:20:44.960,00:20:47.310,绣个花都要哼个歌唱个曲,00:20:46.069,00:20:48.420,Are you not able to sew without humming a siren's song?
00:20:48.440,00:20:50.190,这三日是不能侍寝的,,,
00:20:50.680,00:20:52.270,这来日要是能侍寝了,00:20:49.490,00:20:51.820,You cannot serve His Majesty overnight for these three days.
00:20:52.720,00:20:54.350,这还不自己上赶着去呀,00:20:51.820,00:20:53.717,"But when that day arrives,"
00:20:54.920,00:20:55.900,我随口唱的,00:20:53.720,00:20:55.740,won't you sing your way to His Majesty's bed?
,,,00:20:55.740,00:20:57.500,I was singing mindlessly.
00:20:56.400,00:20:59.470,常在若是不喜欢 我不唱就是了,00:20:57.500,00:21:00.500,"Attendant Xia, I will stop if you don't like it."
00:20:59.760,00:21:01.150,少在这儿给我摆可怜样,,,
00:21:01.440,00:21:02.230,给谁看呢,00:21:00.760,00:21:03.260,Don't give me that pitiful face!
00:21:02.600,00:21:03.430,我没有,,,
00:21:03.680,00:21:05.310,如今是还没有见着皇上,00:21:03.540,00:21:04.600,I didn't ...
00:21:05.880,00:21:07.630,这来日要是见着皇上了,00:21:04.800,00:21:08.453,"When you finally see His Majesty one day,
if you ever can,"
00:21:07.920,00:21:09.310,你敢这般狐媚子撒娇,00:21:08.453,00:21:10.604,don't you dare be a minx like this!
00:21:09.880,00:21:10.910,给我小心些,00:21:10.900,00:21:12.425,Not on my watch!
00:21:19.120,00:21:20.180,总是这个样子,,,
00:21:20.520,00:21:21.660,甩脸子给谁看呢,00:21:20.309,00:21:23.329,"Who does she think she is?
Always acting this way."
00:21:23.720,00:21:26.150,小主别跟她一般见识,00:21:24.840,00:21:27.360,"My Lady, don't lower yourself to be like her."
00:21:26.560,00:21:27.350,算了,00:21:27.700,00:21:28.969,Forget it.
00:21:28.320,00:21:30.880,她在这里我出去便是,00:21:29.459,00:21:32.199,"She's here, so I'll go out."
00:21:34.240,00:21:35.750,你陪我去看两位姐姐吧,,,
00:21:36.080,00:21:36.710,是,00:21:35.384,00:21:37.604,Let's go visit my friends.
00:21:38.320,00:21:39.150,好香啊,00:21:39.240,00:21:41.000,"It smells so good,"
00:21:41.320,00:21:42.190,香不香,00:21:42.000,00:21:43.605,doesn't it?
00:21:46.280,00:21:47.190,再摘一枝,00:21:47.000,00:21:48.461,Let's get another one.
00:21:48.480,00:21:50.630,你来了快点进来啊,00:21:48.920,00:21:51.780,"Hey, you're here. Come on in!"
00:21:52.040,00:21:53.310,安小主来了也不通报,,,
00:21:53.640,00:21:55.150,白叫小主在日头底下晒着,00:21:52.960,00:21:56.100,You should have announced the arrival of Lady An!
00:21:55.440,00:21:56.660,若晒坏了可仔细着,00:21:56.100,00:21:57.880,How could you let her wait in the sun?
00:21:56.880,00:21:59.260,姐姐别怪他是我不让传的,00:21:57.880,00:22:00.300,"Don't scold him, Sourire. I asked him not to."
00:22:01.640,00:22:03.150,本想让姐姐们开心,,,
00:22:03.680,00:22:05.590,不料却让姐姐恼了,00:22:02.740,00:22:06.817,"I didn't want to interrupt, but it's my fault you were disturbed nonetheless."
00:22:06.200,00:22:07.230,都是陵容不好,,,
00:22:07.600,00:22:09.230,你是好意哪又错了,00:22:07.156,00:22:08.620,It was thoughtless of me.
,,,00:22:08.620,00:22:10.420,"You have no fault, only good intentions."
00:22:09.760,00:22:11.870,都怪你不好 吓着安妹妹了,00:22:10.680,00:22:12.940,"Huan'er, you're to blame. You scared Lingrong."
00:22:12.120,00:22:14.070,还不快点请进来喝茶赔罪,00:22:13.120,00:22:15.140,You owe her an apology over tea.
00:22:14.360,00:22:16.030,正是呢 快进来 快进来,00:22:15.420,00:22:17.500,Please come in for tea. Come in.
00:22:18.080,00:22:19.950,方才去咸福宫看眉姐姐,,,
00:22:20.280,00:22:22.630,本想与眉姐姐一同来看甄姐姐,00:22:19.000,00:22:23.552,"I went to Meizhuang's palace first,
hoping to come here together with her."
00:22:23.280,00:22:24.990,不料姐姐先过来了,,,
00:22:25.360,00:22:26.340,还是晚了一步,00:22:24.420,00:22:27.180,But she had already left. I came late.
00:22:26.720,00:22:27.550,一点都不晚,,,
00:22:27.760,00:22:29.390,咱们正好一起说说话,00:22:27.689,00:22:30.880,It's not late at all. We can all catch up now that you're here!
00:22:30.240,00:22:32.540,如今啊 我住在咸福宫,,,
00:22:32.920,00:22:33.950,主位敬嫔娘娘,00:22:31.320,00:22:36.740,"The head of my palace, Concubine Estime,
is very kind and easy to talk to."
00:22:34.240,00:22:35.710,是一位很好说话的人,,,
00:22:37.360,00:22:38.470,你那边如何,00:22:38.330,00:22:39.800,How about your palace?
00:22:39.680,00:22:41.910,我那边就这样,00:22:40.800,00:22:43.040,It's... not too bad.
00:22:43.320,00:22:45.950,富察贵人倒不像是个多事的,00:22:44.520,00:22:47.050,Lady Fuca seems all right.
00:22:47.480,00:22:48.870,那位夏常在,00:22:48.440,00:22:50.285,But Attendant Xia...
00:22:51.040,00:22:52.390,我不理她就是了,00:22:52.060,00:22:53.680,I will stay away from her.
00:22:52.840,00:22:54.470,我只管跟姐姐们说话,00:22:53.760,00:22:55.800,I will spend more time with you two.
00:22:56.240,00:22:58.540,那安小主可要常来咱们宫里坐坐,00:22:57.300,00:23:00.000,"My Lady, you are always welcome here."
00:22:59.200,00:23:01.030,我知道小主不爱喝六安茶,,,
00:23:01.280,00:23:02.310,特意换了香片,00:23:00.447,00:23:03.606,"I know you don't like Lu'an tea,
so I prepared jasmine tea for you."
00:23:03.200,00:23:05.270,在姐姐家里住过一段时日,,,
00:23:05.560,00:23:07.710,浣碧倒费心事事都记着,00:23:04.180,00:23:08.880,"After I lived for a few days at your home,
Jade was troubled to remember all my preferences."
00:23:08.680,00:23:11.140,两位小主和我家小主情同姐妹,,,
00:23:11.560,00:23:13.030,奴婢怎敢不用心呢,00:23:09.700,00:23:13.940,"You both treat My Lady as your sister.
I must serve you as best I can."
00:23:13.440,00:23:15.070,我原以为流朱伶俐,,,
00:23:15.360,00:23:18.430,不想这浣碧嘴更巧 心更细呢,00:23:14.380,00:23:19.511,"I thought Vermillion was the quick-witted one.
But Jade has a honeyed mouth and an attentive heart."
00:23:19.360,00:23:20.470,浣碧服侍我久了,,,
00:23:20.720,00:23:22.430,自然比别人多长些记性,00:23:20.400,00:23:23.660,"Jade has been with me all these years.
Naturally, she became more perceptive."
00:23:24.240,00:23:26.870,自然是自幼服侍咱们的好一些,00:23:25.300,00:23:28.016,"Of course, our dowry maids know us the best."
00:23:27.280,00:23:30.270,我这次也是带了采月和采星过来,00:23:28.280,00:23:31.440,I moved in with Lunar and Stellar.
00:23:31.440,00:23:32.270,对了,,,
00:23:32.520,00:23:34.750,你并没有带贴身的宫女过来,00:23:32.559,00:23:35.680,"Lingrong, you didn't bring a dowry maid."
00:23:35.360,00:23:37.470,宫里服侍你的可还好,00:23:36.280,00:23:38.920,How are the servants in your palace?
00:23:39.240,00:23:41.800,宝鹃伶俐 倒很稳妥,00:23:40.180,00:23:43.025,Coua is a competent maid. I can always count on her.
00:23:42.400,00:23:44.910,还有两个小的 也不过＋五,00:23:43.480,00:23:44.872,I have two other maids.
00:23:45.440,00:23:46.990,倒指不上她们做什么,00:23:44.872,00:23:48.200,"They are just fifteen years old, and not as dependable."
00:23:47.680,00:23:49.950,不过还好我素来省事,,,
00:23:50.400,00:23:51.350,倒也无妨,00:23:48.760,00:23:52.780,"But don't worry, I've always been able to take care of myself."
00:23:52.760,00:23:53.470,槿汐,00:23:53.820,00:23:55.060,Jinxi.
00:23:56.080,00:23:56.830,在,,,
00:23:57.560,00:23:58.870,你去回禀皇后娘娘,00:23:57.180,00:23:58.260,Yes.
00:23:59.240,00:24:01.910,把菊青指去延禧宫伺候安小主,00:23:58.500,00:24:03.280,"Please report to Her Majesty that I will send Daisy to
serve Companion An in the Palace of Prolonging Happiness."
00:24:03.040,00:24:03.870,是,00:24:03.993,00:24:04.960,Yes.
00:24:05.280,00:24:07.630,菊青虽年轻 却很敦厚妥当,00:24:06.339,00:24:08.627,Daisy is young but very well-trained.
00:24:07.920,00:24:09.310,等一下就让她跟你回去,,,
00:24:09.800,00:24:10.860,若还有什么不够的,00:24:09.080,00:24:10.753,She will go back to your palace with you.
00:24:11.160,00:24:12.590,尽来告诉我和眉姐姐,00:24:10.880,00:24:13.800,Don't hesitate to tell us if you need anything else.
00:24:13.200,00:24:14.150,多谢姐姐,,,
00:24:14.680,00:24:16.270,今日新得的几匹缎子,00:24:14.220,00:24:15.540,"Thank you, Sourire."
00:24:16.520,00:24:17.710,我看正合你穿,00:24:15.720,00:24:19.060,"The textiles I received today seem suitable
to be made into dresses for you."
00:24:18.000,00:24:20.830,等下我就让采月给你送去延禧宫,00:24:19.100,00:24:22.100,Lunar will bring them to your palace later.
00:24:21.760,00:24:23.430,两位姐姐待我这样好,00:24:22.800,00:24:25.425,Both of you have been so kind to me.
00:24:24.720,00:24:25.670,我无以为报,00:24:25.651,00:24:27.576,I don't know how I can ever repay you.
00:24:29.360,00:24:33.790,这份情谊陵容感激不尽,00:24:30.440,00:24:34.940,I will be eternally grateful for your friendship and help.
00:24:35.480,00:24:37.510,你我姐妹三人一同入宫,,,
00:24:37.800,00:24:38.910,彼此又最熟悉,00:24:36.600,00:24:40.000,We three know each other well and came to the palace together.
00:24:39.480,00:24:41.230,互相照顾是应当的,00:24:40.464,00:24:42.974,It's natural we care for one another like sisters.

00:25:09.640,00:25:11.750,今日是小主第一次觐见皇后,,,
00:25:12.080,00:25:13.060,可要打扮得隆重些,00:25:10.500,00:25:15.545,"My Lady, today is your first time to pay respects to the Empress.
You should dress nicely to stand out."
00:25:13.360,00:25:14.340,才能艳冠群芳呢,,,
00:25:17.200,00:25:18.870,你去外头取些热水来,,,
00:25:19.360,00:25:20.990,这里有浣碧她们伺候就行,00:25:18.504,00:25:22.156,"Please bring me some hot water.
Jade will help me get dressed."
00:25:21.960,00:25:22.590,是,00:25:23.000,00:25:23.844,Yes.
00:25:30.240,00:25:31.630,梳寻常发髻即可,00:25:31.260,00:25:33.000,Do my hair as usual.
00:25:32.320,00:25:32.990,是,00:25:33.264,00:25:34.475,Understood.
00:25:37.920,00:25:40.550,娘娘该去景仁宫了,00:25:38.860,00:25:42.200,"Your Highness, it's time to leave for the Palace of Great Benevolence."
00:25:41.160,00:25:43.350,今儿晚不得呀,00:25:42.200,00:25:44.620,We can't be late today.
00:25:44.360,00:25:45.390,不急,,,
00:25:47.000,00:25:48.270,娘娘匠心独运,00:25:45.500,00:25:47.183,There's no hurry.
00:25:48.720,00:25:50.350,这个发髻格外好看,00:25:47.940,00:25:49.600,Your Highness is uniquely styled.
00:25:50.640,00:25:51.750,又华丽又大方,00:25:49.660,00:25:52.937,"The phoenix coiffure looks exceptionally distinguished.
[Phoenix is equivalent to the emperor's dragon]"
00:25:53.080,00:25:53.910,走吧,00:25:54.120,00:25:55.527,We'll go.
00:25:54.760,00:25:56.630,妹妹们今天都来得这么早,00:25:55.976,00:25:58.260,Our new sisters have all arrived so early.
00:25:57.480,00:25:59.430,在宫里面的生活还习惯吗,00:25:58.640,00:26:01.060,How does everyone find living in the palace?
00:26:00.200,00:26:03.980,承蒙皇后关怀 一切都好,00:26:01.480,00:26:05.320,I thank Your Majesty for asking. All is well.
00:26:08.160,00:26:10.070,本宫来得不算晚吧,00:26:09.000,00:26:11.243,I hope I'm not late.
00:26:12.320,00:26:14.750,给华妃娘娘请安,00:26:13.380,00:26:16.072,Peace to Consort Fleur.
00:26:20.640,00:26:21.910,给皇后请安,,,
00:26:22.160,00:26:23.110,妹妹平身吧,00:26:21.766,00:26:23.220,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:26:27.520,00:26:29.230,华妃妹妹来得这么晚,00:26:23.220,00:26:24.460,Please rise.
00:26:29.520,00:26:31.630,是不是身体有什么不适啊,00:26:28.500,00:26:32.869,Consort Fleur came in late. Were you feeling unwell this morning?
00:26:32.400,00:26:34.860,皇上昨晚上看奏折看晚了,,,
00:26:35.520,00:26:37.270,本宫陪得就晚了点,00:26:33.500,00:26:38.400,"His Majesty was working late last night,
so I accompanied him for a little longer."
00:26:37.840,00:26:41.830,今儿早上皇上偏不让本宫起得早,00:26:39.000,00:26:43.046,"This morning, His Majesty insisted that I get some more rest."
00:26:42.160,00:26:43.630,所以就迟了,00:26:43.046,00:26:44.564,That caused my delay.
00:26:45.360,00:26:47.070,皇后娘娘不生气吧,00:26:46.420,00:26:48.378,I hope it's all right with Your Majesty.
00:26:48.120,00:26:49.750,皇上连日忙于朝政,,,
00:26:50.080,00:26:51.550,难免会疏忽妹妹,00:26:49.170,00:26:52.606,"His Majesty has been tirelessly occupied at court
and may have overlooked you."
00:26:51.840,00:26:53.750,所以要格外疼妹妹一些,00:26:52.908,00:26:55.157,That's why he was making it up to you.
00:26:54.560,00:26:56.670,今日既与诸位新妹妹相见,,,
00:26:56.960,00:26:59.710,往后咱们也多几个做伴之人了,00:26:55.500,00:27:00.781,"Since we welcome the new concubines today,
there will now be more companionship for you."
00:27:05.360,00:27:07.150,这华妃这样声势浩大的,,,
00:27:07.400,00:27:08.350,是做给谁看啊,00:27:06.480,00:27:09.960,"Consort Fleur made quite an entrance.
Who's she trying to impress?"
00:27:13.240,00:27:17.590,众小主向皇后娘娘行叩拜大礼,00:27:14.220,00:27:18.849,"(Jiang Fuhai)
The new concubines will formally bow to Her Majesty."
00:27:50.160,00:27:52.910,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:27:51.000,00:27:54.320,May grace and peace be with Your Majesty.
00:27:53.320,00:27:54.190,都起来吧,,,
00:27:54.920,00:27:56.710,谢皇后娘娘,00:27:54.320,00:27:55.520,All rise.
00:27:57.320,00:27:58.910,也见一见各位嫔妃,00:27:55.960,00:27:58.260,I thank Your Majesty.
00:27:59.640,00:28:01.940,端妃娘娘身体抱恙,00:27:58.360,00:28:00.480,You will now greet the other concubines.
00:28:02.240,00:28:05.270,众位小主今儿怕是见不了了,00:28:00.771,00:28:06.380,"Her Highness Consort Honnête is unwell
and won't receive your greetings today."
00:28:05.880,00:28:07.750,端妃一直身体都不见好,00:28:06.800,00:28:09.240,Her health is not improving.
00:28:08.200,00:28:10.950,等礼毕之后剪秋去瞧瞧,00:28:09.240,00:28:12.000,"Autumn, please visit her after the ceremony."
00:28:11.400,00:28:12.230,是 娘娘,00:28:12.440,00:28:13.927,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:28:13.280,00:28:16.350,众小主参见华妃娘娘,00:28:14.140,00:28:17.534,The new concubines will greet Consort Fleur.
00:28:19.960,00:28:22.590,华妃娘娘万福金安,00:28:21.205,00:28:23.934,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:28:25.000,00:28:27.630,今年内务府送来的翠有些浮了,00:28:25.800,00:28:28.987,The jadeite we received this year is overly light in color.
00:28:28.120,00:28:29.340,一点都不通透,00:28:29.176,00:28:30.534,It lacks quality.
00:28:30.600,00:28:33.190,这好翠是越来越不多见了,00:28:31.820,00:28:34.400,Fine jadeite is becoming increasingly rare.
00:28:33.840,00:28:36.510,妹妹现在的年纪还用不到翡翠,00:28:34.880,00:28:37.885,You are too young for dark-colored jadeite.
00:28:36.840,00:28:38.470,内务府挑给你的翡翠,,,
00:28:38.720,00:28:40.510,颜色自然会青嫩些,00:28:37.885,00:28:41.440,"Naturally, the Household Department selected
the fresher colors appropriate to your age."
00:28:41.000,00:28:43.950,可话说回来妹妹你都如此,,,
00:28:44.680,00:28:46.830,哪里还会有更好的翡翠呢,00:28:42.220,00:28:48.000,"After all, I believe that only the finest jadeite
was selected for the imperial family."
00:28:48.080,00:28:51.150,也是总觉得这翡翠老气了些,00:28:49.120,00:28:52.234,"Of course, I've always considered jadeite too mature."
00:28:51.720,00:28:52.830,臣妾不配戴,00:28:52.910,00:28:54.240,Not suitable for me.
00:28:53.840,00:28:55.790,若皇后娘娘不嫌弃,,,
00:28:56.040,00:28:57.670,臣妾就把这副耳环,,,
00:28:58.200,00:28:59.830,送给皇后娘娘吧,00:28:54.960,00:29:00.938,"If Your Majesty doesn't mind their quality,
I should give my jadeite earrings to Your Majesty."
00:29:00.840,00:29:02.710,本宫新得了一对东珠,,,
00:29:02.920,00:29:04.710,才吩咐制了耳环,00:29:01.860,00:29:05.880,"I have recently received a pair of eastern pearls
and had them made into these earrings."
00:29:05.080,00:29:07.070,若再收妹妹这对耳环,,,
00:29:07.360,00:29:08.910,岂不是太奢靡了,00:29:06.200,00:29:09.680,I'm afraid I shall not be extravagant.
00:29:10.120,00:29:12.750,让皇上知道的话定会不高兴的,00:29:11.200,00:29:14.160,His Majesty wouldn't appreciate that if he knew.
00:29:15.200,00:29:16.910,皇后果然节俭,00:29:16.340,00:29:18.347,I admire Your Majesty's frugality.
00:29:19.600,00:29:21.980,好了 先让诸位妹妹起来吧,00:29:20.840,00:29:23.360,"All right, you should let them rise."
00:29:23.520,00:29:26.510,光顾着跟皇后说话了,,,
00:29:26.760,00:29:28.590,都忘了你们还拘着礼呢,00:29:24.640,00:29:29.160,"Oh, I was so absorbed in conversing with the Empress."
00:29:29.560,00:29:30.470,起来吧,00:29:30.600,00:29:31.900,All rise.
00:29:31.080,00:29:32.990,谢华妃娘娘,00:29:32.240,00:29:34.260,I thank Your Highness.
00:29:34.320,00:29:36.830,有一位夏常在听说很能干,00:29:35.500,00:29:37.740,I've heard that Attendant Xia is quite capable.
00:29:38.320,00:29:40.670,华妃娘娘万福金安,,,
00:29:41.560,00:29:44.150,嫔妾就是常在夏氏,00:29:39.260,00:29:44.960,"Peace to Your Highness.
I am the Attendant from the Xia family."
00:29:45.120,00:29:46.870,夏常在很会打扮,00:29:46.220,00:29:48.080,You are very well-attired.
00:29:47.520,00:29:49.070,这身料子很贵吧,00:29:48.560,00:29:50.460,Your dress must be expensive.
00:29:51.840,00:29:55.270,这个是皇后娘娘赏的料子,00:29:52.800,00:29:56.373,This was made from Her Majesty's awards.
00:29:55.960,00:29:58.630,今日觐见 嫔妾特意穿上,00:29:57.014,00:30:00.321,I'm wearing it for this special occasion today.
00:30:00.000,00:30:03.430,倒知道知恩图报 是个有心的人,00:30:01.000,00:30:04.420,"That's very thoughtful.
You are a grateful recipient of favors."
00:30:04.240,00:30:05.190,起来吧,,,
00:30:05.400,00:30:06.430,谢华妃娘娘,00:30:05.349,00:30:06.440,Rise.
00:30:07.960,00:30:10.630,沈贵人和莞常在又是哪两位,00:30:06.440,00:30:08.014,I thank Your Highness.
00:30:11.120,00:30:13.950,嫔妾咸福宫贵人沈眉庄,00:30:08.986,00:30:12.126,And which are Lady Shen and Attendant Sourire?
00:30:14.200,00:30:15.630,参见华妃娘娘,00:30:12.240,00:30:16.520,"Shen Meizhuang from the Palace of Universal Happiness
bows before Your Highness."
00:30:15.840,00:30:17.750,嫔妾碎玉轩常在甄嬛,,,
00:30:18.000,00:30:19.140,参见华妃娘娘,00:30:16.780,00:30:20.480,"Zhen Huan from the Palace of Pearl Jade
bows before Your Highness."
00:30:21.760,00:30:23.390,沈贵人好雅清,00:30:22.800,00:30:25.160,Lady Shen carries an air of elegance.
00:30:24.880,00:30:27.470,莞常在虽然穿得简单了点,,,
00:30:28.280,00:30:29.830,但是难掩姿色,00:30:25.900,00:30:30.889,And Attendant Sourire's modest dress cannot hide her beauty.
00:30:32.200,00:30:34.470,皇上真的是慧眼识珠,,,
00:30:34.840,00:30:36.510,个个都这么出众,00:30:33.490,00:30:37.629,His Majesty has a keen eye to discern the real pearls.
00:30:40.320,00:30:41.950,行了都起来吧,00:30:41.400,00:30:43.300,"All right, you may rise."
00:30:42.280,00:30:43.750,谢华妃娘娘,00:30:43.420,00:30:44.911,I thank Your Highness.
00:30:46.240,00:30:47.710,娘娘国色天香,,,
00:30:48.000,00:30:49.510,才是真正令人瞩目,00:30:47.284,00:30:50.500,"Your Highness has ""the face of a peony""
and truly captivating beauty."
00:30:49.760,00:30:51.070,嫔妾萤火之光,,,
00:30:51.360,00:30:53.430,如何敢与娘娘明珠争辉,00:30:50.680,00:30:54.860,"We are pale as candlelight
when compared to the radiance of Your Highness."
00:30:54.280,00:30:56.790,沈妹妹一张小嘴倒是挺甜的,00:30:55.380,00:30:58.100,"That is very sweet of you, Lady Shen."
00:30:57.480,00:31:00.190,不过说到国色天香,00:30:58.600,00:31:01.471,"But the phrase ""the face of a peony""..."
00:31:02.600,00:31:05.430,这不是形容皇后的词吗,00:31:03.520,00:31:06.949,Isn't it only appropriate for describing an Empress?
00:31:09.360,00:31:11.920,皇后娘娘母仪天下如明月光辉,00:31:10.400,00:31:13.600,"Her Majesty is as beautiful as a mudan peony
[the type of peony that is associated with an empress]"
00:31:12.480,00:31:15.150,华妃娘娘国色天香似明珠璀璨,00:31:13.600,00:31:16.520,while Your Highness has the splendor of a shaoyao peony.
00:31:15.560,00:31:17.270,臣妾等望尘莫及,00:31:16.709,00:31:19.049,We are incomparably inferior.
00:31:24.880,00:31:28.270,宫中口齿伶俐之人是越来越多了,00:31:26.000,00:31:29.290,Now we have even more sweethearts in the palace.
00:31:32.400,00:31:34.860,诸位妹妹自然都是聪明伶俐的,00:31:33.500,00:31:36.140,Every one of you is certainly sweet and intelligent.
00:31:35.360,00:31:36.670,往后同在宫中,,,
00:31:36.920,00:31:39.030,一则要尽心尽力侍奉皇上,,,
00:31:39.280,00:31:40.990,为皇家延绵子孙,00:31:36.460,00:31:42.080,"Residing in the palace, not only should you serve His Majesty
wholeheartedly and expand the imperial family,"
00:31:41.400,00:31:44.350,二来也要同心同德 和睦相处,00:31:42.460,00:31:45.472,but also live in harmony and unity.
00:31:44.800,00:31:46.590,不得生出争风吃醋之事,,,
00:31:46.920,00:31:48.060,惹皇上烦心,00:31:45.736,00:31:49.526,"You must not displease His Majesty
with any conflicts and jealous rivalries."
00:31:48.520,00:31:49.430,是,00:31:49.677,00:31:50.742,Yes.
00:31:50.840,00:31:53.270,江福海 太后那边怎么说,00:31:51.860,00:31:54.260,"Jiang Fuhai, is the Empress Dowager expecting us?"
00:31:53.480,00:31:56.590,太后娘娘说新小主入宫是喜事,,,
00:31:56.840,00:31:58.870,众位的心意也都知道了,00:31:54.500,00:32:00.040,"The Empress Dowager extended her delight over the new concubines' arrival
and acknowledged their wishes to pay her respects."
00:31:59.240,00:32:00.790,太后要静心礼佛,,,
00:32:01.120,00:32:02.910,请娘娘和众位小主,00:32:00.220,00:32:02.400,Her Majesty is paying homage to the Buddha.
00:32:03.200,00:32:05.310,就不用去寿康宫请安了,00:32:02.400,00:32:06.333,"Your Majesty need not lead the concubines
to the Palace of Longevity."
00:32:05.480,00:32:06.310,好,00:32:06.333,00:32:07.365,I understand.
00:32:06.760,00:32:09.590,今天你们都累了就跪安吧,00:32:07.900,00:32:10.760,You all must be tired. You may kneel and take leave.
00:32:10.160,00:32:13.430,是臣妾告退,00:32:11.320,00:32:14.640,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:32:29.440,00:32:31.820,两位姐姐真是口齿伶俐啊,00:32:30.302,00:32:33.131,That was quite a show! You both have a way with words.
00:32:32.600,00:32:35.060,奉承完皇后又开始巴结华妃,00:32:33.403,00:32:36.500,"You ingratiated yourselves with Consort Fleur
right after pleasing the Empress."
00:32:35.360,00:32:37.430,像搭戏台子似的左右逢源,00:32:36.500,00:32:38.880,It was like watching two actors on a stage.
00:32:37.720,00:32:39.510,真是叫人佩服啊,00:32:38.880,00:32:40.681,How I admire your skills!
00:32:43.000,00:32:44.310,给夏常在请安,00:32:44.044,00:32:45.962,Peace to Attendant Xia.
00:32:49.600,00:32:53.300,两位姐姐让奴才们拿那么多赏赐,00:32:50.689,00:32:56.549,"You have a brigade of servants carrying your gifts.
Is there enough space in your palace for all these awards?"
00:32:53.840,00:32:55.510,这宫里放得下吗,,,
00:32:56.440,00:32:59.710,天家恩德 众姐妹应该同享才是,00:32:57.400,00:33:01.115,The imperial favors should be shared among the entire family.
00:33:00.440,00:33:01.630,我正想回到宫中,,,
00:33:01.920,00:33:04.430,让人挑些好的送去各位姐妹宫里,00:33:01.643,00:33:05.718,"I was just thinking of having the quality items
distributed among the other concubines."
00:33:04.840,00:33:06.510,不想夏妹妹先到,,,
00:33:06.760,00:33:09.270,那就先挑些喜欢的留着赏玩吧,00:33:05.940,00:33:10.523,"Since you are already here,
why don't you be the first one to choose?"
00:33:10.400,00:33:12.070,请夏常在先挑选,00:33:11.491,00:33:13.784,"Please have a look, Attendant Xia."
00:33:13.400,00:33:16.510,这些赏玩之物我夏家还不缺,00:33:14.320,00:33:17.600,My family is never lacking such trinkets.
00:33:19.760,00:33:22.710,只是沈贵人这小恩小惠,00:33:20.975,00:33:24.303,But I can see that Lady Shen
00:33:23.480,00:33:26.430,看来还真是会邀买人心啊,00:33:24.642,00:33:27.433,is very good at winning over people's hearts.
00:33:30.600,00:33:32.190,这样德行的人也配入宫,,,
00:33:32.560,00:33:34.270,当真一副空皮囊而已,00:33:31.882,00:33:35.686,"How could someone with her manners be selected?
Her head is no more than an empty vessel."
00:33:34.760,00:33:37.350,夏家这样的人到咱们年府跟前,,,
00:33:37.600,00:33:38.820,连提鞋都不配,00:33:35.939,00:33:39.900,The Xias are not even worthy of carrying shoes for our Nian family.
00:33:39.560,00:33:42.020,奴婢听说前几日在延禧宫里,,,
00:33:42.320,00:33:43.790,她天天去烦富察贵人,00:33:40.500,00:33:44.949,I've heard that she has caused much chaos in the Palace of Prolonging Happiness.
00:33:44.080,00:33:45.710,还处处给安答应脸色瞧,,,
00:33:46.000,00:33:47.310,闹得鸡犬不宁,00:33:44.949,00:33:48.586,"She has been a bother to Lady Fuca
and giving Companion An a hard time."
00:33:48.960,00:33:51.030,瞧她穿的那身衣裳,00:33:50.215,00:33:51.973,You see her dress.
00:33:51.840,00:33:53.430,以为有皇后撑腰,,,
00:33:53.680,00:33:55.670,就可以在这儿耀武扬威了吗,00:33:52.824,00:33:56.865,"Does she think she can swagger around the palace
wearing the Empress's favor on her back?"
00:33:58.040,00:34:00.230,听闻夏姐姐出身骁勇世家,,,
00:34:00.560,00:34:01.780,妹妹好生景仰,00:33:59.182,00:34:02.971,"Attendant Xia, I heard that you come from a valiant and noble family."
00:34:02.880,00:34:05.590,我家世代骁勇 为国尽忠,00:34:03.915,00:34:07.015,My family has generations of gallant warriors serving the nation.
00:34:06.560,00:34:08.310,岂是你一介县丞可比,00:34:07.540,00:34:10.060,How can a village magistrate compare to us?
00:34:09.640,00:34:12.430,选秀那日冒犯姐姐纯属无心,00:34:11.000,00:34:14.341,My offense on the Selection day was unintentional.
00:34:14.000,00:34:17.270,妹妹后来回去日思夜想后悔不已,00:34:15.171,00:34:18.378,I have reflected upon it with deep remorse.
00:34:18.280,00:34:22.430,只是妹妹想姐姐出身武家,00:34:19.419,00:34:25.380,"I believe, given your family upbringing,
you must have an outstanding martial heritage."
00:34:22.880,00:34:24.350,必定文武双全,,,
00:34:24.680,00:34:26.510,果真姐姐如此骁勇,,,
00:34:27.080,00:34:28.390,不失家门风范,00:34:25.740,00:34:29.760,"I was impressed by your demeanor, like a soldier.
You honor your family's noble reputation."
00:34:28.880,00:34:30.990,我家家训向来如此,00:34:29.960,00:34:32.207,I must live up to my family's teaching.
00:34:33.560,00:34:35.790,世上竟有如此愚笨之人,00:34:34.480,00:34:37.298,It's baffling to find such foolishness under Heaven.
00:34:36.320,00:34:38.110,竟然还封为常在,00:34:37.487,00:34:39.751,And she was granted the title of Attendant.
00:34:39.120,00:34:41.190,常在这里惹人笑话吧,00:34:40.200,00:34:42.427,"Did she ""attend"" school at all?"
00:34:43.080,00:34:43.830,嗻,,,
00:34:54.240,00:34:56.190,她与你同为嫔妃 你怎能打她,00:34:54.038,00:34:55.302,Stop!
,,,00:34:55.302,00:34:57.436,You cannot beat a concubine of His Majesty!
00:35:04.280,00:35:05.190,放开,00:35:05.280,00:35:06.349,Let go!
00:35:09.040,00:35:10.950,华妃娘娘万福金安,00:35:10.189,00:35:12.469,Peace and grace to Your Highness.
00:35:13.920,00:35:14.950,华妃娘娘,,,
00:35:15.440,00:35:16.350,周宁海,00:35:15.024,00:35:16.604,Your Highness.
00:35:16.640,00:35:17.030,嗻,,,
00:35:17.320,00:35:18.150,放开她,00:35:16.604,00:35:18.080,"- Zhou Ninghai.
- Yes."
00:35:21.360,00:35:23.740,秋来御花园风景如画,00:35:18.080,00:35:19.291,It's all right.
00:35:24.000,00:35:26.750,好好的景致却被人给打扰了,00:35:22.564,00:35:27.664,"The Imperial Garden in autumn is as lovely as a painting.
But my peaceful stroll has been disrupted."
00:35:27.200,00:35:28.710,真是扫兴,00:35:28.140,00:35:30.020,How disappointing!
00:35:29.720,00:35:31.710,安答应她出言不逊,00:35:30.764,00:35:33.080,Companion An verbally offended me.
00:35:32.160,00:35:34.540,嫔妾只是想训诫她一下而已,00:35:33.160,00:35:35.660,I only wanted to discipline her.
00:35:35.080,00:35:36.140,训诫一下,00:35:35.989,00:35:37.319,No offense meant.
00:35:37.560,00:35:39.860,皇后与本宫都不在了吗,00:35:38.640,00:35:41.460,Are neither I nor the Empress any longer in the palace?
00:35:40.480,00:35:42.230,本宫竟不知这后宫,,,
00:35:42.480,00:35:44.070,已是夏常在当家,,,
00:35:44.560,00:35:46.670,要辛苦你来训诫宫嫔,00:35:41.540,00:35:47.688,"I didn't know that Attendant Xia had taken over the household
and the responsibility of disciplining concubines."
00:35:47.920,00:35:51.620,本宫怕你承担不起这份辛苦,00:35:49.020,00:35:52.781,I'm afraid this is too much of a burden to bear.
00:35:54.400,00:35:56.910,今年的枫叶好像不够红啊,00:35:55.460,00:35:58.170,The maple trees are not vibrantly red this year.
00:35:59.360,00:36:00.270,奴婢听说,,,
00:36:00.520,00:36:03.550,那枫叶要鲜血染就才红得好看,00:36:00.240,00:36:04.500,"Your Highness, I heard that the maple leaves
become truly stunning when dyed with fresh blood."
00:36:03.800,00:36:04.590,是吗,00:36:04.640,00:36:05.831,Is that so?
00:36:05.520,00:36:07.950,那就赏夏常在一丈红吧,00:36:06.420,00:36:09.100,"I shall reward Attendant Xia with ""Three Yards of Red""."
00:36:08.360,00:36:09.580,就算用她的血,,,
00:36:10.000,00:36:12.430,为宫里的枫叶积点颜色,00:36:09.100,00:36:13.486,So that her blood can add crimson hues to the maple leaves.
00:36:12.960,00:36:13.870,一丈红,,,
00:36:14.360,00:36:15.340,启禀小主,00:36:13.960,00:36:15.231,"""Three Yards of Red""?"
00:36:15.680,00:36:17.590,一丈红乃宫中刑罚,00:36:15.231,00:36:18.600,"My Lady is not aware.
""Three Yards of Red"" is a penalty in the palace."

that are two inches thick and five feet long."
00:36:22.280,00:36:24.550,直打到筋骨皆断血肉模糊为止,00:36:23.184,00:36:26.400,Until the flesh and bones are blurred with blood.
00:36:25.200,00:36:26.870,远远看上去鲜红一片,,,
00:36:27.200,00:36:28.950,那颜色叫一漂亮,00:36:26.400,00:36:29.720,"It appears a brilliant, flowing red even from a distance."
00:36:29.280,00:36:31.110,所以叫一丈红,00:36:30.377,00:36:32.600,"Hence the name ""Three Yards of Red""."
00:36:31.960,00:36:34.230,小主请吧,00:36:32.980,00:36:35.820,"My Lady, please proceed."

00:36:44.400,00:36:45.870,小主的血要是真染红了,00:36:43.840,00:36:45.232,"Please spare me, Your Highness."
00:36:46.240,00:36:47.190,御花园的枫叶,00:36:45.232,00:36:48.344,"My Lady, it would be a blessing from past lives"
00:36:47.680,00:36:49.550,那可是上辈子修来的福气呢,00:36:48.570,00:36:51.066,if your blood can truly add color to the imperial trees.
00:36:51.000,00:36:52.390,华妃娘娘饶命啊,00:36:52.000,00:36:53.700,"Please spare me, Your Highness."

00:37:02.520,00:37:05.750,夏氏以下犯上 意在宫中无礼,00:37:03.520,00:37:06.738,Xia disrespected her peers and superior concubines.
00:37:06.000,00:37:07.590,让各位妹妹受惊了,00:37:06.964,00:37:08.964,I hope she didn't give you a scare.
00:37:08.640,00:37:11.830,只是 虽然法不责众,00:37:09.700,00:37:13.371,"Although ""the law doesn't punish the masses,"""
00:37:12.400,00:37:15.350,但此事还是由你们三个人引起的,00:37:13.560,00:37:16.552,the three of you were also involved.
00:37:16.560,00:37:18.310,夏氏咎由自取,,,
00:37:19.040,00:37:21.310,你们也不是省事的,00:37:17.640,00:37:22.260,"She implicated herself by her own actions,
but you three are not exempt from being punished."
00:37:22.920,00:37:24.910,好好闭门思过去吧,00:37:24.160,00:37:26.385,Reflect on yourselves behind closed doors.
00:37:43.400,00:37:45.780,吓死我了 吓死我了,00:37:44.606,00:37:46.860,It made my blood run cold.
00:37:46.160,00:37:49.190,夏氏虽愚蠢狂妄 却罪不至此啊,00:37:47.220,00:37:50.100,"Although Xia is foolish and arrogant,
her actions didn't warrant such a penalty."
00:37:49.720,00:37:52.310,素闻华妃厉害 却不想如此狠辣,00:37:50.769,00:37:54.089,"I've heard of Consort Fleur's power,
but never expected her to be so ruthless."
00:37:55.480,00:37:57.430,华妃让我们回去闭门思过,,,
00:37:57.760,00:37:58.550,这,00:37:56.610,00:37:59.660,Consort Fleur asked us to reflect on our actions...
00:37:58.840,00:38:00.510,只是思过 别怕啊,00:37:59.780,00:38:02.300,It is merely a time for reflection. Don't be afraid.
00:38:01.800,00:38:04.710,姐姐 我们回宫去吧 我害怕,00:38:02.840,00:38:05.980,We should go back to our palaces now. I'm scared.
00:38:05.160,00:38:05.990,我们回去吧,00:38:06.100,00:38:07.400,Let's go.
00:38:09.920,00:38:10.750,出什么事了,00:38:11.000,00:38:12.180,What happened?
00:38:15.240,00:38:16.110,出什么事了,,,
00:38:16.960,00:38:17.870,那那里面有,00:38:16.075,00:38:17.500,What is going on?

00:38:22.280,00:38:24.030,小主 奴才是御花园的,00:38:21.100,00:38:22.141,Yes...
00:38:24.240,00:38:26.150,奉管事的命前来查看御花园,00:38:23.340,00:38:28.220,"My Ladies, I was ordered to check
the water levels in garden wells."
00:38:26.480,00:38:27.460,各个水井是否有水,,,
00:38:27.800,00:38:29.070,没想到刚来到这儿,,,
00:38:29.400,00:38:30.950,就看见井里有有,00:38:28.860,00:38:31.500,But in that well ... I saw...
00:38:31.440,00:38:32.230,我过去看看,00:38:32.420,00:38:33.571,I'll take a look.
00:38:33.040,00:38:35.550,你别去 小心有不干净的东西,00:38:34.120,00:38:36.700,You shouldn't. It might be something foul.
00:38:35.760,00:38:37.310,放心我去瞧瞧就来,00:38:36.700,00:38:38.580,I'll just have a look. Don't worry.
00:38:52.600,00:38:53.870,怎么了怎么了,00:38:54.320,00:38:55.998,What is it?
00:38:55.080,00:38:58.350,不要过去 有死人,00:38:56.300,00:38:57.660,Don't go...
00:38:59.480,00:39:00.270,什么,00:38:58.500,00:38:59.798,It's a dead body.
00:39:09.040,00:39:11.470,回禀娘娘 死的是福子,00:39:10.160,00:39:12.869,"Your Majesty, it was Fuzi."
00:39:11.720,00:39:13.590,是在一口井里被发现的,00:39:12.869,00:39:14.669,Her body was found in a well.
00:39:13.920,00:39:14.630,福子,,,
00:39:15.280,00:39:16.470,怎么好好端端的一个人,00:39:14.820,00:39:15.776,Fuzi?
00:39:16.760,00:39:17.710,会跌在井里面呢,00:39:16.260,00:39:18.840,How could she end up dead in a well?
00:39:18.080,00:39:19.220,奴才不知道,,,
00:39:19.480,00:39:22.350,那地儿本就偏僻少有人去,00:39:19.100,00:39:23.240,I have no idea. The well is located out of the way.
00:39:22.600,00:39:23.550,你当然不知道,,,
00:39:24.000,00:39:25.510,福子是本宫赐给华妃的人,00:39:23.500,00:39:25.019,"Of course, you wouldn't know."
,,,00:39:25.019,00:39:27.040,I ordered Fuzi to serve Consort Fleur.
00:39:27.920,00:39:28.630,你起来吧,00:39:29.000,00:39:30.000,Rise.
00:39:30.840,00:39:33.590,那奴才去华妃宫中问问,00:39:31.800,00:39:34.856,I will inquire about it in Consort Fleur's palace.
00:39:35.880,00:39:37.430,奴才还有一事回禀,00:39:36.980,00:39:38.731,There is one more thing.
00:39:38.480,00:39:39.270,你说,00:39:39.240,00:39:40.440,Speak.
00:39:39.600,00:39:41.790,华妃娘娘发落了夏常在,00:39:40.620,00:39:43.152,Consort Fleur punished Attendant Xia
00:39:42.440,00:39:43.660,赏了一丈红,00:39:43.642,00:39:45.470,"with ""Three Yards of Red""."
00:39:45.600,00:39:48.030,夏氏不安分发落就发落吧,00:39:46.740,00:39:49.460,Xia misbehaved. She has to face the consequences.
00:39:49.160,00:39:50.590,可怜福子一条人命,,,
00:39:50.920,00:39:52.060,也死得不明不白,00:39:50.260,00:39:53.407,What a pity Fuzi has lost her life to unknown causes.
00:39:52.600,00:39:54.230,更何况是个不懂事的人,00:39:53.709,00:39:55.558,She was an innocent maid.
00:39:57.240,00:39:58.380,长街也没有啊,,,
00:39:58.640,00:39:59.950,知道了知道了走走走,00:39:58.300,00:39:59.740,I couldn't find her anywhere!
00:40:05.800,00:40:06.940,小主这是去哪儿了,00:39:59.780,00:40:01.160,"Understood. Go, go."

00:40:09.240,00:40:10.750,怎么脸色不好啊小主,00:40:10.259,00:40:12.400,"Why do you look unwell, My Lady?"
00:40:12.160,00:40:12.910,快坐下,00:40:13.182,00:40:14.633,Please sit down.
00:40:15.080,00:40:15.830,小主,,,
00:40:16.240,00:40:18.430,刚才江福海过来传了皇后懿旨,00:40:16.000,00:40:19.360,"My Lady, Jiang Fuhai came to deliver a decree from the Empress."
00:40:18.840,00:40:19.710,说从明晚起,,,
00:40:19.960,00:40:22.670,新小主们便要预备着侍寝了,00:40:19.811,00:40:23.742,"Starting from tomorrow, the new concubines
can expect to serve His Majesty."
00:40:23.760,00:40:25.670,恭喜小主贺喜小主,00:40:24.900,00:40:27.040,"Congratulations, My Lady!"
00:40:26.120,00:40:29.030,咱们小主一定是头份的恩宠啊,00:40:27.120,00:40:30.420,You will definitely be the first to receive His Majesty's favors.
00:40:29.920,00:40:32.220,小主也未必明日就被翻牌子,,,
00:40:32.640,00:40:34.940,只是也是要预备着了,00:40:30.980,00:40:36.000,"Not necessarily tomorrow, My Lady,
but you should be prepared."
00:40:35.160,00:40:35.990,是是是,00:40:36.000,00:40:37.360,Yes. Yes.
00:40:37.320,00:40:38.870,小主没吃饭呢吧,00:40:38.360,00:40:40.000,"Are you feeling hungry, My Lady?"
00:40:39.720,00:40:41.950,怕是饿了 快传膳,00:40:40.895,00:40:43.329,Ask them to serve the meal immediately.
00:40:43.440,00:40:44.150,不必了,00:40:44.400,00:40:45.760,No need.
00:40:47.240,00:40:48.030,我没胃口,00:40:48.120,00:40:49.740,I have no appetite.
00:40:51.440,00:40:52.750,那就晚点用膳吧,,,
00:40:53.080,00:40:54.030,我们先扶小主进去,00:40:52.469,00:40:55.489,My Lady will eat later. I will help her get rested.
00:40:59.200,00:41:01.270,娘娘 江福海来了,00:41:00.000,00:41:02.511,"Your Highness, Jiang Fuhai is here."
00:41:01.720,00:41:04.070,说有话要替皇后问娘娘,00:41:02.699,00:41:04.981,He has something to ask on behalf of the Empress.
00:41:06.520,00:41:07.430,叫他进来,,,
00:41:07.960,00:41:08.590,嗻,00:41:07.584,00:41:08.743,Show him in.
00:41:16.880,00:41:18.100,参见娘娘,00:41:08.894,00:41:09.935,Yes.
00:41:18.400,00:41:19.110,起来吧,00:41:17.871,00:41:19.351,I bow before Your Highness.
,,,00:41:19.351,00:41:20.396,Rise.
00:41:21.080,00:41:23.790,公公来得正好 本宫正要找你,00:41:22.000,00:41:24.960,"Mr. Jiang, what perfect timing.
I was going to send for you."
00:41:24.320,00:41:25.110,是,00:41:25.080,00:41:26.200,Yes.
00:41:25.400,00:41:27.030,那个福子是什么来头啊,00:41:26.340,00:41:28.275,What's the background of this Fuzi?
00:41:27.680,00:41:29.510,本宫说都不能说一句,00:41:28.577,00:41:30.702,She's got quite an attitude.
00:41:29.880,00:41:32.710,不过是个奴才 哪有什么来头,00:41:30.966,00:41:32.486,Your Highness must be jesting.
00:41:33.040,00:41:34.100,娘娘说笑了,00:41:32.486,00:41:34.486,A servant doesn't have any noteworthy background.
00:41:34.360,00:41:35.190,说笑,00:41:35.240,00:41:36.580,I'm jesting?
00:41:36.560,00:41:39.590,那好本宫就跟你说笑,00:41:37.580,00:41:40.754,If you want to hear a jest:
00:41:40.600,00:41:44.300,难道福子是仗着背后有皇后撑腰,,,
00:41:44.600,00:41:46.750,故意给本宫脸色瞧吗,00:41:41.622,00:41:47.653,"Is Fuzi disobedient to me
because the Empress is backing her?"
00:41:47.200,00:41:49.660,福子是内务府刚挑上来的,00:41:48.257,00:41:50.857,Fuzi was newly selected by the Household Department.
00:41:49.960,00:41:51.750,皇后娘娘还没留几日,,,
00:41:52.080,00:41:53.190,就赐给了娘娘,00:41:51.083,00:41:54.306,She hardly served Her Majesty before coming here.
00:41:53.440,00:41:56.470,何来皇后娘娘撑腰这一说呢,00:41:54.495,00:41:57.586,"There's no such thing as ""the Empress backing her""."
00:41:56.840,00:41:58.310,那日她给本宫梳妆,,,
00:41:58.760,00:42:00.910,毛手毛脚地扯痛了本宫,00:41:57.777,00:42:01.920,"She pulled at my hair forcibly
when grooming me the other day."
00:42:01.160,00:42:02.670,本宫不过就说了她两句,,,
00:42:02.960,00:42:04.230,她就哭着闹着跑出去,00:42:02.109,00:42:05.320,"I scolded her for that, and she ran away crying."
00:42:04.560,00:42:05.950,到现在都没回来,,,
00:42:06.400,00:42:07.830,本宫还以为,00:42:05.376,00:42:07.384,She hasn't returned since.
00:42:08.440,00:42:11.710,这是皇后宫里教出来的规矩,00:42:07.400,00:42:12.640,"I thought such were the rules she was taught
in the Empress's palace."
00:42:13.200,00:42:16.550,娘娘 福子已经死了,00:42:14.339,00:42:17.580,"Your Highness, Fuzi is dead."

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.000,00:42:59.000,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water
or flowers seen through mist - floating and drifting."

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.000,00:43:19.000,"The joyous sounds you brought;

A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

But you hurt me from head to toe.",00:43:36.000,00:43:54.000,"With affection, I pleased;

Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

and I ended up a fool of my destiny.",00:43:54.000,00:44:02.000,"My wish ran against my will.
Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.000,00:44:33.000,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
But the unsparing northern winds carry snow and rain
to destroy the aspirations of the plum tree."
