00:02:25.020,00:02:27.550,这是太医院为小主所制的纤润膏,00:02:25.031,00:02:28.620,"My Lady, this ointment was specifically
made for you by the Imperial Infirmary."
00:02:28.480,00:02:29.930,小主就算瘦下来了,00:02:28.620,00:02:30.620,"You have been losing weight, My Lady,"
00:02:30.480,00:02:31.690,皮肉也不能松了,00:02:30.620,00:02:33.030,and this will help keep your skin firm.
00:02:34.860,00:02:36.060,腰上多抹一点儿,00:02:35.000,00:02:36.800,Apply more on my waist.
00:02:40.160,00:02:41.610,小主涂好了,00:02:40.000,00:02:42.264,"I'm finished, My Lady."
00:02:43.740,00:02:46.150,宝鹃你去帮我,00:02:43.480,00:02:46.600,"Coua, help me…"
00:02:47.790,00:02:49.900,小主小主你怎么了,00:02:47.930,00:02:50.554,"My Lady, are you all right?"
00:02:50.750,00:02:52.490,小主小主,00:02:50.890,00:02:53.230,"My Lady, My Lady!"
00:02:56.960,00:02:58.620,安嫔在延禧宫晕倒了,00:02:56.929,00:02:59.587,"Concubine An fainted
in the Palace of Prolonging Happiness."
00:03:01.390,00:03:02.420,太医去瞧了吗,00:03:01.530,00:03:03.429,Has an imperial doctor examined her yet?
00:03:03.100,00:03:05.550,去瞧过了可是走到门口,00:03:03.429,00:03:07.680,"An imperial doctor went to her palace,
but Concubine An did not admit him."
00:03:05.760,00:03:07.250,安嫔却硬是不让进去瞧,,,
00:03:08.430,00:03:10.590,听去请太医的小宫女说,00:03:08.570,00:03:11.410,Concubine An's servant told the imperial doctor
00:03:11.270,00:03:13.560,安嫔是节食过度晕倒的,00:03:11.410,00:03:13.813,"that Concubine An fainted due to her
excessively restricted diet."
00:03:14.190,00:03:15.680,她好好的节食做什么,00:03:14.330,00:03:16.330,Why is she on a diet?
00:03:16.190,00:03:17.930,听说那安嫔自失宠以来,,,
00:03:18.400,00:03:19.770,便日日在无人之处,00:03:16.330,00:03:22.147,"I heard that ever since Concubine An fell out of favor,
she has been secretly practicing ice dancing."
00:03:20.110,00:03:21.440,偷偷地苦练冰嬉,,,
00:03:23.780,00:03:25.190,安陵容也算有心,,,
00:03:25.740,00:03:27.150,竟想到以此来争宠,00:03:23.620,00:03:28.106,"An Lingrong's idea to regain favor by becoming
 an ice dancer shows thoughtfulness."
00:03:29.040,00:03:30.370,历代大清皇帝,,,
00:03:30.620,00:03:31.950,都对冰嬉青睐有加,00:03:29.180,00:03:32.760,"Every emperor of the Great Qing has shown
great appreciation for that art."
00:03:32.620,00:03:34.290,年年都要举办冰嬉演出,00:03:32.760,00:03:35.030,There is a performance on the ice every winter.
00:03:35.460,00:03:39.670,钦定冰嬉摔跤满语骑射,00:03:35.600,00:03:38.160,"Ice dancing is also among the four national customs of the Great Qing,"
00:03:39.970,00:03:41.130,为大清国俗,00:03:38.160,00:03:41.860,"along with the Manchu language,
wrestling, and horseback archery."
00:03:41.720,00:03:43.300,听说先帝的御前侍卫中,,,
00:03:43.680,00:03:46.130,就有通过苦练冰嬉而平步青云的,00:03:41.860,00:03:46.645,"One of the prior emperor's personal guards
gained high status by ice dancing."
00:03:47.060,00:03:49.510,娘娘此番预备如何应对,00:03:47.200,00:03:50.160,How does Your Highness plan to counter this?
00:03:50.020,00:03:53.050,根本就不用应对她这是自寻死路,00:03:50.160,00:03:53.530,"We need not do anything at all.
She is ""seeking the path to her own doom."""
00:03:53.690,00:03:54.720,自寻死路,00:03:53.530,00:03:55.546,The path to her own doom?
00:03:56.440,00:03:58.730,奴婢奴婢愚昧,00:03:56.366,00:03:58.870,"I'm too dull-witted to understand, Your Highness."
00:03:59.740,00:04:01.400,那冰嬉若无童子功的功底,00:03:59.880,00:04:02.720,"One can only succeed in ice dancing
if they are trained since childhood."
00:04:01.700,00:04:02.400,必然不成,,,
00:04:03.160,00:04:04.110,而冰上起舞,,,
00:04:04.950,00:04:07.780,则要求舞者身段轻盈柔若无骨,00:04:03.300,00:04:07.989,"It requires a slender figure, and flexibility -
as if the dancer had no bones."
00:04:08.370,00:04:10.450,这更非是一朝一夕可以练成的,00:04:08.404,00:04:10.890,It cannot be mastered overnight.
00:04:11.460,00:04:12.790,安陵容虽然纤弱,00:04:11.600,00:04:13.350,"Although An Lingrong is delicate,"
00:04:13.670,00:04:15.410,但数年养尊处优下来,00:04:13.350,00:04:17.642,"She is no longer slender
after so many years of luxury in the palace."
00:04:15.790,00:04:17.030,怎还有轻盈之态,,,
00:04:17.880,00:04:19.540,难怪要出节食这一招了,00:04:17.982,00:04:20.000,No wonder she restricted her diet.
00:04:20.130,00:04:21.340,娘娘所言极是,00:04:20.000,00:04:22.166,It is as Your Highness says.
00:04:23.260,00:04:25.670,节食既损容貌又不能立刻见效,00:04:23.400,00:04:26.196,"Dieting will affect her looks, but it takes a long time."
00:04:26.550,00:04:29.140,想来她现在也是心急如焚吧,00:04:26.690,00:04:29.623,She must be burning with anxiety.
00:04:30.680,00:04:32.550,其实倒也有立竿见影的法子,00:04:30.520,00:04:32.960,But there is a way she could get instant results.
00:04:33.390,00:04:34.600,若是有人告诉她,,,
00:04:35.100,00:04:36.560,她必定如获至宝,00:04:33.530,00:04:36.799,"If someone were to tell her,
I'm sure she would feel as if she found treasure."
00:04:37.610,00:04:39.810,那可万万不能让她知晓此法,00:04:37.750,00:04:40.160,Then we must not let her find out about this method.
00:04:40.570,00:04:42.310,咱还偏得让她知道,00:04:40.710,00:04:43.050,"On the contrary, we must let her find out."
00:04:43.570,00:04:45.940,昔年赵飞燕得宠于汉成帝,00:04:43.710,00:04:46.590,"Zhao Feiyan was the ""flying swallow""
favored by Emperor Cheng of Han."
00:04:46.450,00:04:48.400,身段轻盈能作掌上舞,00:04:46.590,00:04:48.840,"She was so delicate that
she could dance on a man's palm."
00:04:48.700,00:04:50.940,便是服用了药物息肌丸的功效,00:04:48.840,00:04:51.504,It was because she used the Flesh Thinning Pill.
00:04:52.330,00:04:53.910,把此物塞到肚脐眼里,00:04:52.470,00:04:54.510,"Place the pill in your belly button,"
00:04:54.370,00:04:55.280,融化到体内,00:04:54.510,00:04:56.140,and it melts into your body.
00:04:56.000,00:04:58.580,可使肌肤胜雪身量轻盈,00:04:56.140,00:04:58.908,"It will make your skin as fair as snow
and your body as light as a swallow."
00:04:59.090,00:05:01.120,容貌格外光彩照人,00:04:59.063,00:05:01.479,Your face will shine with radiance.
00:05:03.130,00:05:06.750,只不过有一味麝香在里头,00:05:02.970,00:05:07.019,But the pill contains musk as an ingredient.
00:05:07.640,00:05:10.500,麝香一味可是大损女子躯体的,00:05:07.780,00:05:11.389,Musk damages women's bodies.
00:05:11.350,00:05:12.680,不仅会使女子不孕,00:05:11.389,00:05:14.232,It not only causes infertility but also
00:05:13.060,00:05:14.140,就算是怀了孕的,,,
00:05:14.640,00:05:16.730,也会使腹中胎儿早早地夭折,00:05:14.633,00:05:17.367,will cause miscarriage in a pregnant woman.
00:05:18.270,00:05:20.140,那安嫔是最懂香料之人,00:05:18.372,00:05:20.543,Concubine An is most knowledgeable about spices.
00:05:20.860,00:05:23.140,此法恐怕瞒不过她,00:05:20.700,00:05:23.513,I fear the musk can't be concealed from her.
00:05:23.570,00:05:27.310,我知道瞒不过她 我也不想瞒她,00:05:23.513,00:05:27.743,"I know that we cannot conceal it,
and I don't want to hide it from her."
00:05:27.860,00:05:29.600,用不用全在于她,00:05:27.743,00:05:30.255,It's her choice whether or not to use the Flesh Thinning Pill.
00:05:30.830,00:05:32.160,不过奴婢倒是听说,,,
00:05:32.540,00:05:33.990,以羊花煮汤洗涤,00:05:30.970,00:05:34.840,I've heard that bathing with golden azalea petals
00:05:34.700,00:05:36.320,可以解麝香的阴毒,00:05:34.840,00:05:37.390,can counteract the yin toxins of musk.
00:05:37.250,00:05:39.990,不知道安嫔会不会也知道此法,00:05:37.390,00:05:40.430,Perhaps Concubine An also knows of this method.
00:05:41.420,00:05:42.630,若真有此神效,00:05:41.560,00:05:43.284,"If that really worked,"
00:05:43.760,00:05:46.340,昔年飞燕合德掌握天下大权,00:05:43.900,00:05:47.400,"then how is it that Feiyan and her sister Hede
possessed supreme power but bore no children?"
00:05:47.260,00:05:48.590,怎么煮尽天下羊花,,,
00:05:48.970,00:05:50.050,也不见她有生育呢,00:05:47.400,00:05:50.953,They were able to bathe with all the golden azalea under Heaven.
00:05:51.180,00:05:54.140,叫她知道也好 只当羊花有效,00:05:51.320,00:05:52.999,It's just as well she knows of this.
00:05:54.560,00:05:56.140,用起来更兵聿无忌惮了,00:05:52.999,00:05:56.829,"If she thinks golden azalea will help,
 she will use the pills even more recklessly."
00:05:57.560,00:05:59.390,息肌丸拿去给安嫔了吗,00:05:57.700,00:05:59.530,Did you give the Flesh Thinning Pills to Concubine An?
00:06:00.730,00:06:02.810,安嫔看见 二话不说就用了,00:06:00.870,00:06:03.040,Yes. She took them without a word.
00:06:03.320,00:06:04.100,她倒听话,00:06:03.246,00:06:04.653,She is quite obedient.
00:06:04.780,00:06:06.020,听说娘娘还没赏她,,,
00:06:06.700,00:06:08.810,她自己就已经悄悄向太医院求了,00:06:04.920,00:06:09.188,"She had already asked the Imperial Infirmary for the pills
before Your Majesty granted them to her."
00:06:09.530,00:06:11.270,看来她倒真的不想要孩子,00:06:09.466,00:06:12.130,It seems she really has given up on having children.
00:06:11.990,00:06:14.610,那不正好嘛 省得咱们费手脚了,00:06:12.130,00:06:14.939,Isn't that wonderful? It saves us much effort.
00:06:15.410,00:06:18.900,是 没孩子的人本宫用着安心,00:06:15.550,00:06:19.769,That's right. A childless concubine makes a harmless pawn.
00:06:22.630,00:06:24.080,这药丸功效显着,00:06:22.089,00:06:24.735,The pill is incredibly effective.
00:06:24.670,00:06:27.000,小主这些日子确实纤瘦了不少,00:06:24.810,00:06:27.480,My Lady has indeed become much slimmer these days.
00:06:28.010,00:06:31.720,只是这药太厉害了 奴婢担心,00:06:28.150,00:06:31.860,"But the medicine is too powerful, and I'm worried that..."
00:06:32.260,00:06:33.340,有什么可担心的,00:06:32.143,00:06:33.866,There's nothing to be worried about.
00:06:34.760,00:06:35.840,明儿就是除夕了,00:06:34.600,00:06:36.480,Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
00:06:37.310,00:06:39.470,我知道它里头的麝香含量有多少,00:06:37.236,00:06:39.396,I know how much musk it contains.
00:06:41.100,00:06:42.640,奴婢泡了一锅羊花汤,00:06:40.983,00:06:44.367,I've drawn a bath with golden azalea petals for Your Highness.
00:06:43.150,00:06:44.230,娘娘快去泡着吧,,,
00:06:44.860,00:06:46.190,反正这些年喝下的,00:06:45.000,00:06:47.866,I've already taken enough tonics of every kind these past years.
00:06:46.610,00:06:47.520,各类汤药也不少,,,
00:06:48.450,00:06:49.530,泡不泡都一样,00:06:48.590,00:06:50.226,The bath won't make any difference.
00:06:50.070,00:06:52.280,小主一直没能怀上皇上的孩子,00:06:50.226,00:06:52.910,"My Lady, you haven't been able to bear a child for His Majesty."
00:06:53.070,00:06:54.530,看来您得想想办法,00:06:52.910,00:06:54.974,You should think of a solution.
00:06:55.490,00:06:56.570,受制于人,00:06:55.373,00:06:57.268,I'm controlled by others.
00:06:57.830,00:07:00.240,连怀孩子都不能自己拿主意,00:06:57.589,00:07:00.490,I can't even be the one to decide on my own pregnancy.
00:07:01.540,00:07:03.030,你知道我有多恨吗,00:07:01.680,00:07:03.585,Do you know how much I hate all of this?
00:07:05.250,00:07:08.090,可是宝鹃我没有办法,00:07:05.514,00:07:08.354,"But Coua, I have no other options."
00:07:09.220,00:07:10.670,我不得不听皇后的,00:07:09.360,00:07:11.074,I have to obey the Empress.
00:08:52.030,00:08:53.730,去年冰嬉才好看,00:08:52.170,00:08:54.380,Last year's ice dancing was even better.
00:08:54.240,00:08:57.230,那出哪吒闹海极得本宫欢心,00:08:54.380,00:08:57.480,"Especially the rendition of
""Nezha Conquers the Dragon's Sea""."
00:08:58.320,00:09:00.280,太祖皇帝就善于走冰,00:08:58.117,00:09:00.643,The founding emperor Nurhaci was a great ice skater.
00:09:01.080,00:09:03.910,他带人出战走冰比马队还快,00:09:00.800,00:09:03.973,"His troops on ice could move even faster
than the cavalries on horses."
00:09:05.250,00:09:07.830,听说皇上当年还是四王爷的时候,00:09:05.090,00:09:08.085,"I heard that when Your Majesty was still Lord IV,"
00:09:08.750,00:09:11.740,年年冰上比骑射都能拿到好彩头,00:09:08.890,00:09:12.200,"you won grand awards in the contest of
horseback archery on the ice every year."
00:10:08.520,00:10:13.230,逆风如解意容易莫摧残,00:10:08.660,00:10:13.760,"""If the north wind can hear the plum flowers,
spare the blooming wishes for a peaceful spring."""
00:10:14.610,00:10:18.150,当日朕与你也是结缘与梅花,00:10:14.750,00:10:18.290,Our story began with plum flowers.
00:10:19.490,00:10:20.400,皇上还记得,00:10:19.630,00:10:21.023,Your Majesty still remembers.
00:10:25.200,00:10:28.700,香中别有韵 清极不知寒,00:10:25.040,00:10:29.560,"""Her pleasant scent accompanied by poetic charm;
she is so freshly elegant that she cannot feel the winter cold."""
00:10:29.420,00:10:32.660,逆风如解意 容易莫摧残,00:10:29.560,00:10:33.600,"""If the north wind can hear the plum flowers,
spare the blooming wishes for a peaceful spring."""
00:10:33.460,00:10:36.200,皇上可还记得姐姐刚入府时,00:10:33.600,00:10:38.877,"Does Your Majesty remember that my sister
liked to recite this poem when you and she were first married?"
00:10:36.710,00:10:38.050,常常吟这首诗啊,,,
00:10:44.260,00:10:46.470,想不到纯元皇后也和臣妾一样,00:10:44.100,00:10:48.677,"I'm honored to know that Empress Première
also appreciated the purity of plum flowers."
00:10:46.810,00:10:48.420,欣赏梅花孤洁之姿,,,
00:10:49.060,00:10:53.270,纯元与你同是性情纯净之人,00:10:49.200,00:10:53.410,You and Première are both of a pure nature.
00:11:40.320,00:11:41.230,安嫔,00:11:40.460,00:11:41.756,Concubine An.
00:13:31.310,00:13:32.170,皇上万福,00:13:31.450,00:13:33.008,Grace to Your Majesty.
00:13:34.390,00:13:35.800,你的嗓子还没好吗,00:13:34.530,00:13:36.280,Has your voice still not recovered?
00:13:36.350,00:13:37.680,臣妾吃伤了东西,,,
00:13:38.400,00:13:39.560,恐怕是不能好了,00:13:36.490,00:13:40.000,"My voice was damaged by something I ate.
I'm afraid it will never fully recover."
00:13:40.690,00:13:42.900,身子还没好就穿得这样单薄,00:13:40.717,00:13:44.288,"You are not wearing enough clothes while still recovering,
and your hands are cold."
00:13:43.230,00:13:44.100,手都冰凉了,,,
00:13:44.940,00:13:47.280,苏培盛取朕的貂裘来,00:13:44.929,00:13:47.457,"Su Peisheng, hand me my marten coat."
00:13:54.040,00:13:56.400,天寒地冻 不要冻坏了身子,00:13:54.180,00:13:56.540,Don't get sick in this freezing weather.
00:13:58.960,00:14:00.540,可惜了你的嗓子,00:13:58.843,00:14:01.230,It's a pity that your voice is damaged.
00:14:01.090,00:14:03.370,失之东隅 收之桑榆,00:14:01.230,00:14:03.510,"""You lose something at sunrise,
you gain something at sunset."""
00:14:04.130,00:14:05.920,安嫔虽然损了嗓子,00:14:04.270,00:14:06.360,"Although Concubine An's voice is damaged,"
00:14:06.220,00:14:07.500,可方才冰上一舞,,,
00:14:07.840,00:14:09.130,真是赛过飞燕哪,00:14:06.360,00:14:10.619,her dance on the ice just now could surpass Feiyan.
00:14:10.890,00:14:13.000,本宫看安嫔称得上为,00:14:11.030,00:14:15.120,"I think Concubine An deserves to be called ""Feiyan on the ice""."
00:14:13.260,00:14:15.000,冰上飞燕四个字,,,
00:14:15.770,00:14:20.310,臣妾想起当年熹贵妃跳的惊鸿舞,00:14:15.567,00:14:22.577,"It reminds me of Lumière's Dance of the Startled Swan.
She also looked like an immortal from Heaven."
00:14:21.310,00:14:22.800,也是恍若天人哪,,,
00:14:24.070,00:14:26.810,当日熹贵妃作惊鸿一舞,00:14:24.210,00:14:29.698,"Noble Consort Lumière's performance was stunning,
and yours was swift and elegant."
00:14:27.530,00:14:30.900,爱妃亦是翩然生姿 各有千秋,00:14:29.698,00:14:31.213,You both have your merits.
00:14:31.450,00:14:32.530,是朕的福气,00:14:31.590,00:14:33.142,I'm blessed to have you both.
00:14:33.700,00:14:36.070,臣妾怎敢与熹贵妃娘娘并肩,00:14:33.840,00:14:36.210,How dare I compare to Her Noble Highness?
00:14:36.620,00:14:38.240,不过是东施效颦罢了,00:14:36.760,00:14:39.062,"I am just ""the ugly Dong Shi imitating the beautiful Xi Shi""."
00:14:38.620,00:14:41.040,朕忘了问了你怎么会到这儿来,00:14:39.062,00:14:41.180,"I have not yet asked, why did you dare perform today?"
00:14:42.290,00:14:43.950,臣妾实在思念皇上,00:14:42.430,00:14:44.714,I yearned for Your Majesty so much.
00:14:44.960,00:14:47.580,想着能远远看一眼皇上,00:14:45.100,00:14:49.178,"I just wanted to be able to look at Your Majesty;
even a glimpse from afar would have satisfied me."
00:14:47.920,00:14:48.910,便心满意足了,,,
00:14:50.090,00:14:51.880,臣妾无福伺候皇上,00:14:50.000,00:14:52.860,I have not Heaven's blessings to be able to serve Your Majesty.
00:14:52.720,00:14:55.460,今日能为皇上一舞已是三生有幸,00:14:52.860,00:14:55.943,"To dance for you today has been ""an honor in three lives""."
00:14:57.020,00:14:58.550,既是不宜出门之人,00:14:56.993,00:14:59.740,"Since it was inappropriate for me to come out,"
00:14:59.600,00:15:02.640,舞已毕还请皇上降罪,00:14:59.740,00:15:01.406,"now that my dance is over,"
,,,00:15:01.406,00:15:04.400,I will accept any punishment that Your Majesty bestows.
00:15:03.440,00:15:04.650,臣妾自甘领受,00:15:04.574,00:15:06.380,"All right, all right."
00:15:04.820,00:15:08.900,好了好了 留在朕身边过年吧,00:15:07.323,00:15:09.474,Stay with me for the New Year.
00:15:10.950,00:15:13.530,熹贵妃已经安然生下皇子,00:15:11.090,00:15:14.050,Consort Lumière has safely given birth to the heirs.
00:15:13.910,00:15:16.700,只是容儿惠嫔生产之前,00:15:14.050,00:15:16.840,"But Lingrong, before Concubine Vertu gives birth,"
00:15:17.500,00:15:19.240,你别去她的碎玉轩,00:15:17.297,00:15:19.806,don’t go to the Palace of Pearl Jade.
00:15:20.500,00:15:21.860,臣妾谨遵圣意,00:15:20.640,00:15:22.616,I'm honored to obey Your Majesty.
00:15:22.250,00:15:25.370,只是臣妾与惠嫔姐姐情同姐妹,00:15:22.616,00:15:25.510,"Since Concubine Vertu and I are close like sisters,"
00:15:25.750,00:15:27.120,却不能亲自去照拂,00:15:25.510,00:15:27.680, I can't help but feel guilty
00:15:27.550,00:15:28.750,实在心中有愧,00:15:27.690,00:15:29.533,that I am unable to take care of her personally.
00:15:35.180,00:15:36.170,狐媚,00:15:35.320,00:15:36.461,What a minx!
00:15:52.030,00:15:56.690,吾皇万岁万岁万万岁,00:15:52.170,00:15:58.080,"May my Emperor live and reign for ten thousand years,
and ten thousand of ten thousand years."
00:15:58.450,00:16:07.370,江南可采莲 莲叶何田田,00:15:58.590,00:16:07.510,"""Lotuses are harvested south of River Yangtze.
How endless their verdant canopy expands!"""
00:16:10.630,00:16:14.290,这些日子皇上一直宠着安嫔,00:16:10.770,00:16:14.430,His Majesty has been favoring Concubine An recently.
00:16:16.050,00:16:19.390,再这样下去封妃也是指日可待,00:16:16.190,00:16:20.000,"If this continues, it is only a matter of time before she becomes a Consort."
00:16:20.140,00:16:21.130,也真难为了她,00:16:20.000,00:16:21.920,She hasn't had it easy.
00:16:22.190,00:16:24.640,容貌呢 不是一等一的出挑,00:16:22.330,00:16:24.780,Her appearance is not the best of the best.
00:16:25.020,00:16:27.560,还是那样的家庭又没有子嗣,00:16:25.160,00:16:27.889,"Let alone her family background
and the fact that she has no children."
00:16:28.480,00:16:30.100,竟也熬到今天这位分,00:16:28.620,00:16:30.844,But she's been able to make it to today's status.
00:16:31.280,00:16:32.770,她不就是一味地装可怜吗,00:16:31.420,00:16:33.460,All she does is act pitiful to gain sympathy.
00:16:33.320,00:16:35.150,偏偏皇上又是这样喜欢得不得了,00:16:33.460,00:16:35.893,I can't believe His Majesty would fall for her tricks.
00:16:37.410,00:16:40.490,不只是皇上换做天下男人,00:16:37.550,00:16:39.044,It is not just His Majesty.
00:16:40.910,00:16:42.320,个个都喜欢得不得了,00:16:39.464,00:16:42.720,Not a man under Heaven could refuse a woman like her.
00:16:43.580,00:16:45.160,小主这镯子一直收着,00:16:43.720,00:16:45.526,"My Lady, you've kept that bracelet in storage."
00:16:45.540,00:16:46.700,怎么今儿取出来了,00:16:45.680,00:16:47.354,Why did you take it out today?
00:16:48.590,00:16:51.420,这东西还是原来皇上赏的,00:16:48.473,00:16:51.303,This was bestowed by His Majesty.
00:16:52.880,00:16:54.920,如今这样的好东西已经少见了,00:16:52.720,00:16:55.403,Such treasures are rare nowadays.
00:16:56.260,00:16:57.920,等一下你亲自拿去延禧宫,00:16:56.400,00:16:59.530,"I want you to take it to the
Palace of Prolonging Happiness and present it to her."
00:16:58.430,00:16:59.130,送给她吧,,,
00:16:59.390,00:17:01.220,如今上贡的翡翠一年不如一年了,00:16:59.530,00:17:01.646,The tributary jadeite is getting worse year by year.
00:17:01.720,00:17:03.310,小主却让奴婢拿去送给她,00:17:01.646,00:17:03.689,And yet you are giving such nice jewelry to her.
00:17:03.980,00:17:05.590,奴婢只可惜了这么好的翡翠,00:17:03.906,00:17:05.818,I can only pity such excellent jade.
00:17:06.310,00:17:07.470,什么可惜不可惜的,00:17:06.450,00:17:08.120,What pity are you speaking of?
00:17:07.980,00:17:08.890,也说给朕听听,00:17:08.120,00:17:09.373,"Tell me, too."
00:17:10.320,00:17:11.430,皇上万福金安,00:17:10.203,00:17:12.006,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:17:12.400,00:17:13.690,外头的奴才好不懂事,00:17:12.283,00:17:13.799,What lax servants outside!
00:17:14.030,00:17:15.310,皇上来了也不通传一声,00:17:14.170,00:17:15.676,They didn’t announce the arrival of Your Majesty.
00:17:15.610,00:17:17.900,朕怕你在午睡就没吵你,00:17:15.676,00:17:18.230,"I was afraid you were napping, so I didn't want to wake you up."
00:17:18.780,00:17:21.490,没想到你们主仆正在说悄悄话儿,00:17:18.920,00:17:21.630,I didn’t realize you were having a private chat.
00:17:21.740,00:17:22.450,快起来吧,00:17:21.880,00:17:23.062,Rise.
00:17:25.460,00:17:27.200,臣妾正在让浣碧找东西呢,00:17:25.343,00:17:27.812,I asked Jade to look for something.
00:17:28.960,00:17:30.200,皇上瞧瞧好不好,00:17:28.671,00:17:30.640,"Please take a look, Your Majesty. What do you think?"
00:17:36.840,00:17:39.250,这仿佛是朕上回赏你的东西,00:17:36.637,00:17:39.647,This seems to be what I rewarded you last time.
00:17:40.100,00:17:41.210,你一向不舍得戴,00:17:40.000,00:17:42.435,You cherish it so much that you can't even bear to wear it.
00:17:42.180,00:17:43.670,好好的寻它出来做什么,00:17:42.435,00:17:43.939,Why did you take it out?
00:17:44.730,00:17:46.180,正因为臣妾不舍得带,00:17:44.613,00:17:46.700,"I don't have the heart to wear it,"
00:17:46.560,00:17:48.050,才要拿出来去送给安妹妹,00:17:46.700,00:17:48.190,but I want to give it to Lingrong.
00:17:49.060,00:17:49.970,连浣碧都说,,,
00:17:50.520,00:17:52.510,这样好的翡翠若不配美人,00:17:49.200,00:17:52.611,"Even Jade said, ""If such good jewelry isn’t worn by a beauty,"""
00:17:52.900,00:17:53.980,放着也可惜了,00:17:52.611,00:17:54.560,"""what a pity it is for the jadeite."""
00:17:55.400,00:17:57.020,皇后也赏了不少东西,00:17:55.540,00:17:57.670,The Empress has also showered her with rewards.
00:17:57.530,00:18:00.070,光内务府封的东西也够丰厚的了,00:17:57.670,00:18:00.210,"The items provided by the
Household Department have been ample."
00:18:00.830,00:18:02.740,安妹妹的东西丰厚是一回事,00:18:00.970,00:18:03.260,It’s nice that she has already received generous rewards.
00:18:03.120,00:18:04.980,臣妾的心意又是另外一回事,00:18:03.260,00:18:05.309,but my sincerity is a different matter.
00:18:06.040,00:18:07.650,只是要拿着皇上赏的东西,00:18:06.180,00:18:09.086,But in order to “present the Buddha with borrowed flowers”.
00:18:08.000,00:18:08.860,去借花献佛了,,,
00:18:09.210,00:18:10.790,还得要问问皇上依不依呢,00:18:09.350,00:18:11.421,I still need to ask for Your Majesty’s permission.
00:18:12.090,00:18:13.950,朕倒瞧着最近你手上,00:18:11.973,00:18:15.462,I see you have been wearing a new coral bracelet.
00:18:14.260,00:18:16.620,多了个珊瑚手钏 倒是挺好看的,00:18:15.462,00:18:16.873,It looks pretty.
00:18:17.840,00:18:21.080,珊瑚原不是什么名贵的东西,00:18:17.980,00:18:21.220,Coral is not a precious material.
00:18:22.510,00:18:24.000,只是安妹妹喜欢翡翠,00:18:22.650,00:18:24.140,"I know that An likes jadeite,"
00:18:24.430,00:18:25.720,臣妾才投其所好,00:18:24.570,00:18:26.539,which is why I want to give her this bracelet.
00:18:26.770,00:18:28.470,皇上倒替安妹妹,,,
00:18:28.770,00:18:30.100,念着臣妾旁的东西了,00:18:26.910,00:18:30.582,But Your Majesty is eyeing my other things for Lingrong.
00:18:31.150,00:18:34.770,容儿出身不高胆子又小,00:18:31.290,00:18:34.910,Lingrong is not from a glorious family and is timid by nature.
00:18:35.480,00:18:38.570,宫里不喜欢她的嫔妃多了去了,00:18:35.406,00:18:38.496,There are a lot of concubines who dislike her.
00:18:39.160,00:18:42.070,唯独你这么多年与她情同姐妹,00:18:39.300,00:18:42.210,Only you have been like a sister to her all these years.
00:18:42.990,00:18:43.950,实在难得,00:18:43.130,00:18:44.675,What a rarity it is.
00:18:47.250,00:18:52.160,嬛嬛有件事朕有些为难,00:18:47.004,00:18:51.914,"Huan Huan, I am in a dilemma about something."
00:18:52.960,00:18:54.580,嬛嬛未必能为四郎解忧,00:18:52.886,00:18:54.890,Huan Huan may not be able to resolve Si Lang's concerns.
00:18:55.050,00:18:56.160,可是很愿意听一听,00:18:54.890,00:18:56.740,But I'm happy to be your audience.
00:18:56.800,00:18:57.710,是你父母,00:18:56.940,00:18:58.039,It's about your parents.
00:18:59.630,00:19:02.300,恐怕不能很快入宫来看你,00:18:59.513,00:19:02.749,"I'm afraid that they may not be able to visit you
 in the palace any time soon."
00:19:02.930,00:19:03.670,为什么,00:19:03.070,00:19:04.282,Why?
00:19:04.390,00:19:07.180,瓜尔佳氏联络群臣反对,00:19:04.530,00:19:07.320,The Gūwalgiya Clan joined forces with many officials to oppose it.
00:19:08.020,00:19:10.380,上谏说朕因宠失正,00:19:08.160,00:19:10.897,They criticized me for being unjust due to personal favor.
00:19:13.440,00:19:14.800,其实皇上未必不知道,00:19:13.571,00:19:15.648,Your Majesty is not unaware
00:19:15.900,00:19:17.360,当年臣妾母家之事,,,
00:19:17.690,00:19:18.850,大有莫须有的嫌疑,00:19:16.040,00:19:20.000,"that the accusations against my family could be
suspected of being a fabrication."
00:19:20.490,00:19:23.070,而且皇上也要为弘瞻的将来考虑,00:19:20.630,00:19:23.550,"Moreover, Your Majesty also needs to consider Hongyan's future."
00:19:24.240,00:19:26.530,总不能让他的外祖父永远是罪臣,00:19:24.380,00:19:27.183,He cannot be the grandson of a guilty official.
00:19:28.750,00:19:31.780,皇上能否考虑重查当年之事,00:19:28.890,00:19:30.160,Can Your Majesty ...
,,,00:19:30.770,00:19:32.800,consider reinvestigating my family's case?
00:19:33.920,00:19:37.330,祺贵人在宫里并无什么大错,00:19:33.606,00:19:37.917,Noble Lady Délice has not committed any grave mistakes in the palace.
00:19:38.710,00:19:42.130,瓜尔佳氏一族也暂时无隙可查,00:19:38.850,00:19:43.096,"Also, The Gūwalgiya Clan hasn't given us
 an angle to reopen the investigation."
00:19:44.600,00:19:47.460,若贸然翻查过去之事,,,
00:19:48.270,00:19:51.050,只会让朝廷动摇不安,00:19:44.203,00:19:51.971,"Reinvestigating past cases without any reason
will only threaten the stability of the imperial court."
00:19:53.310,00:19:55.720,臣妾可以等,00:19:53.450,00:19:55.671,"Your Majesty, I can wait."

00:20:06.410,00:20:07.020,贵妃嫂嫂,00:20:06.473,00:20:07.992,Your Noble Highness.
00:20:08.580,00:20:10.990,天气还凉贝勒怎么穿得那么单薄,00:20:08.720,00:20:11.130,It's still chilly. Why does Venerable Prince Shen wear so little?
00:20:11.540,00:20:12.700,该加些衣裳才是,00:20:11.337,00:20:13.280,You should put on some warm layers.
00:20:13.710,00:20:14.950,多谢贵妃嫂嫂关照,00:20:13.850,00:20:15.600,I thank Your Noble Highness for your concern.
00:20:15.460,00:20:17.700,刚才在寿康宫给太后请安的时候,00:20:15.600,00:20:19.183,"Her Majesty also reminded me when I was
paying my respects at the Palace of Longevity."
00:20:18.130,00:20:19.160,太后也提醒了我,,,
00:20:19.590,00:20:21.450,只是我觉得太过饱暖,00:20:19.516,00:20:23.346,I think being well-fed and well-clad weakens one's character.
00:20:21.840,00:20:23.000,会让人意志软弱,,,
00:20:23.470,00:20:25.800,故而选择了单薄些的衣服来穿,00:20:23.610,00:20:25.940,Thus I have chosen to wear thin clothes.
00:20:26.100,00:20:27.260,长姐叫我好找,00:20:25.940,00:20:27.583,"Elder sister, I've been looking for you."
00:20:27.560,00:20:29.170,再不回去弘瞻可要哭了呢,00:20:27.583,00:20:29.806,"If you don't go back now, Hongyan will start crying."
00:20:29.970,00:20:31.810,这位小主未曾见过 不知是,00:20:30.000,00:20:32.172,"I don't think we've met, My Lady. I wonder..."
00:20:32.020,00:20:33.760,难不成略平头整脸些的,00:20:32.172,00:20:35.705,Must every decent-looking girl be married to His Majesty?
00:20:34.150,00:20:36.430,都要嫁给皇上吗 我偏不是,00:20:35.705,00:20:37.471,I'm not a concubine.
00:20:37.610,00:20:38.440,什么嫁不嫁,00:20:37.471,00:20:39.151,Why are you mentioning the word marriage?
00:20:39.150,00:20:40.730,女孩子嘴里竟没半句遮掩,00:20:39.376,00:20:41.774,A girl should know what she can speak of.
00:20:42.240,00:20:43.100,贝勒不必见外,,,
00:20:44.030,00:20:45.140,这是我娘家小妹,00:20:42.166,00:20:45.153,"Venerable Prince Shen, please don't feel like an outsider.
This is my younger sister."
00:20:45.610,00:20:47.020,小妹不轻易出来走动,00:20:45.366,00:20:46.776,She has rarely come out.
00:20:47.370,00:20:48.530,难怪贝勒觉得眼生,00:20:47.210,00:20:49.295,It is no wonder Your Lordship does not recognize her.
00:20:50.620,00:20:52.830,小妹从小长在边远之地,00:20:50.760,00:20:52.970,My sister grew up in a remote area.
00:20:53.210,00:20:54.070,实在不懂规矩,00:20:52.970,00:20:54.948,She's uneducated about palace etiquette.
00:20:54.960,00:20:56.290,还请贝勒不要见笑,00:20:55.100,00:20:57.091,I hope she did not incur Your Lordship's ridicule.
00:20:57.330,00:20:58.370,还不见过慎贝勒,00:20:57.470,00:20:59.110,"Now, greet Venerable Prince Shen!"
00:21:03.260,00:21:04.750,难怪王爷错认了我,00:21:03.400,00:21:06.017,"It's no surprise that Your Lordship
mistook me for a concubine."
00:21:05.220,00:21:07.210,想来这宫中略有姿色的,,,
00:21:07.510,00:21:09.300,都是受皇上雨露恩惠的人,00:21:06.217,00:21:09.577,"In this palace, everyone with a pretty face
receives His Majesty's favor."
00:21:10.010,00:21:11.600,以致王爷如此猜想,00:21:10.000,00:21:12.226,That was probably the reason for Your Lordship's speculation.
00:21:12.930,00:21:14.720,玉娆越来越放肆了,00:21:13.070,00:21:14.860,"Yurao, that's enough!"
00:21:15.900,00:21:17.100,姑娘如此心高气傲,00:21:16.040,00:21:17.440,"Miss, you are very proud and haughty."
00:21:17.730,00:21:19.560,连皇兄富贵也视作无物,00:21:17.597,00:21:20.857,"You seem to view His Majesty's power and wealth as nothing.
Perhaps ..."
00:21:19.940,00:21:22.060,看来唯有十七哥的盛名,00:21:20.857,00:21:23.943,"only the prestige of my brother, Lord XVII,
could catch your eye."
00:21:22.650,00:21:23.890,才能入姑娘的眼了,,,
00:21:24.280,00:21:26.490,怎么唯有皇室公卿的男子,00:21:24.120,00:21:27.840,"Why?
Do worthy men exist only in the imperial family?"
00:21:26.780,00:21:27.520,才是好的吗,,,
00:21:28.120,00:21:30.200,我宁愿嫁与匹夫草草一生,00:21:28.104,00:21:32.286,"I'd rather live a coarse life with a commoner
than marry into any imperial palace or estate."
00:21:30.530,00:21:32.200,也断不入宫门王府半步,,,
00:21:33.040,00:21:34.700,失礼 是我小看了姑娘,00:21:32.988,00:21:35.220,It was my discourtesy. I underestimated you.
00:21:36.750,00:21:38.240,小妹素来口无遮斓,,,
00:21:38.500,00:21:39.460,并非存心刁蛮,00:21:36.930,00:21:41.060,"My sister always talks bluntly but she didn't mean any offense.
I hope Your Lordship won't mind her."
00:21:39.920,00:21:41.130,还请王爷莫要见怪,,,
00:21:41.630,00:21:43.090,走吧姐姐走,00:21:41.770,00:21:43.230,"Let's go, sister."
00:21:49.680,00:21:50.540,你今儿是怎么了,00:21:49.820,00:21:50.982,What's with you today?
00:21:51.010,00:21:51.800,怎么心里有什么事,,,
00:21:52.140,00:21:52.920,老兜着笑不出来似的,00:21:51.150,00:21:53.528,"What's on your mind?
You can't suppress your smile."
00:21:53.560,00:21:54.300,我哪里想笑了,00:21:53.700,00:21:54.997,I'm not smiling.
00:21:55.180,00:21:57.930,你有什么事还想骗我别藏了,00:21:54.997,00:21:58.580,Don't lie to me. You can't hide anything.
00:21:58.440,00:21:59.300,跟你十七哥说说,00:21:58.580,00:22:00.000,"Come on, tell your 17th brother."
00:21:59.860,00:22:01.940,看到一个姑娘脾气大得很,00:22:00.000,00:22:02.163,I met a girl with such a strong personality.
00:22:02.570,00:22:04.560,而且呀很瞧不上咱们,00:22:02.496,00:22:04.599,"Also, she thinks we are not good enough for her."
00:22:06.070,00:22:06.980,咱们有什么好啊,00:22:06.210,00:22:07.710,True. What's good about us?
00:22:07.570,00:22:08.900,不过就是出身皇家,00:22:07.710,00:22:09.380,All we have is birth into the imperial family.
00:22:09.570,00:22:11.110,保不齐还兄弟相残,00:22:09.710,00:22:11.750,"But, people have been stripped of their noble titles,"
00:22:11.780,00:22:13.270,被削了爵位的大有人在,00:22:11.920,00:22:13.712,and brothers have died fighting each other for the throne.
00:22:14.160,00:22:15.070,没有什么可羡慕的,00:22:14.300,00:22:15.656,That is nothing to be envious of.
00:22:15.700,00:22:17.410,十七哥别说这些丧气话,00:22:15.840,00:22:17.550,"Brother XVII, enough of these depressing words."
00:22:17.790,00:22:19.280,走咱们赛马去,00:22:17.930,00:22:19.420,Let's race!
00:22:19.750,00:22:20.360,走,00:22:19.890,00:22:22.086,Let's go!
00:22:37.520,00:22:39.470,娘娘温太医来请平安脉了,00:22:37.660,00:22:39.610,"Your Highness, Dr. Wen is here for routine pulse-taking."
00:22:39.900,00:22:40.760,快请进来吧,00:22:40.040,00:22:41.414,Send him in.
00:22:50.030,00:22:51.690,微臣给娘娘请安,00:22:50.170,00:22:51.830,Peace to Your Highness.
00:22:52.580,00:22:53.310,不必多礼,00:22:52.720,00:22:54.109,Don't be bound by formalities.
00:22:59.790,00:23:01.080,眉姐姐胎气如何,00:22:59.930,00:23:01.446,How is Meizhuang's prenatal qi?
00:23:01.880,00:23:03.990,惠嫔不出半月就要临盆了,00:23:02.020,00:23:04.394,Concubine Vertu is going to deliver in less than half a month.
00:23:04.460,00:23:07.040,数月来她静心养胎胎气甚稳,00:23:04.600,00:23:09.160,"She's been cultivating a peaceful mind for the baby
these months and her prenatal qi is very stable."
00:23:09.090,00:23:11.380,虽然每每都听你说一样的话,00:23:09.230,00:23:11.520,"Although every time you tell me the same thing,"
00:23:11.930,00:23:12.790,但每听一次,,,
00:23:13.260,00:23:14.720,l已里的安稳便多了一分,00:23:12.070,00:23:15.159,your words bring peace to my mind each time.
00:23:16.470,00:23:19.060,这些年多少故人都去了,00:23:16.610,00:23:19.313,"So many old acquaintances are gone over the years,"
00:23:20.020,00:23:21.630,幸好还有你们在身边,00:23:20.160,00:23:22.260,"but fortunately, I still have you and Meizhuang."
00:23:22.610,00:23:26.060,是啊幸好要紧的故人都还在,00:23:22.750,00:23:26.200,Yes. Luckily the most important people are still here.
00:23:36.410,00:23:38.780,对了甄伯父的病已经见好转了,00:23:36.550,00:23:38.920,"And Mr. Zhen is much better now, Your Highness."
00:23:39.830,00:23:42.450,微臣得空去看看他您放心吧,00:23:39.970,00:23:42.590,"Please don't worry, I'll visit him whenever I can."
00:23:44.170,00:23:45.660,本宫出入宫禁不方便,00:23:44.310,00:23:46.253,It's not convenient for me to leave the palace.
00:23:46.500,00:23:48.590,父亲那边还得劳烦你,00:23:46.640,00:23:48.843,So I have to trouble you to take care of my father.
00:23:49.630,00:23:51.370,惠嫔平安生产之后,00:23:49.770,00:23:52.132,I'll go visit Mr. Zhen often
00:23:52.180,00:23:54.130,微臣会多去看看甄伯父的,00:23:52.320,00:23:55.087,after Concubine Vertu gives birth to the baby safely.
00:23:57.060,00:23:57.720,长姐,00:23:56.857,00:23:58.117,Sister.
00:24:04.810,00:24:07.050,二小姐跑得好快啊当心摔着,00:24:04.607,00:24:07.413,"My Second Lady, you ran so fast!
Be more careful!"
00:24:07.650,00:24:09.640,里面槿汐会照顾你先出去吧,00:24:07.790,00:24:09.780,"Jinxi will take care of us, you may leave now."
00:24:10.150,00:24:10.770,是,00:24:10.290,00:24:11.200,Yes.
00:24:11.150,00:24:12.810,小允子在陪弘瞻玩纸鹤,00:24:11.290,00:24:13.139,Xiao-Yunzi is playing paper cranes with Hongyan.
00:24:13.160,00:24:14.740,姐姐要不要去看 可好玩了,00:24:13.300,00:24:14.955,Do you want to join them? It's fun.
00:24:15.030,00:24:15.820,你自己去看吧,00:24:15.170,00:24:16.262,You can go by yourself.
00:24:20.160,00:24:21.530,给贵妃娘娘请安,00:24:20.300,00:24:21.783,Peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:24:22.790,00:24:23.500,苏公公,00:24:22.930,00:24:23.640,Mr. Su.
00:24:23.960,00:24:26.950,娘娘皇上说午后请娘娘,00:24:24.100,00:24:30.000,"His Majesty asked Your Highness to visit the Sixth Prince
in the Imperial Nursery with him after lunch."
00:24:27.340,00:24:29.500,一同前往阿哥所探视六阿哥,,,
00:24:30.010,00:24:33.210,知道了还劳烦苏公公跑一趟,00:24:30.150,00:24:33.388,"All right. Thank you for coming over and telling me, Mr. Su."
00:24:33.720,00:24:37.590,娘娘客气了 碧姑娘不在,00:24:33.860,00:24:35.832,That's so kind of Your Highness.
,,,00:24:36.737,00:24:38.484,Is Jade not here today?
00:24:38.220,00:24:41.090,幸好 否则她听了可要心疼了,00:24:38.635,00:24:41.230,"That's fortunate. Otherwise, she'll be sad after hearing this."
00:24:41.930,00:24:43.050,娘娘您是知道的,00:24:42.070,00:24:43.360,"As Your Highness knows,"
00:24:43.440,00:24:46.050,十七爷自入春以来身体就不大好,00:24:43.580,00:24:47.586,"Lord XVII has not been in good health since this spring
and has had several fevers."
00:24:46.440,00:24:48.900,时常发烧经太医诊断说是,,,
00:24:49.320,00:24:50.520,寒气侵体啊,00:24:47.775,00:24:51.069,The doctor said he has been invaded by cold qi.
00:24:51.070,00:24:53.680,谁知道昨儿午后跟慎贝勒去驰马,00:24:51.210,00:24:53.858,Yesterday afternoon he rode horses with Venerable Prince Shen.
00:24:53.900,00:24:56.150,那马发了性把王爷给摔了下来,00:24:54.040,00:24:56.403,The horse lost its temper and His Lordship fell off.
00:24:56.910,00:24:58.020,摔得倒是不重,00:24:57.050,00:24:58.462,"His injuries aren't bad,"
00:24:58.580,00:25:01.490,只是半夜里身子又滚烫了起来,00:24:58.720,00:25:01.743,but at night his fever was burning up again.
00:25:03.120,00:25:05.410,奴才得赶紧去回禀太后一声,00:25:03.260,00:25:07.193,"I have to report this to Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
and make her aware of the situation."
00:25:05.750,00:25:06.910,也好叫太后安心哪,,,
00:25:07.250,00:25:07.910,这么大的事情,00:25:07.390,00:25:08.427,Such a grave matter...
00:25:08.460,00:25:10.080,怎么没人来告诉本宫一声呢,00:25:08.600,00:25:10.371,Why didn't anyone tell me?
00:25:10.800,00:25:13.130,娘娘忙于理会六宫之事,00:25:10.940,00:25:13.421,Your Highness is busy with the palace affairs.
00:25:13.590,00:25:15.880,这种事怎么好来惊扰娘娘呢,00:25:13.730,00:25:16.209,How can we bother Your Highness with such matters?
00:25:16.510,00:25:18.470,何况王府之事,,,
00:25:19.010,00:25:20.590,自有皇后娘娘打理呢,00:25:16.650,00:25:21.767,"In addition, Her Majesty the Empress
always manages the affairs of the extended family."
00:25:24.230,00:25:26.640,是本宫是想着,00:25:24.370,00:25:26.780,Yes. I was just thinking about ...
00:25:27.230,00:25:28.590,皇后娘娘身子才好,00:25:27.370,00:25:28.730,Her Majesty's health.
00:25:28.940,00:25:29.850,还要照顾太后那边,00:25:29.080,00:25:30.910,She also has to look after the Empress Dowager.
00:25:30.770,00:25:32.060,所以才多嘴问了一句,00:25:30.910,00:25:32.351,So I inqured about it.
00:25:32.530,00:25:34.230,娘娘德惠六宫,00:25:32.670,00:25:34.750,Your Highness shows kindness to the entire harem.
00:25:34.610,00:25:36.270,自然也关心王府的事,00:25:34.750,00:25:36.712,It's only natural for you to care for the lords.
00:25:37.070,00:25:38.980,就算娘娘自个儿不上心,00:25:37.210,00:25:39.120,"Even if it doesn't concern Your Highness,"
00:25:39.240,00:25:41.530,也得为了碧姑娘过问一二嘛,00:25:39.380,00:25:41.783,you'd still ask about it for Jade's sake.
00:25:43.450,00:25:44.280,你赶紧去吧,00:25:43.590,00:25:45.000,Go report to the Empress Dowager now.
00:25:45.370,00:25:46.080,奴才告退,00:25:45.510,00:25:46.861,"I take my leave, Your Highness."
00:25:53.460,00:25:55.500,玉娆 我身子乏了,00:25:53.600,00:25:55.640,"Yurao, I'm feeling tired."
00:25:56.510,00:25:57.960,你去和弘瞻 灵犀玩吧,00:25:56.650,00:25:58.515,How about you go play with Hongyan and Lingxi?
00:26:04.980,00:26:06.970,劳烦你一次可以吗,00:26:05.120,00:26:07.200,Can I bother you ... with this?
00:26:09.100,00:26:12.220,不是你去瞧过我总是不安心,00:26:09.240,00:26:12.360,I can't rest assured if anyone else goes and visits.
00:26:14.280,00:26:15.390,你还是放不下吗,00:26:14.420,00:26:15.906,You still cannot move on from him?
00:26:18.950,00:26:21.230,他当年寒气侵体也是为了我,00:26:19.090,00:26:21.747,It's because of me that he became so susceptible to the cold.
00:26:22.240,00:26:23.200,我欠他太多了,00:26:22.380,00:26:23.566,I owe him too much.
00:26:25.000,00:26:27.740,只当请你帮我还一点吧,00:26:25.140,00:26:27.880,Can I ask you to help me repay my indebtedness?
00:26:42.680,00:26:43.890,你担心他的身子,00:26:42.820,00:26:44.370,You're worried about his health?
00:26:47.600,00:26:48.510,去瞧瞧他吧,00:26:47.740,00:26:48.914,You should go visit him.
00:26:49.940,00:26:52.270,我做不到的事情你去也好,00:26:50.080,00:26:52.410,Do what I cannot do - for me.
00:26:53.360,00:26:54.720,总会多一个人安心,00:26:53.500,00:26:55.501,"At least, it would bring peace to one more person."
,,,00:26:56.120,00:26:57.408,Really?
00:26:55.980,00:27:02.200,真的只是奴婢应该怎么出去,00:26:58.804,00:27:02.340,But how do I... get out of the Palace?
00:27:04.370,00:27:05.900,你去告诉苏培盛一声,00:27:04.510,00:27:06.040,Go talk to Su Peisheng.
00:27:06.790,00:27:09.650,他会成全你的去吧,00:27:06.930,00:27:08.939,He'll grant you this wish.
,,,00:27:09.241,00:27:10.092,Go.
00:27:19.260,00:27:20.370,小主有什么话,00:27:19.400,00:27:21.150,"My Lady, are there any messages"
00:27:21.010,00:27:22.420,需要奴婢带给王爷的吗,00:27:21.150,00:27:23.088,that you need me to deliver for you?
00:27:27.350,00:27:30.590,我没有别的话你去吧,00:27:27.490,00:27:29.212,I have no messages.
,,,00:27:30.000,00:27:31.329,You can go now.
00:28:28.040,00:28:28.690,嬛儿,00:28:28.180,00:28:29.207,Huan'er...
00:28:29.750,00:28:30.400,王爷,00:28:29.890,00:28:30.842,Your Lordship.
00:28:35.710,00:28:38.290,阿晋 王爷醒了 快点拿茶来,00:28:35.850,00:28:38.430,Ajin. His Lordship is awake. Bring some tea.
00:28:40.510,00:28:41.790,王爷您醒了,00:28:40.650,00:28:41.930,"You're awake, Your Lordship."
00:28:46.510,00:28:47.130,王爷,00:28:46.650,00:28:47.534,Your Lordship.
00:28:48.890,00:28:49.920,是嬛儿让你来的吗,00:28:49.030,00:28:50.429,Did Huan'er send you here?
,,,00:28:51.280,00:28:51.880,No...
00:28:51.140,00:28:54.470,不 是我求着苏公公让我来的,00:28:53.000,00:28:55.939,I begged Mr. Su to let me come.
00:29:00.070,00:29:01.930,多谢这些日子你对我的照顾,00:29:00.210,00:29:02.240,Thank you for taking care of me these days.
00:29:04.070,00:29:06.730,宫里还有事你去帮嬛儿吧,00:29:04.210,00:29:06.870,You should go back and help Huan'er in the palace.
00:29:07.530,00:29:08.570,她一个人也不方便,00:29:07.670,00:29:09.380,It inconveniences her to be left alone.
00:29:09.240,00:29:11.780,不急宫里还有槿汐嘛,00:29:09.380,00:29:11.920,There's no hurry. Jinxi is in the palace with her.
00:29:13.660,00:29:14.740,王爷身子不适,00:29:13.800,00:29:15.182,Your Lordship is unwell.
00:29:15.420,00:29:17.030,要是我没有把王爷照顾好,00:29:15.560,00:29:17.359,"If I don't take good care of Your Lordship,"
00:29:17.380,00:29:18.330,谁都不会安心的,00:29:17.520,00:29:18.772,nobody will be at peace.
00:29:18.790,00:29:20.030,那我就白出宫一趟了,00:29:18.930,00:29:20.585,And my effort to come here would be wasted.
00:29:23.050,00:29:23.830,随你吧,00:29:23.190,00:29:24.159,If you wish.
00:29:34.180,00:29:37.300,皇上这些天怎么没往后宫里来啊,00:29:34.320,00:29:37.515,How come His Majesty hasn't been visiting the harem recently?
00:29:38.860,00:29:42.190,前朝事情太多 加上要设军机处,00:29:39.000,00:29:42.330,"There's a lot going on in the court.
And the Grand Council is being set up."
00:29:42.780,00:29:43.730,皇上忙不过来,00:29:42.920,00:29:44.247,His Majesty is too busy.
00:29:45.610,00:29:46.400,难怪呢,00:29:45.750,00:29:46.540,No wonder.
00:29:48.200,00:29:50.310,皇后这几天倒看着有些精神了,00:29:48.340,00:29:50.720,The Empress seems to have more energy these days.
00:29:52.540,00:29:53.650,我听说祺贵人,00:29:52.680,00:29:54.140,I heard Noble Lady Délice
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.700,从外头请了个姑子进来讲经,00:29:54.140,00:29:56.160,invited a nun from outside to give a sermon.
00:29:56.790,00:29:59.450,怎么宝华殿的法师不好吗,00:29:56.930,00:29:59.590,Do the priests in the Baohua Hall not satisfy her?
00:29:59.880,00:30:00.620,奴婢听说,00:30:00.020,00:30:01.120,I heard that
00:30:01.210,00:30:03.080,祺贵人总说自己身上不舒服,00:30:01.350,00:30:03.522,"Lady Délice repeatedly claimed to be feeling unwell,"
00:30:03.550,00:30:05.750,又说总见着那几个宝华殿的师父,00:30:03.690,00:30:06.360,and said it annoyed her to always see the same priests
00:30:06.220,00:30:07.210,看着就心烦,00:30:06.360,00:30:07.690,in the Baohua Hall.
00:30:08.720,00:30:10.460,左不过是请了国寺里的师父,00:30:08.860,00:30:11.692,"At the worst, she can bring in a nun from the state temple."
00:30:10.760,00:30:11.550,来讲经吧,,,
00:30:13.310,00:30:15.670,这些奴婢本该好好留意的,00:30:13.450,00:30:15.810,I should have paid more attention to it.
00:30:16.060,00:30:17.390,奴婢觉得这毽子这样就好了,00:30:16.200,00:30:17.530,I think this jianzi is already perfect.
00:30:17.690,00:30:18.600,只是今儿一大早,00:30:17.830,00:30:19.080,But Her Majesty ordered me
00:30:18.940,00:30:19.720,皇后就把奴婢,00:30:19.080,00:30:20.080,early in the morning
00:30:19.940,00:30:22.810,派去给那些新来的宫女教规矩,00:30:20.080,00:30:22.950,to teach the new maids the rules in the palace.
00:30:23.190,00:30:25.430,谁知忙了一天呢实在没顾上,00:30:23.330,00:30:25.721,I didn't have time to attend to it all day.
00:30:25.740,00:30:26.440,罢了,00:30:25.880,00:30:26.790,It's fine.
00:30:26.650,00:30:28.990,对了苏培盛今儿来说,00:30:26.790,00:30:29.507,"Oh, Su Peisheng told me today that"
00:30:30.280,00:30:31.690,王爷的体热退了,00:30:30.420,00:30:32.132,His Lordship's fever is gone.
00:30:32.830,00:30:34.490,但还需要静养几天,00:30:32.970,00:30:34.894,But he still needs to rest in bed for a few days.
00:30:35.540,00:30:37.400,又说浣碧姑娘,00:30:35.680,00:30:37.540,And he also said Jade
00:30:37.750,00:30:39.660,大概还要再留侍几天才行,00:30:37.890,00:30:40.000,may need to stay a few more days.
00:30:41.840,00:30:45.450,有时我还真有些羡慕浣碧,00:30:41.980,00:30:45.628,"Sometimes, I'm really envious of Jade."
00:30:46.470,00:30:48.300,姐姐是羡慕浣碧能出宫吗,00:30:46.610,00:30:48.893,"Sister, are you jealous of her freedom to go out of the Palace?"
00:30:48.970,00:30:50.300,我瞧着永寿宫虽大,00:30:49.110,00:30:50.780,"The Palace of Eternal Longevity is grand,"
00:30:50.840,00:30:53.050,但是望出去的天四四方方的,00:30:50.980,00:30:53.190,but you can only see the sky in a small square.
00:30:53.600,00:30:54.930,总不及宫外自由,00:30:53.740,00:30:55.523,It's not as free as being outside of the palace.
00:30:56.020,00:30:58.220,是啊我羡慕浣碧,00:30:56.160,00:30:59.680,"Yes, I'm jealous that she gets to go outside at times."
00:30:58.520,00:30:59.470,时常能出去逛逛,,,
00:31:00.480,00:31:01.810,姐姐别以为我贪玩儿,00:31:00.620,00:31:02.200,"You know I prefer being out,"
00:31:02.060,00:31:03.980,我是心甘情愿留在这儿陪你的,00:31:02.200,00:31:04.535,but right now I genuinely want to stay here to accompany you.
00:31:06.690,00:31:09.150,这凤仙花是花房培育出来的新种,00:31:06.830,00:31:09.290,This is a new breed of balsam.
00:31:09.610,00:31:12.650,叫醉胭脂染在指甲上可好看了,00:31:09.750,00:31:13.280,"It's called “the drunken rouge.""
It's very pretty to color your nails with it."
00:31:13.740,00:31:15.860,也难得他们春日里就育出来,00:31:13.880,00:31:16.000,It's rare to be grown in early spring.
00:31:16.290,00:31:17.530,姐姐用着多好啊,00:31:16.430,00:31:17.821,It looks so nice on your nails.
00:31:22.000,00:31:23.460,给贵妃娘娘请安,00:31:22.140,00:31:23.864,Peace to Your Noble Highness.
00:31:24.420,00:31:25.080,起来吧,00:31:24.560,00:31:25.371,Rise.
00:31:27.170,00:31:28.960,皇后娘娘请您即刻,,,
00:31:29.300,00:31:30.380,前往景仁宫一趟,00:31:27.310,00:31:31.062,"Her Majesty the Empress requests your presence
immediately at the Palace of Great Benevolence."
00:31:31.090,00:31:31.750,什么事啊,00:31:31.230,00:31:32.116,What's the matter?
00:31:32.140,00:31:35.170,事关紧要娘娘问皇后就是,00:31:32.280,00:31:35.310,It's a serious matter. Please ask Her Majesty.
00:31:35.600,00:31:36.800,奴才不便回答,00:31:35.740,00:31:37.166,I'm not at liberty to say anything.
00:31:38.980,00:31:39.560,备轿,00:31:39.120,00:31:39.700,Prepare the sedan chair.
00:31:49.320,00:31:52.860,王爷的病才好 小心又惹了风寒,00:31:49.460,00:31:53.000,"Your Lordship has just recovered.
Be careful not to catch a cold again."
00:31:54.910,00:31:55.570,多谢,00:31:55.050,00:31:55.936,Thank you.
00:31:56.740,00:31:59.230,王爷要是谢我 那就是见外了,00:31:56.880,00:32:00.275,"Your Lordship must see yourself as an outsider
if you stand on such courtesies with me."
00:32:01.580,00:32:02.790,你看那天上的风筝,00:32:01.720,00:32:03.307,Look at the kite in the sky.
00:32:03.960,00:32:04.990,看着飞得那么高,00:32:04.100,00:32:05.440,"It's flying so high,"
00:32:05.750,00:32:07.240,其实只有游丝一线牵着,00:32:05.890,00:32:07.833,but it's only tied to a thin thread.
00:32:08.590,00:32:09.450,多不牢靠啊,00:32:08.730,00:32:09.779,How unstable.
00:32:11.430,00:32:12.840,原来王爷喜欢看风筝,00:32:11.570,00:32:13.395,Does Your Lordship like to watch kites fly?
00:32:14.430,00:32:17.470,不我是觉得环儿现在的处境,00:32:14.570,00:32:17.874,"No, I'm just thinking of Huan'er."
00:32:18.270,00:32:19.130,就像那风筝,00:32:18.410,00:32:20.000,In her current situation she is just like a kite.
00:32:21.060,00:32:23.430,浣碧 我已经好了,00:32:21.200,00:32:21.880,"Jade,"
,,,00:32:22.970,00:32:24.091,I'm fully recovered.
00:32:24.400,00:32:25.350,你回宫帮嬛儿吧,00:32:24.391,00:32:26.280,You can go back and help Huan'er.
00:32:28.020,00:32:29.010,王爷不必担心,00:32:28.160,00:32:29.490,"Please don't worry, Your Lordship."
00:32:30.400,00:32:33.020,娘娘有皇上有皇上的孩子,00:32:30.540,00:32:33.349,Her Highness has His Majesty and his children.
00:32:33.990,00:32:34.770,她什么都不怕,00:32:34.130,00:32:35.040,She fears nothing.
00:32:36.580,00:32:38.360,祺贵人你一定要向本宫,00:32:36.906,00:32:39.705,"Noble Lady Délice, you insisted on reporting
against Noble Consort Lumiere."
00:32:38.700,00:32:39.530,告发熹贵妃,,,
00:32:40.040,00:32:41.740,还要本宫请来后宫众人,00:32:40.180,00:32:42.240,And you asked me to invite the entire harem.
00:32:42.210,00:32:43.410,到底所为何事啊,00:32:42.350,00:32:43.550,What is it about?
00:32:46.380,00:32:48.120,臣妾要告发熹贵妃私通,00:32:46.520,00:32:48.560,I'm reporting on Noble Consort Lumiere's adultery.
00:32:48.420,00:32:49.580,秽乱后宫罪不容诛,00:32:48.560,00:32:50.399,Death would be a merciful punishment for desecrating the harem!
00:32:54.260,00:32:57.130,宫规森严 祺贵人不得信口雌黄,00:32:54.400,00:32:57.270,"Defamation is a serious offense in the palace.
Lady Délice, how dare you make baseless accusations!"
00:32:57.680,00:32:58.960,臣妾若有半句虚言,00:32:57.820,00:32:59.364,"If half a word I say today proves to be false,"
00:32:59.220,00:33:00.840,便叫五雷轰顶 永不超生,00:32:59.364,00:33:01.471,"let me get struck by the Five Thunders,
never to be reborn."
00:33:02.270,00:33:03.680,我还以为是什么毒誓呢,00:33:02.410,00:33:03.820,What kind of oath is that?
00:33:04.600,00:33:06.310,生死之事谁又能知啊,00:33:04.740,00:33:06.714,Nobody knows the timing of their life and death.
00:33:07.400,00:33:09.310,以此虚妄之事赌誓,00:33:07.540,00:33:09.440,Swearing on something so intangible
00:33:10.530,00:33:12.940,可见祺贵人不是真心的了,00:33:10.670,00:33:13.080,only shows how insincere you are.
00:33:15.780,00:33:17.570,臣妾以瓜尔佳氏一族起誓,00:33:15.920,00:33:17.710,"I swear on the whole Guwalgiya clan,"
00:33:17.950,00:33:20.280,若有半句虚言 全族无后而终,00:33:18.090,00:33:20.571,"if I make any false accusation,
my clan will end with no heirs."
00:33:22.500,00:33:23.950,你既说熹贵妃私通,00:33:22.640,00:33:24.542,"You accuse Noble Consort Lumiere of adultery,"
00:33:24.580,00:33:25.660,那奸夫是谁啊,00:33:24.720,00:33:26.215,then who's her adulterer?
00:33:29.340,00:33:30.700,太医温实初,00:33:29.480,00:33:31.142,Imperial Doctor Wen Shichu.
00:33:34.760,00:33:36.590,温实初是熹贵妃的心腹,00:33:34.900,00:33:36.919,Wen Shichu is Noble Consort Lumiere's most trusted doctor.
00:33:37.050,00:33:38.170,日日都要把脉的,00:33:37.190,00:33:38.560,He takes her pulse every day.
00:33:38.930,00:33:41.170,若说日久生情也是难怪,00:33:39.070,00:33:41.310,It's no surprise if they gradually developed affection towards each other.
00:33:41.850,00:33:43.880,更何况我听说熹贵妃,,,
00:33:44.180,00:33:46.140,初入宫时卧病许久,00:33:41.990,00:33:46.357,"Besides, I heard Noble Consort Lumiere was unwell
for a long time when she first entered the palace."
00:33:46.690,00:33:48.850,当时就是温太医诊断的,00:33:46.830,00:33:49.141,"Back then, it was Dr. Wen who took charge of her treatment."
00:33:49.270,00:33:50.510,康常在好记性,00:33:49.410,00:33:51.080,Attendant Kang does have a good memory.
00:33:50.940,00:33:53.310,原来孽情深种始于当日,00:33:51.080,00:33:53.450,That must have been when this sinful relationship started.
00:33:54.110,00:33:56.320,两位妹妹怎么能如此揣测,00:33:54.250,00:33:56.460,How could you two make such speculations?
00:33:56.570,00:33:59.190,熹贵妃入宫病重由温太医诊治,00:33:56.710,00:33:59.330,It's only natural that Noble Consort Lumiere
00:33:59.620,00:34:01.070,乃是情理之中的事,00:33:59.760,00:34:01.361,was treated by Dr. Wen.
00:34:01.950,00:34:03.740,温太医医术高明不说,00:34:02.090,00:34:04.106,"Not only is Dr. Wen highly skilled in medicine,"
00:34:04.200,00:34:06.490,与姐姐母家素日也有交情,00:34:04.340,00:34:06.819,but he also had a good relationship with Lumière's maiden family.
00:34:07.120,00:34:10.330,入宫之后互相照应也是应当的,00:34:07.260,00:34:10.696,"Naturally, they are supposed to look after each other in the palace."
00:34:11.250,00:34:13.210,怎么会有私通一说,00:34:11.390,00:34:13.730,How could you accuse them of adultery for that?
00:34:13.590,00:34:16.200,如此说来竟是青梅竹马了,00:34:13.730,00:34:16.340,"If that's the case, they're bosom friends since childhood."
00:34:17.630,00:34:19.220,看来祺贵人所说的,,,
00:34:19.470,00:34:20.800,倒也不是全无道理,00:34:17.770,00:34:21.044,"Then it looks like there is some sense
in what Noble Lady Délice is saying."
00:34:21.640,00:34:23.970,你们几个七嘴八舌胡言乱语,00:34:21.780,00:34:24.160,You all are jibber-jabbering gossip and nonsense.
00:34:24.270,00:34:24.970,有何证据吗,00:34:24.410,00:34:25.370,Do you have any evidence?
00:34:25.230,00:34:26.310,臣妾当然有凭证,00:34:25.370,00:34:26.827,"Of course I have evidence, Your Highness."
00:34:26.890,00:34:27.970,熹贵妃入宫前,,,
00:34:28.270,00:34:29.730,温实初还曾上门提亲,00:34:27.030,00:34:30.226,"Before Noble Consort Lumiere entered the Palace,
Wen Shichu even went to her family to propose marriage."
00:34:33.280,00:34:34.390,把陈四家的带上来,00:34:33.420,00:34:34.719,Bring Chen Si's wife here.
00:34:36.530,00:34:38.190,祺贵人你先坐下,00:34:36.670,00:34:38.550,"Noble Lady Délice, you sit down."
00:34:38.410,00:34:38.990,是,00:34:38.550,00:34:39.130,Yes.
00:34:49.120,00:34:50.830,奴婢给皇后请安,00:34:49.260,00:34:50.970,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:34:51.590,00:34:52.540,抬起头来说话,00:34:51.730,00:34:53.057,Raise your head and speak.
00:34:55.840,00:34:56.500,玢儿,00:34:55.980,00:34:56.753,Bin'er?
00:35:00.930,00:35:01.630,你是玢儿,00:35:01.070,00:35:01.959,You're Bin'er.
00:35:02.470,00:35:03.630,熹贵妃还认得她,00:35:02.610,00:35:04.034,Noble Consort Lumiere still remembers her.
00:35:04.310,00:35:06.340,她是我娘家府里陈四的媳妇,00:35:04.450,00:35:06.744,Her husband Chen Si serves in my maiden family.
00:35:07.060,00:35:08.260,当年甄府获罪,00:35:07.200,00:35:08.700,"When the Zhen family was convicted,"
00:35:08.560,00:35:10.100,所有奴仆全部充公变卖,00:35:08.700,00:35:10.504,all their servants were confiscated and sold off.
00:35:10.650,00:35:12.850,要不是我家买了她给她口饭吃,00:35:10.790,00:35:13.103,"If my family didn't buy her and feed her,"
00:35:13.230,00:35:14.690,现在早就饿死街头了,00:35:13.370,00:35:14.830,she would've already starved to death on the street.
00:35:17.150,00:35:19.270,玢儿有什么话起来再说,00:35:17.290,00:35:19.410,"Bin'er, rise and say what you have to say."
00:35:19.740,00:35:21.350,奴婢不敢,00:35:19.880,00:35:21.490,"I don't dare, Your Highness ..."
00:35:21.660,00:35:23.570,罗嗦什么我只问你,00:35:21.800,00:35:23.710,"Skip the chatter. Let me ask you,"
00:35:24.030,00:35:25.370,昔日你在甄府当差,00:35:24.170,00:35:25.510,"when you were a servant of the Zhens,"
00:35:25.950,00:35:28.320,温实初是否曾向甄家大小姐,00:35:26.090,00:35:28.640,"did Wen Shichu propose marriage
to the eldest daughter of the Zhen family,"
00:35:28.830,00:35:31.290,也就是你眼前这位熹贵妃提亲,00:35:28.970,00:35:31.619,"that is, Noble Consort Lumiere, here in front of you?"
00:35:36.170,00:35:37.460,皇后面前要大声回话,00:35:36.310,00:35:37.600,Speak aloud before Her Majesty!
00:35:37.840,00:35:38.790,陈四没给你说规矩吗,00:35:37.980,00:35:39.307,Didn't Chen Si tell you the rules?
00:35:39.590,00:35:43.580,选秀半月前温太医曾上门提亲,00:35:39.730,00:35:43.720,"Half a month before the Concubine Selection,
Dr. Wen did visit and propose marriage."
00:35:44.550,00:35:45.210,不过,00:35:44.690,00:35:45.576,But...
00:35:46.850,00:35:48.960,不过不是当着老爷夫人面儿说的,00:35:46.990,00:35:49.100,But it was not said in front of Mr. and Mrs. Zhen.
00:35:52.400,00:35:55.980,是私下里到熹贵妃面前说的,00:35:52.540,00:35:56.120,He proposed in private... to Noble Consort Lumiere.
00:35:58.690,00:36:00.480,熹贵妃答允没有啊,00:35:58.830,00:36:00.658,Did Noble Consort Lumiere accept?
00:36:00.740,00:36:02.100,没有没有 熹贵,00:36:00.880,00:36:02.429,"No, No! Noble Consort Lumiere..."
00:36:04.740,00:36:05.650,臣妾以为,00:36:04.880,00:36:06.300,"Your Majesty, in my view,"
00:36:06.160,00:36:08.570,如果熹贵妃和温太医有心的话,00:36:06.300,00:36:08.936,"if Noble Consort Lumiere had feelings for Dr. Wen,"
00:36:08.950,00:36:11.040,恐怕今日就不在宫中了,00:36:09.090,00:36:11.180,she wouldn't be a concubine in the palace today.
00:36:11.960,00:36:13.950,可见熹贵妃心胸坦荡,00:36:12.100,00:36:14.430,We can see that Noble Consort Lumiere has nothing to hide
00:36:14.460,00:36:16.540,与温太医并无私情啊,00:36:14.600,00:36:16.680,and has no private feelings for Dr. Wen.
00:36:17.960,00:36:19.330,当日熹贵妃是看不上,00:36:18.100,00:36:20.715,"Back then, Noble Consort might think
a mere doctor did not deserve her."
00:36:19.670,00:36:20.540,一个小小太医,,,
00:36:20.920,00:36:23.260,但若熹贵妃从前并无半点意思,00:36:21.060,00:36:23.730,"But if Noble Consort Lumiere showed no feelings at all,"
00:36:23.590,00:36:25.380,温太医又怎会贸然去提亲,00:36:23.730,00:36:25.822,why would Dr. Wen propose to her so abruptly?
00:36:26.220,00:36:29.010,可见是有青梅竹马的情分在的,00:36:26.360,00:36:29.376,It must be that they shared some affection since childhood.
00:36:29.560,00:36:31.140,臣妾不信青梅竹马,00:36:29.700,00:36:31.770,"Your Majesty, I do not believe in childhood affection."
00:36:31.980,00:36:33.470,只相信缘分天定,00:36:32.120,00:36:34.071,I believe that Heaven determines one's destiny.
00:36:34.730,00:36:36.720,百转千回也能相聚,00:36:34.870,00:36:38.524,"Even after ""a thousand twists and turns in the mountains"",
one will still be reunited with their fate."
00:36:38.730,00:36:40.100,绝非人力可改,00:36:38.870,00:36:40.320,This cannot be changed by man.
00:36:40.900,00:36:43.440,祺贵人本宫素来知道,00:36:41.040,00:36:43.580,"Noble Lady Délice, I have always known that"
00:36:44.200,00:36:46.360,你与熹贵妃结怨已深,00:36:44.340,00:36:46.500,you hold a deep grudge against Noble Consort Lumiere.
00:36:46.870,00:36:49.320,但是这口舌易生是非,00:36:47.010,00:36:49.460,"But ""one's mouth and tongue can give rise to chaos""."
00:36:49.620,00:36:50.980,断不可胡言乱语,00:36:49.760,00:36:51.384,You must not speak baselessly.
00:36:51.540,00:36:53.030,如若真像你说的那样,00:36:51.680,00:36:53.390,"If it's truly like what you said,"
00:36:53.250,00:36:55.910,熹贵妃和温太医有私情来往的话,00:36:53.390,00:36:56.239,"that Noble Consort Lumiere and Dr. Wen had private feelings,"
00:36:56.380,00:36:57.410,那也要掩人耳目,,,
00:36:57.750,00:36:58.830,不被人知道才行啊,00:36:56.520,00:36:58.946,"they would hide it carefully, and not let others know."
00:36:59.090,00:37:01.080,若要人不知除非己莫为,00:36:59.230,00:37:01.484,"""The crime no one knows of is the crime you've never committed."""
00:37:02.760,00:37:05.590,事情做多了总有露马脚的时候,00:37:02.900,00:37:05.730,"""If you loosen your foot bindings frequently,
your horse-size feet will be seen."""
00:37:06.340,00:37:08.930,永寿宫的小宫女斐雯就见过几次,00:37:06.480,00:37:09.259,"The new maid Petunia from the
Palace of Eternal Longevity saw it several times."
00:37:09.310,00:37:11.390,斐雯你什么时候,00:37:09.450,00:37:11.530,"Petunia, report what you saw,"
00:37:11.770,00:37:13.130,看见了什么听到了什么,00:37:11.910,00:37:13.270,"what you heard, and when;"
00:37:14.230,00:37:16.840,现在都一五一十地跟本宫说清楚,00:37:14.370,00:37:16.980,tell me everything with no detail omitted.
00:37:18.520,00:37:21.610,那日娘娘和温太医说话,00:37:18.660,00:37:21.750,"That day, Her Noble Highness and Dr. Wen were talking,"
00:37:22.240,00:37:24.070,里头也没什么人伺候着,00:37:22.380,00:37:24.210,and not many servants were serving inside.
00:37:24.450,00:37:26.150,奴婢就陪着二小姐进去,00:37:24.590,00:37:26.290,"I went in accompanying Yurao, My Second Lady."
00:37:26.490,00:37:29.400,谁知奴婢就看见,00:37:26.630,00:37:28.247,And I would never...
,,,00:37:28.590,00:37:29.883,expect to see...
00:37:29.910,00:37:32.370,温太医的手拉着娘娘的手,00:37:30.050,00:37:32.510,"Dr. Wen's hand holding Her Highness's hand,"
00:37:32.620,00:37:34.450,两个人你看着我我看着你,00:37:32.760,00:37:34.590,"and they both were looking at each other,"
00:37:34.790,00:37:35.740,静静地坐着,00:37:34.930,00:37:35.955,sitting still.
00:37:36.620,00:37:38.870,温太医一看见奴婢和二小姐进来,00:37:36.760,00:37:39.010,"When Dr. Wen saw My Second Lady and me,"
00:37:39.380,00:37:40.370,慌忙地撒了手,00:37:39.520,00:37:41.114,he hastily withdrew his hand.
00:37:41.250,00:37:44.090,奴婢还瞧见温太医衣袖口子上,00:37:41.390,00:37:45.173,I also saw Dr. Wen's sleeve was rolled up slightly.
00:37:44.420,00:37:45.250,翻出来一截,,,
00:37:45.760,00:37:48.050,绣了一朵小小的五瓣竹叶,00:37:45.900,00:37:48.190,It was embroidered with a delicate pattern of five bamboo leaves.
00:37:48.550,00:37:50.340,此后奴婢越想越害怕,00:37:48.690,00:37:50.820,"Afterwards, the more I thought about it,
the more scared I felt."
00:37:50.850,00:37:52.680,怕娘娘来日知道奴婢看见了,00:37:50.990,00:37:54.254,"I was afraid that if Her Highness found out,
she'd kill me so I could never speak of it."
00:37:53.020,00:37:54.100,要杀奴婢灭口,,,
00:37:54.430,00:37:56.050,只好乞求祺贵人做主,00:37:54.570,00:37:56.416,So I begged Lady Délice to help me.
00:37:57.440,00:37:59.720,你只是一个小小的宫女就看见了,00:37:57.580,00:37:59.860,Even a new maid saw it.
00:38:00.730,00:38:02.270,那你看不见的时候呢,00:38:00.870,00:38:02.870,I wonder how many times such a thing has happened
00:38:02.730,00:38:05.150,岂不是这样的事情多了去了,00:38:02.870,00:38:05.290,when no one was observing.
,,,00:38:08.420,00:38:09.760,This is a serious concern.
00:38:08.280,00:38:12.520,事关重大 请温太医来景仁宫问话,00:38:10.452,00:38:12.660,Ask Dr. Wen to come to the Palace of Great Benevolence.
00:38:13.500,00:38:14.080,嗻,00:38:13.640,00:38:14.446,Yes.
00:38:17.250,00:38:18.280,小主即将临盆,00:38:17.390,00:38:18.680,"My Lady, your due date is approaching."
00:38:18.540,00:38:19.530,太后说外头的任何动静,,,
00:38:19.920,00:38:20.700,都不能惊动您,00:38:18.680,00:38:20.965,"The Empress Dowager said you should not be disturbed
by whatever happens outside."
00:38:21.000,00:38:22.580,让开 熹贵妃受牵连,00:38:21.140,00:38:23.140,Move. Noble Consort Lumiere is implicated.
00:38:23.000,00:38:23.910,我必得去看看,00:38:23.140,00:38:24.729,I have to go see what's going on.
00:38:24.840,00:38:26.200,此事必定会惊动皇上,00:38:24.980,00:38:26.690,His Majesty will definitely be notified.
00:38:26.550,00:38:28.160,皇上再怎么说也会帮着贵妃,00:38:26.690,00:38:28.451,His Majesty will help the Noble Consort.
00:38:28.510,00:38:29.670,您安心养胎就是,00:38:28.650,00:38:30.151,"Please rest assured, for the baby."
00:38:30.300,00:38:31.420,再不然真有什么的,00:38:30.440,00:38:31.761,"If something really happens,"
00:38:31.810,00:38:32.840,您再去也来得及呀,00:38:31.950,00:38:33.244,it won't be too late for you to go then.
00:38:33.310,00:38:35.390,万事还是您腹中的胎儿要紧,00:38:33.450,00:38:35.643,The baby in your belly is more important than anything right now.
00:38:40.100,00:38:40.890,那好吧,00:38:40.240,00:38:41.256,All right.
00:38:44.110,00:38:46.940,黄荒两钱 东阿阿胶三钱,00:38:44.250,00:38:47.080,"Astragalus, two maces;

00:38:50.780,00:38:51.490,江公公,00:38:50.920,00:38:51.894,Mr. Jiang.
00:38:52.740,00:38:55.650,温大人 皇后娘娘请您,00:38:52.880,00:38:55.790,"Dr. Wen, Her Majesty is asking you"
00:38:56.040,00:38:57.370,即刻前往景仁宫一趟,00:38:55.790,00:38:57.760,to visit the Palace of Great Benevolence now.
00:38:57.620,00:38:59.610,下官从不侍奉景仁宫,00:38:57.760,00:38:59.750,I have never served Her Majesty.
00:38:59.920,00:39:01.580,不知皇后娘娘为何要传召啊,00:39:00.060,00:39:01.909,Why is Her Majesty summoning me?
00:39:02.000,00:39:03.040,那就得问您了,00:39:02.140,00:39:03.850,That's something you should ask yourself.
00:39:03.710,00:39:05.330,温大人请吧,00:39:03.850,00:39:05.470,"Dr. Wen, please."
00:39:12.890,00:39:13.550,公公,00:39:13.030,00:39:13.916,"Sir,"
00:39:18.940,00:39:19.920,今日还没有,00:39:19.080,00:39:20.410,I haven't checked
00:39:20.270,00:39:21.560,给惠嫔娘娘请过平安脉,00:39:20.410,00:39:21.700,Concubine Vertu's pulse today.
00:39:22.150,00:39:24.310,万一耽误了太后娘娘的盼咐,00:39:22.290,00:39:26.240,"This was specifially ordered by the Empress Dowager.
It'd be a sinful offense if the task is delayed."
00:39:24.980,00:39:25.970,这罪孽可就大了,,,
00:39:26.440,00:39:27.850,那你想怎么样呢,00:39:26.580,00:39:27.990,What do you intend to do then?
00:39:28.150,00:39:29.520,容下官进去请过脉,00:39:28.290,00:39:30.226,"Please allow me to check her pulse,"
00:39:30.320,00:39:32.030,即刻便与公公去景仁宫,00:39:30.460,00:39:32.434,and then I will go with you immediately.
00:39:33.410,00:39:33.990,去吧,00:39:33.550,00:39:34.545,Go ahead then.
00:39:52.390,00:39:54.130,娘娘的临盆之期就快到了,00:39:52.530,00:39:54.459,Your Highness is due soon.
00:39:55.010,00:39:56.470,微臣在您的药方里面,00:39:55.150,00:39:56.610,I added some herbs
00:39:56.760,00:39:57.880,又加了几味药进去,00:39:56.900,00:39:58.020,in your prescription
00:39:58.520,00:40:00.220,能够确保娘娘在生产的时候,00:39:58.660,00:40:00.360,"to ensure that during labor,"
00:40:01.060,00:40:02.890,一切顺利痛楚稍减,00:40:01.200,00:40:03.332,everything will go smoothly and you'll experience less pain.
00:40:06.230,00:40:07.470,我见你神色匆匆,00:40:06.370,00:40:07.799,You seem to be in a hurry.
00:40:07.820,00:40:08.980,是要往哪里去吗,00:40:07.960,00:40:09.309,Are you going somewhere?
00:40:10.360,00:40:13.070,太医院少了些药材 着微臣去办,00:40:10.500,00:40:13.474,"Some herbs are in shortage at the imperial infirmary.
I was assigned to take care of it."
00:40:14.530,00:40:16.940,起风了 就不要再出门了,00:40:14.670,00:40:17.080,It's windy. Don't go outside today
00:40:17.790,00:40:18.520,免得受凉,00:40:17.930,00:40:18.886,in case you catch a cold.
00:40:19.500,00:40:22.490,是望你速去速回,00:40:19.640,00:40:22.630,Yes. Please come back soon.
00:40:23.460,00:40:26.250,我还有重要的事情找你,00:40:23.600,00:40:26.390,I... have important matters to discuss with you.
00:40:39.770,00:40:42.130,启禀娘娘温太医到了,00:40:39.910,00:40:42.270,"Your Majesty, Dr. Wen is here."
00:40:47.770,00:40:50.690,给皇后娘娘请安 给诸位小主请安,00:40:47.910,00:40:50.830,Peace to Your Majesty. Peace to My Ladies.
00:40:52.360,00:40:53.020,起来吧,00:40:52.500,00:40:53.280,Rise.
00:40:55.570,00:40:57.110,温大人得罪了,00:40:55.710,00:40:57.760,"I cannot avoid this offense, Dr. Wen."
00:41:04.710,00:41:08.120,这绣纹很别致 是一直都有吗,00:41:04.850,00:41:08.260,"This embroidered pattern is unique.
Has it always been there?"
00:41:09.500,00:41:11.340,微臣的母亲素爱翠竹,00:41:09.640,00:41:11.782,"Your Majesty, my mother loves green bamboo,"
00:41:11.880,00:41:13.250,所以微臣的袖口,00:41:12.020,00:41:13.465,and therefore she embroidered
00:41:13.550,00:41:15.160,都由家母亲自绣一竹叶,00:41:13.690,00:41:15.489,the bamboo leaves at my sleeve openings
00:41:15.510,00:41:16.590,以表思亲之意,00:41:15.650,00:41:17.032,to remind me of my family.
00:41:17.510,00:41:18.380,皇后娘娘,00:41:17.650,00:41:18.634,"Your Majesty,"
00:41:19.060,00:41:22.300,臣妾以为温太医袖口上的花纹,00:41:19.200,00:41:22.440,I believe the embroidered pattern on Dr. Wen's sleeves
00:41:22.770,00:41:24.260,也不是一日两日的了,00:41:22.910,00:41:24.400,has always been there.
00:41:25.020,00:41:28.140,但凡是个有心人都会留意看见的,00:41:25.160,00:41:28.280,Anyone could have seen it at any point in time.
00:41:28.860,00:41:31.560,这也说明不了什么呀,00:41:29.000,00:41:31.700,It doesn't prove anything.
,,,00:41:32.250,00:41:33.280,That's strange.
00:41:32.110,00:41:35.190,这就奇了 小小太医见了贵妃,00:41:33.431,00:41:35.630,"When a humble doctor meets the Noble Consort,"
00:41:35.490,00:41:37.230,怎么倒像进了自己家门一般,00:41:35.630,00:41:37.760,"how come he acts as if he was in his own residence,"
00:41:37.620,00:41:39.030,翻了袖口面对面说话,00:41:37.760,00:41:39.547,rolling up his sleeves while talking to her face to face.
00:41:39.620,00:41:40.570,如此下去,,,
00:41:40.870,00:41:42.320,以后太医进了贵妃殿里,00:41:39.760,00:41:42.708,"If this continues, in the future,
when the doctor visits the Noble Consort,"
00:41:42.790,00:41:43.990,翻袖口的翻袖口,,,
00:41:44.370,00:41:45.410,解衣裳的解衣裳,00:41:42.930,00:41:45.566,"they'll both be rolling up their sleeves
and unbuttoning their shirts."
00:41:45.670,00:41:46.870,还有什么事不能做的,00:41:45.810,00:41:47.500,Is there anything they're forbidden to do?
00:41:50.170,00:41:52.380,那日是熹贵妃叫了微臣,00:41:50.310,00:41:52.960,"That day, Noble Consort Lumiere summoned me"
00:41:53.050,00:41:54.630,去问惠嫔的胎像,00:41:53.190,00:41:54.770,to report on Concubine Vertu's pregnancy.
00:41:55.010,00:41:56.590,听得惠嫔胎像一切正常,,,
00:41:56.930,00:41:58.380,一时高兴赏了微臣喝茶,00:41:55.150,00:41:58.560,"When Her Noble Highness heard that everything was well,
she was pleased and awarded me tea."
00:41:58.850,00:42:00.090,是微臣在喝茶的时候,00:41:58.990,00:42:00.480,"I rolled up my sleeves while drinking tea,"
00:42:00.470,00:42:02.090,卷起了袖管失了礼仪,00:42:00.610,00:42:02.230,and lost my manners.
00:42:02.600,00:42:03.760,一切都是微臣的错,00:42:02.740,00:42:04.051,"It's all my fault, Your Majesty."
00:42:04.600,00:42:06.310,若非熹贵妃除你之外,00:42:04.740,00:42:06.639,It is precisely because Noble Consort Lumiere
00:42:06.690,00:42:08.800,再不把太医院任何一人放心里,00:42:06.830,00:42:08.940,trusts no one else in the imperial infirmary
00:42:09.400,00:42:11.010,又如何会托付你去照顾,00:42:09.540,00:42:12.621,"that she entrusted you to take care
of her good sister Concubine Vertu."
00:42:11.360,00:42:12.770,与她情如姐妹的惠嫔,,,
00:42:13.400,00:42:15.360,看来熹贵妃与你的情谊,00:42:13.540,00:42:17.161,"It looks like the relationship between
Noble Consort Lumiere and you is truly extraordinary."
00:42:15.700,00:42:17.030,当真是不一般哪,,,
00:42:17.820,00:42:18.690,小主 你,00:42:17.960,00:42:19.245,"My Lady, you..."

They are as distant as the autumn moon in the water.",00:42:41.140,00:42:59.140,"The dreams I dimly recall;
The past I hardly remember,
amidst the autumn moons and the spring flowers.
Like the moon's reflection on water

And before I knew it, we fell apart.",00:42:59.140,00:43:19.140,"The joyous sounds you brought;
The silence you left;
Changing faster than clouds can turn to rain.
Our minds resonated;
Our hearts beat in unison;
But we lost what we once possessed."

Before me lie the flute and the zither.",00:43:19.140,00:43:36.140,"A poem to converse;
A melody to accompany;
A heart to bind to mine.
I hoped for endless longing and eternal promise,

With my heart, I committed;
With my arms, I embraced.
I desired to be remembered;
Desired to be cherished;
Why am I only hated and deceived?"

Behold the mockery of destiny and the game of fate."

But the irresistible winds of destiny destroyed her wish.",00:44:14.140,00:44:33.140,"Praying for a bright moon;
Praying for a rising sun;
Dreaming to bask in the spring breezes.
